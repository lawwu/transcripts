craft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2" target="_blank">00:00:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Without changing your job yet,

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you build systems that are going to ensure that two things

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the show where I answer questions and give advice to my audience about the quest to live and work deeply in an increasingly distracted world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=62"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So last episode, last week's episode came out the day after Christmas, but Jesse and I recorded it a week earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we sort

<span class="t">So this episode here is coming out early in the new year, but we're recording it just a few days after Christmas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we're recording this, we are still in the middle of the holiday break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So last week I said, "Shoot, Jesse, we should have dressed up for the holiday episode."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I figured today we would rectify that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're watching the YouTube version of this show, which you can find at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,</span></div><div class="c"><span

normal blue shirt, but a festive red shirt in honor of Christmas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse also dressed up once again, I would say, not unlike with his Halloween costume.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not fully pleased. I think Jesse maybe took it too far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, Jesse, why don't you explain your costume to us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Skeleton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Jesse, I appreciate that. I mean, you have a Christmas hat on. That's kind of festive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know why you're reprising your skeleton costume from Halloween.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That seems a little bit out of sync with a little bit out of sync with the holiday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I tell you a Christmas joke? I don't think so. I'm really not interested in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we call when Santa's elves have a dance party?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Skeleton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hold on one second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, look, we got to just burn the HQ to the ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, just completely demolish it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm thinking maybe even salt the earth where the building once stood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, all right.

So I am solo casting today, which meant, yes, I did have to carry a skeleton across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">downtown Tacoma Park to bring it to my studio today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My son, my oldest son, is here with me as well in the studio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's hanging out with me today.

OK, you have in your mind's eye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, think about the exact opposite of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the way my son was looking at me as I carried a skeleton in a Christmas hat to my quote unquote work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Well, anyways, let's let's get rolling with today's episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's what I was thinking. Like I did this summer because I'm by myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was thinking, why don't I do just straight up old fashioned question extravaganza question after question after question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No other segment. It's New Year's. This is the time when we're thinking about changing our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just get into advice. My original idea was to do 23 questions for 2023.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That turned out to be too many. So I took off 10. So what we're going to do today is 10, no, 13, 13.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right. Twenty three minus 10 is 13, 13 questions for kicking off 2023.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's checking everything. My big fear here when I'm solo casting is that I accidentally leave it on Jesse Christmas skeleton for for the entire episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the people on YouTube are just going insane. But no, it's on me. The audio is working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got 13 questions for 2023. You'll notice that at least half of these questions are about big picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What should I do with my life type issues? Because I felt like that is an appropriate theme for the New Year period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we step back and think big thoughts are going to have it. We have a high concentration of these questions around big think about changing their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was a Danny whose hours shrunk, whose work got more corralled, whose attention to the rest of his life expanded,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whose

three different things going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:37:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're worried that idea is not very clearly thought through, that you like psychology, but just going to study psychology,</span></div><div

Jesse, what do you call them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Skeleton plans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a key aspect of our multiscale planning philosophy that we talk about here on the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have these plans that cover three to four months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You use those to inform your weekly plan each week. Your weekly plan informs then your daily time block plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Kevin is saying, "I have a hard time. Most of the work I do, I have a hard time accounting for it in a plan that covers three or four months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because the work arrives often unpredictably. It requires three or four days to complete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2699" target="_blank">00:44:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not quite sure. Sometimes it piles up. It's just hard to predict. I'm a litigator."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Kevin, my response is that type of work doesn't need to be specified in your strategic plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your strategic plan should recognize most of my cycles will be handling these briefs that are going to show up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so I want to recognize that in my strategic plan and not have a huge load of other things you're thinking you're somehow going to get done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What should be your strategic plan, though, is anything that you do want to make progress on that is not part of this sort of ongoing flow of briefs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to be well served by a strategic plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're like, "Maybe I'm working on this initiative. I'm trying to master this new whatever, this new piece of the some sort of penal code or whatever that will then help my practice."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so your strategic plan says, "OK, this fall, this winter, I want to master this information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2749" target="_blank">00:45:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That means I'm going to have to read these things, then take this course, and then go spend the day, sign up to do a day-long training."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And your strategic plan might say, "Let's evaluate each week as we get to it to see if it's a busy week or non-busy week."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The busy weeks are where we have more than four briefs that have piled up. We do nothing on those weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The non-busy weeks, I want to do Monday, Wednesday, Friday mornings, 90 minutes in the law library at the office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a great use of the strategic plan. You have a strategy laid out for how to make progress over a longer period of time on a non-urgent but ultimately important project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2785" target="_blank">00:46:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Kevin, that's what should be in your strategic plan."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2788" target="_blank">00:46:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These type of work that you're not just going to do in the moment, you don't have your briefs in the strategic plan, but your plan recognizes that those exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have another question here. This one's from Bartholomew, who says, "I'm involved in the establishment of a new academic research society, which involves creating a website, starting a bulletin, and hosting a conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm trying to get my team to adopt a Newportian strategy with role-based rather than person-based communication. I need some help getting started."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Good use of Newportian. I do like the idea of that becoming a term of art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, role-based communication. For those who don't know, this is an idea from my book, "A World Without Email."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is if you have a team or an organization, instead of having all communication be associated with individuals, you know, jesseskeleton@calnewport.com,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you have communication channels associated with roles or different types of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where you get support, for example, at calnewport.com. You can extend that idea to all sorts of different types of roles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, client queries could be an email address. You could have, and I've seen this before, an email address set up for each of your clients where the address is specific to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have a skeleton polish company as one of your clients, instead of them just having the email address of someone who works at your company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they have a skeleton polish@client.companyname.com, and they send to that address. That address is just for their communication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2892" target="_blank">00:48:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This allows you to break the connection of communication with individuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not just email addresses, by the way. You can use other types of tools. We talked about our sponsor, Notion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could have like a Notion workspace they communicate in. You could have a shared document. You could have a ticketing system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You could have a chat bot. I don't really care about the technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the point here is that you have incoming channels tied with roles or specific type of work, not with individuals in your company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is that important? Because when a communication channel is associated with an individual,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we implicitly associate with that channel the conventions that we're hardwired for when it comes to interpersonal interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're a social species. So we're wired to be social. We have a lot of expectations, a lot of instincts around sociality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of those instincts, for example, is if like I ask you something, you answer me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're wired to think if someone in my tribe 70,000 years ago ignores me when I'm asking them a question, this is a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe we have a beef going here. Maybe I'm going to get a mastodon thigh to the back of the head if I'm not careful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We really worry about it. We expect really quick communication. That carries over to our current world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have Paleolithic brains in a modern world. So then I send an email as a client. I kind of want a response right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, why is this specific person not responding to me? I read in the responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is this person always have this tone with me? When you're instead sending using a role or work specific channel, all that goes away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I'm sending a query to like my client name at client.CalNewport.com, I have completely different expectations that if I'm sending that to Cal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if I'm sending that to Jesse. And on the flip side, you at your organization can have a different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can now very clear rules for how this happens. You cover this on this day. You covered it on that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We take shifts. Multiple people look at it. We have a daily. This is an example from my book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote with that email. This is daily quick client stand up where we look at all the incoming communication from the last day and we translate it into task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we answer the quick things and we figure out our responses for the other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we farm out that work to specific individuals. This means that in between those daily stand ups,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no incoming messages you have to monitor and respond to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm a big fan of role based communication as opposed to person based communication, if you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3038" target="_blank">00:50:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Bartholomew, I gave a lot of examples there. Email addresses at a domain that aren't tied to people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a big one. Non email based, non email based channels is another big one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, they can be simple. Here is a shared Google Doc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have our upcoming client check in meeting dates in bold. Just write in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, anything you want to talk about, any questions, put in notes, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll get to that at the upcoming meeting. I think that's really good. Office hours is really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a client, you know, office hours for these issues and different people might be there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but you know when that time is and you come to those office hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything that depersonalizes interaction between you and the outside world, I think is a good way forward, if at all possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. We got one more strategic question here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we got another big picture query. So here's another more strategic question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This comes from Local Optimizer, an AI researcher from New York City.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Local Optimizer asks, how do you plan for research projects that have a large variance in how long they could take when you're building out your strategic plan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, strategic plan, quarterly plan, semester plan, all the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3112" target="_blank">00:51:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It covers roughly a three to four month period of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the thing. In your quarterly plan, you might be identifying this is a big project I'm working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're not being super specific about exactly how much time you're dedicating to this and when.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That really happens more at the weekly plan scale if you're doing multi-scale planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might say, I'm working on this research project this semester.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to try to get to a result by whatever, February.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's in your weekly plan that you say, where am I on this project? How much time do we need? Oh, man, I'm really behind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I'm going to put aside the first half of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, all day Friday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm dedicating to this. We really got to make progress. Or on the flip side, it's in your weekly plan where you might say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we're waiting to hear back on something. So I'm not going to spend any time on it this week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, hey, this is done. Let's just clean it up on Monday and this project is done. Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll use the rest of my week for other things. So it's really in the weekly plan where big picture endeavors gets translated to actual effort plans for the extension of actual effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you make the weekly plan, you assess where am I? And you allocate time appropriately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you will naturally titrate back and forth how much time you need based on how the project unfolds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it finishes early, great. You either have breathing room or you can say there's two months left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go back and update our quarterly plan and add another project into it. So no big deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question here from Brian Mark.

It's a search for Cal Newport New Yorker quiet quitting. I actually talk about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a little bit of a plug for that piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have this issue where we put too much power into the notion of a dream job and it skews our otherwise systematic lifestyle, center, career planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What I want you to do is put aside the notion of dream job and get much more specific about the properties that that specific job has that makes it attractive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're doing your lifestyle center, career planning, this is going to include many different aspects of your life where you live, the neighborhood, family, what your pace is like, what the environment is like, what you're involved is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3324" target="_blank">00:55:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's also, of course, going to involve your career. And I want you to have attributes of that career that are appealing to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So forget the label of dream job. What is it about animation in L.A. that was appealing to you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's pull that out in the attributes and maybe it's prestige. Maybe there's an excitement or a magic to be working on something in the film industry and movie stars come in to do the voice recording.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe there's just there's something about the artistic expression and that type of animation. I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But get rid of the dream job label and let's just get clear about attributes. You do your lifestyle center, career planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's all the different things in my my my lifestyle vision, including the attributes of your job, ideally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3366" target="_blank">00:56:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you do the standard calculus. What are my different paths forward to try to acquire as many of these properties as possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there might not be an option that gives you all of them. So you're sort of weighing. I could see a path here that gets me all of these things, but not that this path gets me those, but not this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3383" target="_blank">00:56:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you're making judgments about different combinations of different lifestyle attributes to figure out which of these packages I think is the is the highest or most appealing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3393" target="_blank">00:56:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you execute that plan. So your job gets reduced in this vision to appealing properties that are there being judged right along other appealing properties like the type of house I can live in, proximity to friends and family, the lifestyle pace, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3408" target="_blank">00:56:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it puts everything on the playing field. When you do that, I don't know what you'll find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, like maybe you'll find, for example, I'm just this is just hypothesizing just to give you a sense of how this type of planning goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you find, OK, there's no movie studio animation jobs in Florida, but I can I can have a career vision. It'll take me a few years to get there where I have 75 percent of those attributes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe I'm more seriously teaching animation and on the side in doing these sort of like creative animation projects, especially in the summer. And that really scratches the itch of creative expression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe even I want to put things on the the awards circuit. I don't have some of the prestige of the L.A. animation studio, but hey, I got two out of three things I care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3456" target="_blank">00:57:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe you find, you know, if I move to L.A., it's not as bad as I thought. Yeah, my my friends aren't there, but I'm you know, I'm looking instead about the job, the DreamWorks job in L.A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where I'd have to live in the valley somewhere. I'm looking at the Emeryville Pixar headquarters and I have an offer there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's this quirky, you know, I can live in Marin and this sort of quirky, this quirky community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, you've worked this through and we could we could build a really cool lifestyle there and be a cool place for the for the kids to grow up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3485" target="_blank">00:58:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'd be outside and there's a bunch of the animators families live there. You know, I can I can get 80 percent of what I like about the lifestyle location and communication arc of Florida.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can actually get that in California and get all the job attributes. So let me do that. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like so these are the type of decisions you might make once you start. Comparing apples to apples, packages of possible lifestyle attributes to other packages of possible lifestyle attributes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the way I want you to think about it, where people get tripped up again as they just give too much energy to no, no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My dream job is like bonus plus 10. And you see that somehow is different than just this job has these attributes, which I like, which I can compare to these other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This job has some of those attributes. It's like this is dream job. This isn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3530" target="_blank">00:58:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that has a way of pulling people in the situations where all of these other aspects of their life you lose that they like you lose from your lifestyle and net net.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone's unhappy. So forget about the dream job. Change things to properties, lifestyle properties and start making some objective comparisons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. A couple of short questions here. Brian Mark had another question. How do you make time for quality time with your life with such a busy schedule?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3560" target="_blank">00:59:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Brian Mark, I don't know why you assume I have such a busy schedule. I work during the busiest parts of my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Standard 40 hour work week hours. There's long periods of my life where I work. I'm home much more such as the summer semesters when I'm teaching release are extensive breaks that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This, I think, is a common misnomer that comes up. And often when you see practitioners, what I now call slow productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3586" target="_blank">00:59:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those who do slow productivity where we're always working at a reasonable pace, but constantly sort of patiently putting in time towards things that are important to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3595" target="_blank">00:59:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Over time, a lot of different types of accomplishments pile up. Here's these books. Here's these New Yorker articles. Here's these academic articles. Here's this show you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The human instinct. Is to take all of the supporting effort for all of these different accomplishments that were patiently developed over time, flexibly, slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3615" target="_blank">01:00:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And collapse them and imagine someone working on all those things at the same time. Man, you must be writing books at the same time you write New Yorker articles at the same time that you're doing academic articles, the same time you're doing this show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You must work all the time. This is the illusion that slow productivity creates, because if you zoom out to larger timescales, even a very reasonable, flexible pace can aggregate a lot of interesting work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to the outside world, it'll seem like you must be really busy. I am not a very busy person. So I'm done work by five. I don't work on weekends, except for I sometimes do Sunday morning writing sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not a particularly busy person compared to just about any other job out there. So Brian Mark, that's not an issue. But I do appreciate this moment to talk about a theme that's gone through this episode. One of the themes that's gone through this episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We saw this in the case study. We saw this other places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Working intentionally, slowly, the natural pace, but obsessing over quality on stuff that really matters. Being wary about the distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Batching that or dismiss it when possible allows you to live a very reasonable, very flexible, very sustainable lifestyle that if you add up the years looks like to the outside world to be very impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd say that's one thing we've talked about today. The other thing that comes up again and again is lifestyle centric career planning, lifestyle centric career planning, lifestyle centric career planning. That's the second theme.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3698" target="_blank">01:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The third theme. I think has to do with skeletons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's do one more short question here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3708" target="_blank">01:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ahmed says, I heard you mentioned once that you write book reports on the book you read in order to conceptualize the information better. Can you talk a little bit more about this process? Ahmed, I do not do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWe3Ieuf9ng&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't write book reports.
