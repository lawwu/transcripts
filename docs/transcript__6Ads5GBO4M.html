It's Curious Mike here with another episode. I'm here with the boxing legend, Ryan Garcia, my boy. I appreciate you pulling up, my dude. Man, I'm excited to have you on, bro. I got a lot of stuff to talk about, but to start it off, I feel like a lot of people are kind of confused where you're at in your career right now.</p><p>There's all this talk about you being banned from the sport, and then there's talks about you getting in big fights again. Where really are you at? Because you're in the prime of your career. You're 27. You look jacked, my dog. So where are you right now? I mean, right now, I would say after that year ban that I had and coming off of that, I just kind of was trying to figure out my feet again, like where I am and I are at.</p><p>What should I do? And just kind of figuring myself out again because I kind of hit the rails a little bit. Life got ahead of me a little bit, but now my heart is just, I want to fight the best fighters and take them on. Tefema Lopez, Devin Haney, running back with him again.</p><p>I wish I could have fought Tank, but he's fighting Jake Paul. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it is what it is. Get that money, but it's kind of a bad move. I feel what you're saying. I feel like we're young. I feel like we're young. We should get to it.</p><p>We should get everybody. Fact. I mean, you've already accomplished so much in your career, and then having that year ban, did that take away the joy for you for a little bit? Are you getting that back? And kind of like, how are you feeling with that? Yeah, man. I kind of, I got really depressed.</p><p>And at the time, bro, like my mom had got cancer. Like, it was just like one thing after another after another. And one, I do feel like they wrongfully banned me. You know, I never took steroids in my life. I'm like, that's crazy. Yeah. So, all that combined kind of just got me depressed.</p><p>And me trying to come back, I was like, just not feeling it. Like, I hit the road. I'm like, damn, I'm not feeling it. There's so much like, I don't know, like, in the sport of boxing, there's so many conspiracies that happen. Like, oh, is this guy trying to lose on purpose just for this check?</p><p>Is this guy, did Ryan really take these whatever? And obviously, like, you stand on the fact that you didn't. And how do you, like, what is the conspiracy even behind the fact that they could, like, paint a picture like you did something you didn't? Like, how is that? Because in the NBA, it's like, man, we take these tests, they come back positive, they come back negative, whatever.</p><p>Like, that's, it's a simple thing. But in boxing, I feel like there's so much conspiracy, like, jumbled up in it. Like, like, why is that so common in boxing? And, like, run us through that story about how that even, like, happened for you. Well, I mean, the difference between, like, you know, the NBA and boxing is, like, the NBA is, like, run by an organization.</p><p>Like, boxing is kind of the wild, wild west. Like, everybody is just in it for themselves. You got, I mean, you got, like, the WBC and stuff like that, but there's not, like, a one sanctioning body kind of overseeing everything. So, you know, my fight with the Haney's, like, I got tested before with, you know, Javante fight and, you know, other fights where, you know, obviously it never came positive on anything.</p><p>So this fight in particular was a little weird because the Haney's are, you know, with this organization called Snack. And Snack is ran by this guy named Victor Conte. Now, Victor Conte was one of the biggest cheaters ever in baseball. He got banned from baseball for life. Like, he was feeding the steroids to, like, Barry Bonds and everybody.</p><p>So, Victor Conte is severe, like, super connected to VADA, which does the testing for this fight. So, you know, it was just weird how, like, I got tested for, like, three months straight and nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. And then all of a sudden, I'm positive the day before the fight and after, like, I chose to take steroids the day before the fight.</p><p>That doesn't even make sense to do if anybody thinks about steroids. You got to be on them for a minute to even have a benefit. Exactly. And it was a billionth of a gram. But at the time, like, I was, like, saying some crazy shit. But I was really trying to, like, get in Devin Haney's head.</p><p>Like, people weren't understanding. Right. That's part of boxing. That's part of the sport. And I feel like, man, if you know any, if you know sports, like, at all, like, there would be no point in drug testing you guys if they weren't going to come out with a positive or negative before the fight.</p><p>That makes no sense. So the fact that all that came out after, I feel like that's common sense for a lot of people. Man, the weirdest thing about that was his little brother was, like, about two weeks before the results came out or whatever, whatever that story came out.</p><p>He said, you know, I was praying to God and, you know, and I don't know. It just seems like I feel like he's going to, you know, God told me he was going to test positive for steroids. Like, bro, come on. He's a little kid. So I know he's, he fucked up.</p><p>Like, he fucked up. Like, he's going to, like, I know his dad and his brother were like, what the fuck are you doing? Why would you say some stupid shit? So he kind of already gave out the, like. That's what I'm saying. But that's, you know. Because how would he know before everybody else, before the organizations know, before everybody knows, before fucking I know?</p><p>How would he know? How would he know? So it's like, I know they were behind that and I'll stand by that. That's like, that's like some, some real, like, deep, like, conspiracy stuff that that can even, like, happen like that. Especially the fact that now, didn't they take the loss away from him?</p><p>So now he's apparently undefeated. Undefeated. Everybody, everybody saw that fight, you know. Nah, they've definitely seen it. You know what I mean? You can't, you can't, you can't erase that, you know. Even though they tried to erase it from the internet, which was even crazier. Really? Yeah, and then they sued me.</p><p>Did they get, did they get any money? Nah, nah. They didn't, they, uh, I forgot what we did, but there was like a deal we did where you have to, like, you got to take off that lawsuit, everything. But he was really trying to sue me for battery. And, you know, I don't know Devin Haney.</p><p>He may be, you know, you know him better than me. He may be a great dude or whatever, but I feel like as a, like a, as a man, like, the fact that after the fight, he was continually just speaking on the fact that you took steroids. And he wasn't accepting the fact that, like, he got beat up in the ring.</p><p>Like, to me, I would just be trying to get my give back. I wouldn't be harping on the, this dude, like, if we're playing dudes in the NBA, like, it doesn't matter if they were taking something. You still got to put that ball in the hoop. You still got to put the ball in the hoop.</p><p>You still got to perform. You still got to show up and do your job. So to me, that wouldn't be what I would go to as a competitor, saying, no, like, he was, he was on this or that. I would just be trying to get my give back. So why, why do you feel like he's not just trying to get back in the ring with you and run it back?</p><p>I think for him, it was more of an emotional loss that he took. Like, he really felt like he was going to beat me. Yeah. And I was messing with him emotionally bad. Like, I was coming at him from every angle. Like, you know, calling him, you know, Diddy Haney, you know what I mean?</p><p>Like, all this shit. Like, I was really trying to get it in his head because he's a great fighter. And I knew that, like, all right, like, I got to get him off his game somehow. Right. So I'm going to act crazy. I'm going to go crazy on this dude.</p><p>Yeah. And, you know, he kind of fell for it, bro. His dad was getting pissed. His dad told him, you know, you're going to meet him in the middle of the ring, which is horrible to do with me because I'm a powerful. You know, I hit hard. So, you know, all those things, like, I think just took a toll on him more and more.</p><p>And then, like, when you lose in that fashion, like, he didn't just lose. He got his ass cooked. And he was pound for pound supposed to be the next Mayweather type of. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you get your ass whooped like that, it's going to have an effect on you in a way where it's going to make you act out of character.</p><p>Like, I never really seen Devin Haney act like that. He's more so of a, you know, very competitive dude. I mean, I've been knowing him since I was nine years old. Right. You know, that's something I never really thought he would be like. But, you know, I think it's more influenced by his dad.</p><p>But who knows? Are y'all going to run it back at any point? Like, what for you, like, what are you looking to line up next? I'm looking to line up a fight with Teofimo Lopez. Okay. You know, that's who I want. You know, I just feel like, you know, when the timing is right and when, like, my heart, I know, like, I'll beat this guy.</p><p>Every time I have this feeling, I beat the person. Like, like, 100%. Like, there's times I'm like, damn, I don't know. But, like, this for sure. Like, I know he's seen as, like, you know, a great fighter or whatever. But I just know, like, when I get in the ring with him, like, I'm going to put it down.</p><p>So that's my first plan. And then after that, I do want to run it back with Haney. Or even fight Manny Pacquiao. You know, Pacquiao has an opportunity. I mean, he did good his last fight. He got a draw. But, you know, he competed with a young dude at 147 pounds.</p><p>So, I mean, we've been talking. So that might happen, too. I mean, you definitely are one of the biggest shows in boxing. I know people can't wait to see you out there. Walk me through, like, because, you know, I play basketball. It's a completely different sport. I mean, we both are professional athletes.</p><p>We both have to kill our bodies to be great. No one knows the behind-the-scenes grind of being, you know, a professional athlete. But as a boxer, it's mano-a-mano in the ring. Like, it's you versus one other person surrounded by these fans. Like, walk me through the process of, like, that.</p><p>Like, how does it feel to be in the ring 1v1? Like, do you feel... Because you seem to me like you fight pretty loose. And I feel like as a fighter, if you get nervous and whatever, like, that's going to affect reaction time. It's going to affect you. Everything.</p><p>Like, for you, how have you been able to, like, perform the way you do? Like, walk me through how that is as a boxer for people that don't know. Because I feel like fighting is so much different than any other sport. Yeah. I mean, the thing I noticed about boxing is it's so much mental that it's, like, you have to go into a place.</p><p>Like, where I go into a place that's, like, very spiritual. I don't know how other people do it, but I come in, like, very spiritual. Like, just praying every day. Like, I just get, like, immensely into, like, just God. And just, I channel that, you know, I channel that and just kind of fight with that essence in me.</p><p>Like, I'm fighting for God. I'm fighting for something else. You know, not myself. And I'm willing to die for that. Like, if I'm willing to die for anybody, it's going to be God, right? So, like, that's how I get into it. And then, like, I just get this sense of just, like, everything floats away.</p><p>Yeah. And then... All the pressure. And then, yeah. It's, like, lifted off me. Like, I don't feel nothing. Like, I'm willing to die, but I'm not going to die. I'm going to kill this motherfucker. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's, like, it's a whole thing. And then, like, when that energy comes in from the crowd and it's just, like, it's freaking crazy, bro.</p><p>Like, you turn into a different person. And then, when you... Imagine you knocking somebody out in front of everybody. Just... Yeah. Bro, you... Like, it's, like, no other feelings. It's fucking nuts. I can tell in your voice that you obviously, you know, you love this. I know that, like, that sport...</p><p>Man, the media in general, when you're a professional, like, it beats you up from all different angles. It does. But I feel like... And life in general, too. Life in general. Everybody goes through it as an athlete. It may be different, but everybody, you know, life beats you up.</p><p>But, like, man, you're special. Like, your personality, I feel like the message you stand for, like, you can be a real vessel that God uses. Because no one... If you ask people that question, they're not immediately... Most people aren't immediately going to go to, I pray, I ask God, and He helps me take the pressure away.</p><p>So, like, even if it's not for your own fame, your own money, or whatever, you've got to keep going. Because not a lot of people in your shoes are, like, giving the glory to God. And I feel like that's what a lot of, you know, this generation or just, like, this timeline is, like, missing.</p><p>Like, bro, we kind of forgot our, like, you know, our root, our connection. You know what I mean? Our purpose, really. Our purpose, really. You know, all the other stuff is cool. But, you know, that right there gives you that sense of hunger and that sense of drive. And I feel like everybody inside has that.</p><p>Right. We just have to, like, you know, tap into it and search for it. And honestly, I would love to be a vessel as best as I can. I'm not perfect, though. Everybody knows me. So, you know, I'm not perfect. But I do try to put my best foot forward for God and for His kingdom.</p><p>And I try to put, you know, I guess whatever I, you know, whenever I have that sense of urgency that God places on my heart, I don't hesitate to speak it, is what I will say. Do you feel like it's frustrating sometimes, like, the Christian people on the Internet or people in general, that they look at you preach God, they look at you talk about Jesus, and then they see things that, in their mind, make it seem like you're a hypocrite or this or that.</p><p>When all of us are imperfect. All of us are hypocrites, if you really think about it. You could be the worst of sinners and still proclaim God, and you're still proclaiming God. It doesn't take away from the fact that... What I say to people is, like, His word is the truth, not mine.</p><p>So when I speak His word, that's His word. That is not my word. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not... Jesus said only God is good. I'm not even good. You know what I mean? I'm far from it. I'm just trying to grow every day. And I feel like, you know, Holy Spirit is working through me to change me and, you know, and just, like, kind of work through me.</p><p>I mean, that's just a process. I just feel like a lot of Christians, like, you know, Lecrae. You probably listen to Lecrae. And he talks about, man, like, in his dark moments of depression or whatever, acting out. It was Christians that attacked him the most. And I feel like you're another public figure that is very outspoken for Jesus.</p><p>And I feel like you have been beat up by Christian people. And is that sometimes discouraging for you? Or have you handled that pretty well? I feel like as a boxer, a fighter in general, your skin is probably very thick. But does that get to you at all? It does get to me.</p><p>You know, honestly, it's like when it rains, it pours, right? It's like when stuff is going hard in your life and then you have this coming at you and, you know, the people that you think would uplift you, you know, and pray for you are the ones beating you down.</p><p>You know, it can, you know, take a toll on you. But anything in life, right, bro? Like, we are all about perseverance. You know what I mean? They came at Jesus, right? They wanted to kill him. Well, they did. Well, then he rose. But I'm saying, like, that's just the process of life.</p><p>You know, process of being a Christian, process of being a human, process of trying to do something great. It's like we're going to have to fill these moments and then persevere. I mean, that's really the key to life is perseverance, resilience, and being a fucking dog, you know, in every aspect, you know, how you take negativity, how you receive good publicity is like both you got to be careful with because one, you could get too high-headed and think you the shit, and all of a sudden, boom, you're going to get smacked.</p><p>So it's kind of finding that balance. Like, you know, I am that guy, but I'm also not that guy. You know what I'm saying? Have you, because you've experienced so many, like, high highs, like you've beaten some really good boxers and you have experienced some low lows, like, do you feel like you found a good way to balance that, not getting too high or too low?</p><p>Yeah, man. Even just recently, just from that year and just, like, coming from that, I really have learned that, like, it could happen to me. Like, you could, I could get lost. I never really thought that, you know what I mean, for myself. But, you know, with all that, it's like, I understand that, like, I'm not superhuman.</p><p>Like, I really felt at one point I was superhuman. Like, I could take on everything. Like, I could fight. I could do all this. And, you know, and I could still, you know, nothing's really affecting me, you know, but it did. It really did. So, for me now, it's, like, kind of always understanding myself and not letting myself get too ahead of myself.</p><p>Just, like, okay, we're not going to force nothing no more. Just whatever's for me is going to be for me. Timing. Everything's about timing. Time and time and time. Can't force nothing in life. So, I just, like, wait for God's timing. And when I know it's time, let's roll.</p><p>You know what I mean? So, for me, it's, like, I've been chilling now. Kicking back. But when it's time to go, it's time to go. Man, I, um, one of the reasons I wanted to even get you on this podcast is because I always respect people that are, like, authentically themselves.</p><p>And you are the, like, epitome of being Ryan Garcia, unapologetically Ryan Garcia. Yeah. What are some of the things that you feel like you stand for that publicly you get backlash from that you continue to, like, stand ten toes on? Well, one, obviously, my faith, you know, you could feel the pressure when you start talking about God with people that, you know, you know, you just, you just know.</p><p>You could feel, like, a tension in the air. But also, like, I was standing up for, you know, you know, children's sex trafficking. I mean, I've always been a big advocate on just, like, stopping it and, you know, really caring for those kids because it happens all across the world and not a lot of people talk about it.</p><p>So, that's another thing. Facts. That, that's just, like, for me, it really breaks my heart. You know, I have three children. So, for me, that was a big thing that I wanted to, you know, talk about. And then, uh, just, like, being against council culture, like, you know, the people that are not with that, you know, I don't really like that.</p><p>You know, it's like a mob type of thing and you, you affect free speech and, yes, there's times where people, you know, shouldn't say some sort of shit, but they should be called out for it. They shouldn't be, they shouldn't be, yeah, it shouldn't be a culture of, hey, you can't say nothing about this.</p><p>And you can't disagree with someone. And if you disagree from the public, now you're completely canceled. Like, I haven't been super outspoken about that, too. And, man, the child sex trafficking thing is, it's crazy you mentioned that because this past summer, I went to the Philippines on a missions trip.</p><p>I never went on, like, a missions trip before. I went with a church group. We went out to the Philippines because that's, like, a real red zone for children getting trafficked. They have so much poverty out there that, man, it's own parents of children that are trafficking their own kids.</p><p>They're putting them on, they're putting them on web Zoom calls and making the children do things to each other for some, for some guy in America who's paying to watch this wild stuff. And it's, it's sickening. And that's like a, that's like a passion of mine, too, because, like, that is one of the most under-talked about crimes.</p><p>Like, there's 800,000 or some crazy stat of children that go missing a year. Where are they really going? And there's so much, like, pedophilia. And it's a billion-dollar industry. There's so much pedophilia that, yeah. Who's spending that money, bro? Who's spending that money? Who is the one keeping this under wraps?</p><p>Like, it's such a under-talked-about thing, and that's for a reason. So, like, the fact that you speak on that, the fact that I'm willing to go support that, like, there needs to be more people that are willing, and people, like, you know. It's a hard conversation, which I get it.</p><p>It's a hard conversation. I get it. Like, it makes people. But it's reality. It's reality. It's really happening, and it's really happening to real kids, happening to real families. Man, if you, like, I got to go play with these little kids that had gotten rescued out of being trafficked, you know.</p><p>Yeah. I got to, like, see their... And these kids are traumatized and damaged for life, but to just put smiles on their faces. And so who cares, like, about the sensitivity that grown adults are having when this conversation is brought up? Because it's really happening to real kids. The only way to help it is to talk about it, you know, at the end of the day.</p><p>So, you know, we could all get up on all these other things and try to support, you know, other movements. But this is, like, one of the hardest things that, I mean, I've had to listen to and just listen to the stories. And, you know, for me, it's like we should all together as a society, like, come and try to help, you know what I mean?</p><p>I mean, like, it's still happening, you know, it's still going on in the world. And, you know, us as, you know, people in general, just people, we should go in and help. I remember you got, like, called crazy on the internet or something because you were going on lives or something and speaking on some of your own experiences, some things that...</p><p>Right. And people were saying, oh, he's just on drugs, oh, he's tripping, da-da-da-da-da. I've never done drugs in my life. And everything you were saying, like, I know that stuff is true. And so the people... Well, it's right in front of the faces. Like, if you just do a simple search, you could see that it's real.</p><p>You could see all that stuff. What was some of the, you know, the Twitter rants or some of the stuff that you were talking about in terms of this? And, like, is that stuff that now, because of backlash, you are, like, hesitant to talk on? Or do you stand on some of that stuff?</p><p>I mean, I'm always going to stand on stuff, you know? Like, I'm not, like, a super big conspiracy theorist, but, you know, I do know a bunch. You know, you mentioned it. And some are real. And some are real. You know what I mean? At the end of the day, like, people really didn't know about the Bohemian Grove, but that's actually been around for a minute.</p><p>Like, it's a real thing. Like, real politicians got together into the woods, which sounds crazy, and did, like, weird rituals. I don't think it's that far-fetched, because once people get money and then they get fame, the only next thing is power. And some of this stuff that people are into when you get up there, it's really about power.</p><p>It's about control. Like, y'all call me crazy. That's crazy. Yeah, that's right. Like, bro, I don't care how big I get. I ain't going to no woods and celebrating an owl and it's burning, and you guys feel like... Do you feel like... But that's a real thing. I know when people hear it, it's like they think I'm lying, but no, it's a proven thing.</p><p>I think it's real. Yeah. Yeah, no. I think that... Do you feel like, though, when you speak on that, like, even though it's truth, do you... I respect that you're fearless, because there's people that would be so hesitant to talk about that know it's true or know that some of these conspiracies really happen because they're scared they might get canceled or they might die or they might be labeled as a lunatic and be blackmailed.</p><p>Which when you start talking about this stuff, you usually get labeled as crazy, lunatic, weirdo. But at the end of the day, like, you could look at me, I'm chill as hell. Yeah. Like, I'm not. So, like, I really wasn't fearing that. And I just felt like it was my mission to start speaking the truth shit.</p><p>And honestly, some of this stuff, like, oh, yeah, like he was talking about, you know, the LGBTQ immunity and all that, you know, I was talking about when they do the parade, show their junk to kids. That's not okay. You know what I mean? But at the end of the day, that's wrong.</p><p>You know what I mean? And then when. What did you get backlash for that for? Because how I worded it. Really? If you don't say the exact terminology, the exact perfect way, then they're going to get very offended. Yeah. So that was that. But also, it's like, they mocked Jesus Christ at the Olympics.</p><p>Like, what am I, I'm going to push back a little bit, just like, you know. But then again, I'm not going to be mean to people. Like, if you're gay, you're gay. I don't care. Yeah. You do you. There are certain things that like, everybody needs to be held accountable in any type of, you know, you know, what's it called community?</p><p>Yeah. Like, I don't care what community you're part of. Like, if you're doing wrong, you're doing wrong. You know what I mean? It's just what it's like. Nobody should have favoritism. Just because they're like, oh, they're a community that gets, you know. Bullied, so now they can do whatever.</p><p>They almost become the bully. Yeah. Because nobody can call them out without getting canceled. Yeah, I understand. Which I don't believe in canceling. It's stupid. I understand exactly. You know what I mean? It's like, damn, you can't call them out because of what? When they were, if they were, if that community was doing something messed up.</p><p>If my brother was killing somebody, I'm going to tell him, bro, watch the fuck out with you. Like, hey, you know what I mean? I'm going to call out my brother. It's the same thing. You know what I mean? Like, just because, you know, it's taboo to call him out, it's like, nah, bro, like everybody should be called out.</p><p>I don't care the fuck who you are. I understand that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Well, man, like. That's always been my heart. It's like, nobody should have power just because they've been attacked before. No. It's like, no. If they're doing wrong, they're doing wrong. They're doing right, they're doing right.</p><p>Cool. And that's so true and simple that people will still try to miscommunicate and people will still try to. You don't get what we've been through. You don't get that. The LGBTQ community has been going through. Like, bro. I already can hear the comments. But at the end of the day, like, truth is truth, right is right, wrong is wrong.</p><p>And in the day and age we live in, that's getting so twisted. It's getting so twisted. And it says in the Bible. Such a fine line. It says in the Bible, like in the end times, like, right will become wrong. Wrong will become right. And I feel like it's becoming slowly.</p><p>It's getting there. Where, like, you can't really tell anymore what people are going to view as right or wrong. Or if you're speaking truth and you're speaking facts and you're being a hunter and whatever, people will still find the wrong in that. Society's getting so weird, bro. It's like everybody's so sensitive.</p><p>Like, that's my whole thing. It's like, damn, bro. What are we becoming? Why you can't just tell your truth? Or even if it's not the truth, why can't you state your opinion on something without getting canceled? Nowadays, you can't even speak your opinion without getting canceled if it goes against the mass.</p><p>Even seeing, like, that is like, oh, like, what is he talking about? Like, it's just so crazy nowadays. I know, bro. It's so weird, bro. Like, I can't believe. I'm like, what? I feel like I'm in a Black Mirror episode. I'm in a house that look like a Black Mirror episode.</p><p>I'm scared. You know what? I did a podcast right before yours and the guest said, man, it's kind of cool once you get canceled because once you get canceled, you're free. Now you actually get to speak on things that you get to speak on. And obviously, like, you should be, we should be careful as, you know, Christ followers that we don't want to go out of our way to offend people or hurt people or whatever.</p><p>But at the end of the day, like, when you speak truth nowadays, a lot of times it's going to offend people. I think it's kind of cool that, you know, they may take something you say on the internet and label you crazy. They may, you know, this past week has been a little, a little, a little rough for me because I might speak my opinion on something.</p><p>People may disagree with it. But it's kind of cool that once you are labeled as that, you kind of, you kind of are free. You kind of escape the matrix a little bit. And you break, you break from that chain of fear. You know what I mean? That's really what's bound to you, fear.</p><p>Fear. Because we are basically saying what people are already thinking. Exactly. And at the end of the day, when you do that, you could see the community of truth seekers coming back you up. They're coming back you up. And I think there's a difference. There's a difference. It's starting to be more and more.</p><p>Like there's starting to become a very clear cut line of people that are cheap versus not cheap. People that think for themselves. People that are trying to, whatever, wake up. And people that are trying to, and people that are just stuck in their programming. A hundred percent. I feel like there's not a lot of people with the platform you have, with the platform that you know I have that are actually able to overcome that fear of not worrying about what the masses say.</p><p>The only thing we got to worry about is the other side. They have bots, bro. Like I know it's crazy, but they have little bots that we're going to go in your comments. They're not real people. Yeah, and they're going to try to, they're going to try to push the narrative that they want to push.</p><p>A hundred percent. And then normal people will look at those and see that, "Oh, this is what everybody's thinking about this. Let me hop on and agree with them." Yes. So I already peep all that. Y'all not slick. Yeah. They definitely, they definitely do that. It's a whole thing.</p><p>But like, that's like true though. Like that's like, they could have smear campaigns with bots. Like that's a real thing. And that's why I feel like. It's crazy. You know about the Bible. You read the Bible. You know about when you talk about end times and you talk about the coming of like some of these, these end times things, this is the perfect day and age for some of this to happen because whoever this Antichrist person is, he needs to be able to create narratives.</p><p>I understand. And you need social media to do that. So the fact that now you have AI, you got social media, you got these bots that are willing to create whole narratives. Brainwash people basically. Brainwash people. I feel like, man, like when you talk and that's why I feel like that it's so important that people that are willing to speak about these subjects do because we're just having a conversation.</p><p>We don't know when some of this stuff will happen. But the fact that we're actually willing to say there will be there will be signs. And, you know, I've had a lot of supernatural spiritual experiences where, you know, I cannot deny Christ and that's just, you know, something that I feel like I've always been called to do and spread that message.</p><p>And, you know, I do feel like, you know, like you said, we never know, but it definitely feels intense. I say that, like, especially trying to speak truth. Yeah. It's never been more intense to do that, you know, and it's never been, you know, there's never been this much fear.</p><p>Right. I'd say that. There's never been this much fear. There's never been this much. We live in a very peculiar time. For sure. Man, I do want to get into a little, because even though this is the stuff that I love to talk about, there's a lot of fans of yours that want to hear a little bit about just the boxing side of things and then we can maybe transition back a little bit, but for you, as the elite boxer that you are, what does like a, because you come off very careful, you come off like even during training camp, you're drinking beers, you're doing this, you're having fun.</p><p>What is a real training camp look like for about how intense is it and probably like what was your most intense one? Ooh, yeah. I would say a real one, like not a Devin Haney training camp, that was a little different. That was like a slight, like you weren't even.</p><p>Like I was going hard, like don't get me wrong, like me and my coaches, we don't play around, like we get to business, but my, like after a night of training or day of training, I'd drink at night and fucking just. So you weren't worried at all? Nah, I had no fear.</p><p>It was crazy. It was like I already knew, like I was chosen to kick his ass. Really? Bro, I had this crazy ass confidence, it was insane bro. Like I was just like, I'm going to drink this beer and I'm going to beat, I literally drank a beer before the fight, like dead ass.</p><p>So you, that's crazy. Bro, I was just. He was supposed to be, he was undefeated? Yeah. We're the best in the world. I was like 101 underdog at one point. And you weren't tripping at all. Nah bro, I had no. There's some dudes in the league like that though, that they swear like, they like to go out, they like to have fun.</p><p>They swear if they lock in too much, they're worse. They perform worse. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't perform worse, but I have to have some type of getaway. Like I can't just be in the house all the time. I can't like, I'm still going to go out, still hang out.</p><p>Like I won't drink. Like most of my training camps, I didn't drink. You know, I only drank that one, you know? So like most of the time I'll lock in for four or five months with no drinking, just, you know, training, but still going out. Like I'll still go out and do whatever, but I can't be too, like, too.</p><p>Is it, is it true? Is the, is the rumor when boxers are getting ready for a big fight that they go celibate and they try to bust no nuts? Oh, I heard that. Nah, but like, I don't know, bro. It never really happened to me, bro. I ain't gonna lie.</p><p>I never got weak. I've actually like had sex the day before the fight and like next day I knocked out the guy and wore it around. Yeah. So like it might affect other people. Really? I would suggest not to do it because I guess it can slow me down, right?</p><p>I was, I always wondered if the elite boxers that like, if they really try to like store up their testosterone and just go. For me though, the difference, like the thing that can like throw me off is if I eat before I fight. Really? I don't like to eat.</p><p>I don't like to have nothing in my stomach. I like to kind of be in a fasted state and I perform better. So that's me, but some people say don't bust nuts, you know? Do you, like I said, bro, you look shredded dog. You look like you're in the prime of your career.</p><p>Yeah. How long, how much longer, like I feel like Tank, for example, some of his, he's been outspoken about it. It's been weighing on him. He doesn't know how long he wants to do this. For you as a 27 year old, like how much longer do you want to do this?</p><p>Like, do you feel the same way? Do you feel the weight of it? Or do you just still love it and you want to just do it as long as you can? I mean, it's like almost like one day I feel like I want to fucking destroy everything. And the next day I'm like, man, let me just chill.</p><p>Like, you know, but for me, my heart, my heart is still always going to be in it because as a little kid, I just wanted to be whatever Floyd was or Oscar de la Hoya was and do these huge fights and have people do gatherings. Like when I was little, my family used to have like little parties and watch the fights.</p><p>You know, that's just like an experience that I want to give to people. And one, I just always feel like it's my mission to fight. Like I don't have nothing else. Like I didn't do anything else. I've been boxing since I was seven years old. I dropped out of school.</p><p>That's all I did. So it's like- The one that I've been hooping and it like, I feel like- I'm getting my second wind though. Like for a little bit, I was like, oh man. But now like I'm kind of, I feel like I'm going to like more of a manhood type of feel for it.</p><p>You know what I mean? Before it was like, I was a little kid, you know? 19. I was like, oh, I want to become the biggest. I want to do this. I want to throw a big fight. You know, I did that with Tang and all that. But now I feel like I'm coming into like real manhood and I'm like, okay, like I'm ready to really destroy shit now.</p><p>Yeah, that's fire. Yeah, that's hot feel. That's fire. Do you feel like boxing because of the influencer culture, the Instagram views, the whatever, like, do you feel like it has taken away some of the purity of the sport? And I'm specifically talking about like this Jake Paul Tank thing.</p><p>Yeah. Tank's one of the best in the world, you know? Yeah. fighting Jake Paul who obviously he's not very proven in the boxing world, but he's very, you know, he draws big crowds. Yeah. He's a very like famous dude. He's going to bring money to the fight. Do you not like that type of stuff?</p><p>Have you been outspoken about that at all? This one specifically I didn't like. I don't like this for the sport because one, Jake Paul established himself as a cruiserweight, which is he's ranked, right? Some organization ranked him as a cruiserweight. Tank Davis is a lightweight. Yeah. You know, and to the casuals and people that are watching, they're not going to see that.</p><p>They're going to see Jake Paul, Gervonta Davis. They're not going to care who weighs who and, you know, what are the particulars. And it kind of just like, it's going to make boxing look bad. It's going to make it look like this guy that really can't fight, be able to do good against the guy that is pound for pound.</p><p>Like they're hurting the sport. Like in this fight, they're hurting the sport. I agree. I mean, I feel like more and more of that stuff is kind of happening. Even the Jake Paul versus Mike Tyson, that was nasty, bro. That was nasty work. That was nasty work. Nasty work, bro, is onk.</p><p>No, he's worse. He's OG. That was nasty work. Bro, they did my guy bad. And, you know, look at, man, I don't hate on people getting that bag, but you got to know the long-term effect of it. Like people are going to see the sport in a much different way.</p><p>And you're giving... What is Tank getting paid for? He got to be... I wouldn't say... I would say he's not getting paid less than 20. Really? Yeah. He's up... He's around there, 20, 30 mark. Yeah. And for one fight, it's kind of... That's hard to turn down. It's just as frustrating that that can even be arranged.</p><p>Right. Why can that even be like arranged as an actual thing that's going to happen? It's insane. Like who's allowing a cruiserweight to fight a lightweight? I mean, that's pretty much of a disgrace. And Jake Paul trying to come at me and saying, "Oh, but you wanted to fight me." I said, "Bro, I'm way bigger than Tank.</p><p>There's a big difference." And that does... Because you had to really shrink to fight Tank, right? Yeah. And that was like three years ago. So it's like... Or two years ago, whatever, how many years it was. So it's like, I'm way bigger than Tank. Tank's last fight was 133.</p><p>And he's 5'4". Jake Paul's 6'1". And a heavyweight. So you think Jake Paul has a real chance? And even if he... I mean, I guess it's an exhibition, but yeah. I think that he... I think he's going to surprise a lot of people. I mean, how's Tank going to...</p><p>Like there's weight classes for a reason. Yeah. He's huge compared to Tank. And Jake knows how to fight somewhat now. Yeah, like he's actually gotten... It's been years, bro. Like we're not falling for that you're a Disney Channel kid no more. Like we're not. Like I'm not falling for that shit.</p><p>Yeah. If I ever fought him, it would be a real... Like I'm training. You're training. Yeah. And guess what? Nobody was taking shots at Jake when he was trying to fight. You know, Julio Cesar Chavez. Like okay, that makes sense. You guys the same weight, whatever. Or you know, Anthony Joshua, I guess he wanted to fight him.</p><p>Like I'm just coming at you because he's saying he wants to fight a lightweight. And he is fighting a lightweight. When is that fight? November 14th, I think. Yeah. So what are you at right now? What are you at? I'm like 170. And Tank's like 130? I think he walked around like 140, 160.</p><p>So how little did you have to get in order for that tank? Oh, that was insane. 136. You looked like a skeleton. Oh bro, I was fucking dead. That was the only fight. Like I said, that was like damn bro, I shouldn't be fighting. But I did anyways, you know.</p><p>So people that like judge boxers off of a fight where they have to come down in weight, they're not realizing the implications of like. Oh, it's dead. Or what you actually went through in training camp. Walk me through like if you're really trying to drop this weight, what are you putting your body through?</p><p>Like what did you put your body through? So you're dehydration. I mean, it's a process of water weight, but you're basically sucking all the water out of your body. And you're not eating for like however long. Like when you have to cut, cut, cut and it's bad, bad. Like it just gets nasty bro.</p><p>You have like your lips are all chapped. Like you're basically killing yourself to make the weight. I mean, you see the boxers. Is that how you felt in there? Oh bro, I was dead. Like you can't recover from that in one day. And he had a rehydration clause. So it was not like I could just eat whatever I want.</p><p>So it was like I needed more, but I couldn't do more because it was only a 10 pound thing. Yeah, that's rough for sure. It was rough bro. Because I can't imagine running around playing a basketball game after being dehydrated, not eating a lot and feeling like I can't imagine.</p><p>And then trying to ball in front of millions of people the best you can. It's just really hard. What I tell people is like, can you even play ping pong dehydrated? Not really. So do you feel like when you're at your prime, when you're fully like you at your ideal weight, do you feel like you're the best in the world?</p><p>I do. I do. I feel like there's not people that could beat me. I got the speed, power, reflexes. I got everything. So for me, if I'm at my best, it's hard to beat me. Like Diffen Haider was supposed to be the best. Yeah. One pound for pound fighter, right?</p><p>Yeah. I beat him pretty easy. So it's like, I know I could do that to anybody. You got to keep going, bro. Yeah. I'm trying to see that. Like if you fought Jake Paul right now, what would happen? I would knock him the fuck out, bro. Like in what round?</p><p>I don't know what round, but I'm knocking him the fuck out, bro. He's not beating me, bro. He didn't try to organize that fight or he's not trying to fight you? Nah. I don't think he's trying to fight me, bro. But if y'all got real beef and you're closer to his weight, like why not?</p><p>I feel like we should run that, right? I don't know. I think it's me and his brother got a little something on. He sued me for coming out. I said shit about prime. Oh, for real? Yeah. But little stuff like that, I feel like that's when you run a fight.</p><p>That'd make it bigger. Yeah. That'd be dope. That's like a petty thing where it's like, we don't want to give him money or whatever. Oh, really? Yeah. I don't know. What's your biggest paid fight? How much did you get paid for your biggest fight? I got paid over 30 million for a tank fight.</p><p>Yeah. Because the pay-per-view numbers, they were crazy. 1.2 million sold. They haven't hit a million since then. Nobody has hit a million. So getting that bread from a fight, because a lot of guys, probably Mike Tyson, he probably took that fight for the check, you know what I mean?</p><p>I don't know what situation he's in, but if you take money for a fight, but then you lose, do you, after the fight, still feel like really good about that? It's a bittersweet thing, right? Yeah. It's like, fuck, like, damn, I really lost. And, you know, I was so, I think I got impressed from losing all that weight that I wasn't even thinking about the money at that point.</p><p>It was just after the fight, I was just like, fuck, bro, I don't feel good. But like, later, later, later, I was like, damn, I really got 30 M's in the bank account. 30 M's. And you all get it all at one time, right? Nah, it's like broken up, because like the pay-per-view sales, like they got to come in.</p><p>Oh, so like over how long of a period of time? Because like us? It took like seven months to get paid. Oh, for real? We got 20 million, oh, 12 million check here, 10 million check later, five. It was like, the numbers got to come in. So being as a young dude, I think you're probably what, 25 at that time?</p><p>Yeah, 24. Like having pretty much the world at your hand, all the women in your DM's, all the money, all the fame that you could want. Like, how fulfilling is that for people that want to be in your shoes for those things? Yeah. For the money, for the women, for the fame.</p><p>How fulfilling is that to you when you get it? It's like, what's it like? It's like anything in life, short dopamine doesn't last. Yeah. You know, it's like a drug. It's like a drug. You're always going to want more and more and more. But at the end of the day, it's vanity.</p><p>Like, you know, the story of Solomon, you know, he had all the women, he had everything, the riches. And at the end, he said, this is all vanity. This is all nothing. And honestly, that's what it is. It has no substance. It doesn't fulfill you in any real way.</p><p>You know, it's actually going to leave you empty. And, you know, you're going to be by yourself and, you know, searching for, you know, what really mattered in life. Yeah. You know, so for me, you know, I had to go through it. And what I would say is, you're probably going to go through it, whoever's watching it.</p><p>You know what I mean? It's like something that you kind of got to go through at this level. It's like, damn, like, you do have that. I mean, you're human. You're going to try to, you know, see what it's about. But if you can't and you choose, I would suggest not to really get into it.</p><p>You know, too caught up in that. Because like I said, it's almost like you're about to get a hold of something and then it disappears in your hand. That's what it feels like. It's always there. He kept saying, Solomon kept saying a chasing after the wind. Yeah. That's what it is.</p><p>That's the perfect way to put it. I kind of described it like, you're chasing the wind. You're not chasing shit. That's crazy. And I feel like there, you know, like Jim Carrey said a quote. Or was it Jim Carrey or was it somebody else? There was a quote that was like, I wish everybody could get everything they ever wanted so they could realize that that should not be the goal in life.</p><p>And there's so many people that still are chasing those things that are vanity. And there's very few people that actually, you know, reach all their goals. And the people that reach their goals, they can speak from a different perspective than people that never reached their goals that are still searching for this stuff.</p><p>But you are one person that has become the biggest boxing star in the world. You've gotten the money. You've gotten the fame. You've gotten the women. Everything that a young dude might be pursuing. So you have a unique perspective on that. So what would your advice be to like young dudes watching and their goal is to be the next Ryan Garcia, but it's for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>Right. Like what would you tell them? I would say have that hunger, have that drive to want to do all the things you want to do because I'd never want to discourage anybody to do that. No, go for it all. Now, for the reasonings, that's only going to leave you dry and empty in your life.</p><p>And that's something that, you know, I've learned. And I hope that me saying it can pass on to you so you don't get caught up in any of that. And you just go and win and, you know, you make your family proud because that's who's going to be with you.</p><p>And, you know, you make God proud above all. So for me, I would just, you know, speak that message into whoever's watching it. That's fire, bro. Man, like I said, bro, I really respect you. And I do feel like me and you both like, yeah, we're given a platform.</p><p>I feel like our mission is my mission is not basketball. Your mission is not boxing. That's what we were blessed to do and it's what we love. But our mission is speaking truth, bro. And you're one person that keeps it a hundred. That's why I wanted to have you on here.</p><p>I felt like, you know, when we ran into each other in the lobby of the Waldorf that one time, I was like, man, I got to get bro on the podcast. I got to travel up with you, bro. I feel like when you believe in God and have that truth in you, you kind of gravitate to truth speakers.</p><p>And like, that's something that, you know, I always felt when I came across you. Like, man, he got that light in him. So it's like somebody that, you know, of course I was going to do this podcast to God too. But at the end of the day, that's how life is, right?</p><p>It brings you around the right people at the right time and timing's everything. So thank you for letting me be on Curious Podcast, you know. Curious Mike, man. Curious Mike. My bad. Curious Mike, man. Yes, sir. Ryan Garcia, man. Curious Mike out. Yes, sir.</p></div></div></body></html>
