And I'm going to guess that some of them are internal. We could point to head or we could point to heart, doesn't really matter. But like when you think of sources of motivation, do you have a palette of them that you can dip into?</p><p>Do you even feel the need to dip into them or is it really just all about action steps throughout your day? Or if I can even venture into the somewhat, you know, harder stories that I've heard you talk about, do you sometimes think back and you're like, listen, I'm going to do this because there are a bunch of guys that are dead now that can't.</p><p>And so I'm going to do it because I can. What are your, what are the paints on your motivation palette, if you will? Well, you probably, you probably heard me say that motivation isn't something that I am going to count on because it's just an emotion that's going to come and go.</p><p>And it's just like feeling happy. You feel happy right now. Maybe you won't feel happy in 15 minutes. You feel sad now. Maybe you won't feel sad in 15 minutes, you feel motivated right now. You might not feel motivated in 15 minutes, therefore I can't rely on it. So I'm not going to put any, I'm not going to put any money on just being motivated because it doesn't really matter to me.</p><p>So the daily actions that I take aren't from motivation. They're just from discipline. Like I said earlier, I'm not going to get up and go through some big debate about, well, do I really feel like doing this? No, I don't feel like doing this, but it doesn't matter. I'm just going to go do it.</p><p>Now if we start to look at sort of a broader movement through life and continuing to try and move forward and move on, you know, uh, my buddy Seth died and he was the Delta platoon commander in tasking to bruiser and he, he died in 2017 and it was in a parachute accident.</p><p>And it was, it was, I mean, it's definitely unexpected. Um, and, and also he'd already been through multiple deployments, um, was with, with us, with me in the battle of Ramadi. He then went back into solder city and, and led a ton of very dangerous operations. And then he did other deployments and was kind of done with his deployments, kind of done.</p><p>And now he's just talking about when he's going to retire and he's a couple of years away from retirement. And, you know, I'm talking about, Hey, we're going to work together again. And it all seems like we're on a pretty good path to just move forward. And then he ends up dying in a, in a parachute accident.</p><p>And he's a guy that, you know, was really just kind of, you're, you're, you're not going to be able to replace any, any, you can't, there's a uniqueness to him that is, you're not going to find. And, you know, I've got some stuff that he wrote, he was an incredible writer and I will like try and write something like him.</p><p>I can't, we can't do it because he had a bigger vocabulary and a more articulate way of writing. And so I can't write anything as well as he wrote it. He was incredible at guitar. He played guitar, played ukulele, like sick, like an incredible at playing guitar. And he's a total knuckle dragger, like a total meathead knuckle dragger.</p><p>You know, his nickname was unfrozen caveman because he just, he just, you know, look like a big caveman. And yet he spoke French and, you know, could recite French poetry and was really good at learning languages. And he was an artist and he had, you know, what's synesthesia is, you know what that is?</p><p>Yeah. Emerging of the senses. So people, they can see colors and. So he didn't know what it was. Oh, sorry. I see colors. I hope most people can see colors. Sorry. That can hear colors and, and can associate particular colors with sound or like particular keys on the piano.</p><p>It's, it's, it's pretty rare. Some people think they have it, but true synesthetics are pretty rare, but they don't have to fight for this trait. It just kind of emerges for them. He didn't know it, but one day he was talking to me and he was embarrassed to tell me, he's like, you know, what's weird is when I, when I think of numbers, I, I have colors in my head and, and I go, what do you mean?</p><p>He, and he says hollow was zero. And I remember seven is yellow. I don't remember any of that, but he, he just rattled off like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. You know, he says, you know, hollow, white, clear, all of, you know, just rattled off these colors.</p><p>So he had this, this, he had that synesthesia and it gave him some kind of weird ability to memorize numbers. So, you know, he'd be in a bar and talk to some girl and he'd say, what's your number? And he would just, he would know it for two years.</p><p>He would just know it. And that also made him incredibly good at playing guitar because now like the scale and the fret board of a guitar is this, it's a mathematical thing that he has all in this weird, this weird coloration scenario going on. So there's, so he's this guy and you know, and, and very, a very emotional guy, a very emotional guy who would, you know, you know, I was talking earlier about being a balance for someone.</p><p>I had to balance this dude out on a daily basis sometimes, you know, he'd be so mad about something, you know, one, one day he'd be, I hate the teams, I hate all these guys. And I'd say, yeah, I get it, man. And the next day I'm on never getting out of the teams, you know, he would, he would oscillate that bad.</p><p>And I would tell him, Hey, you're, Hey bro, you're oscillating again. And just would do anything. And he, and he loved his guys and would do anything for his guys. And so when he died, you know, we're, we're at his, we're at his, it's not his funeral. It's before the funeral.</p><p>It's like the, the open casket thing, the wake thing. And myself, his brother, Alex, Leif Babin, who I wrote extreme ownership with, and JP Dinell, who's one of my brothers who, who works with us at Echelon Front now is with us in Ramadi and was very close to Seth.</p><p>And we're like, everyone kind of cleared out for us. And we, we go in there and I think JP gave him, JP had one of those memorial bracelets with guys' names on it that had died and JP gave that to him. And I think Leif gave him some surf wax cause also Seth was a, was a surfer.</p><p>And and I gave Seth his black belt cause he started training jujitsu with me and he had, he had his purple belt, he'd gotten his purple belt. I gave him his black belt and, and everyone was just quiet. And you know, JP was telling the story the other day and, and I just said, we will not fail him, meaning that him, Mark, Mikey, Chris, Seth, and countless other guys, they, they're not here.</p><p>They don't have the opportunity to do the things we do. They don't have, they only have the opportunity to get up in the morning. So that's what it is, man. I won't fail those guys.</p></div></div></body></html>
