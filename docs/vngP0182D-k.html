There are processes that recur over and over again, for example, in writing books</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">or writing a poem. So let me talk about the creation of a book, not the creation of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">poem. Those are very different creative processes. And we could do poetry at another time if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">anybody cares about that.

So I have six steps that I'll mention that I pass through in writing a book. Number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">one, first, a seed thought or a seed idea is sown in my mind, usually by something I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">reading or something I'm hearing either positively because I so much want to dig into that seed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and flesh it out or negatively that I hear something or I read something I so dislike</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that I want to give a beautiful alternative view of reality. So that's the seed. For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">example, the seed thought for The Pleasures of God, the book The Pleasures of God, was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">while I was reading Henry Scougal's little book, The Life of God and the Soul of Man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when I read this sentence, "The worth and excellency of the soul is to be measured by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the object of its love," that was like a lightning bolt into my brain. When I read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that, the thought sprang up, "Is that true for God, that the excellency of God's soul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is to be measured by the object of his love?" Could I present a fresh picture of the worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and excellency of God by focusing on what he loves? And the kind of love that Scougal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is talking about is not agape love towards your enemies in spite of how disgusting they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are, but it was a delighting, affectionate sense of something you find pleasing. So what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">does God find pleasing? What does he delight to do? And the book was born. The seed for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">future grace, the book Future Grace, was the thought, "Nobody sins out of duty.

So the key to killing sin is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">severing its root by the power of a superior promise." And the book was born, all 400</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pages of it, from that reality. Yeah, kill sin by the power of a superior promise because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">nobody sins out of duty.

They're not all that long. The gathering step. Here, I simply throw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things into a big electronic file from all over the place.

So I'm not worrying about any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of sequence or order. I'm just throwing stuff in a file. This is gathering, filling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">up a barn with all kinds of hay. For example, when I wrote "What Jesus Demands from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">World," the seed thought was Matthew 28, 20, which says that we are to teach the nations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to observe everything Jesus commanded. And I thought, "Where's a book that does that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that helps a missionary teach his disciples everything Jesus commanded and how to observe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it?" So I took several weeks, read through all four Gospels, cut and pasted all the imperatives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and all the implied imperatives into one document. Hundreds and hundreds. I think there were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about 500 entries in that file. It looked hopelessly daunting. I just stared at it for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">days thinking, "What in the world will I ever do with this? Everything Jesus commanded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is what has been given to us, and we're supposed to teach it to the nations." So that was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">gathering step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Number three, third step, praying and reading and thinking and doodling on pieces of paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">toward a conception of structure. What in the world am I going to do with hundreds and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds of imperatives from the Gospel?

How is it to be presented?

And I think it's the step that kills most writing projects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vngP0182D-k&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and kills most writers.
