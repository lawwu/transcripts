What is the main difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=125">00:02:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">between encoder-only and encoder-decoder transformers?

What you can do is pick any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=251">00:04:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">historical tragedy or big moment in history, and then place yourself just before that occurrence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=258">00:04:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm visiting Lisbon, which had a massive earthquake in 1755 at 9am.

I said, I'm standing on the banks of the beautiful river Tagus in Lisbon. It seems like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=271">00:04:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a lovely day.

I'm glad you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=277">00:04:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">enjoying the view. However, I have some bad news for you. No kidding. It gets into character and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=281">00:04:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">then says, the tremor occurred about 9.40 local time.

That's realistic. Find a high and open place where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=293">00:04:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you can take shelter from falling debris and rising water. The final sentence is quite interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=298">00:04:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">from a language model.

I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=329">00:05:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">sorry for your situation.

The next new thing you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=339">00:05:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">can try is debating famous thinkers or philosophers from history.

Makes a comparison about what it's believed to be a portrait of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=447">00:07:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and believed to be named after. But then I asked it for contrasts. The contrasts were great. Talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=454">00:07:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">about how they had different purposes, were made of different materials, etc. Apparently one is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=459">00:07:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">priceless and one is affordable. But the last column I thought of, and of course I could have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=464">00:07:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">carried this on for several more columns, was now add a column for how they would fare if confronted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=471">00:07:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">with the same product. And I thought, well, that's a good idea. And I thought, well, that's a good idea. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=472">00:07:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought, well, that's a good idea.

This wasn't just the chuckle. I was laughing. So in a polar bear encounter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=479">00:07:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">apparently the painting would be ignored by the bear as it's not edible or interesting. The toothpaste,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=485">00:08:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">on the other hand, would be sniffed by the polar bear as it has a strong scent, but it would not be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=490">00:08:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">eaten as it's not nutritious. The icon status apparently of both items would be irrelevant to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=496">00:08:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the polar bear as it does not care about human culture or history. And this one, come on, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=501">00:08:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">funny.

It even clarifies that the active ingredients of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=511">00:08:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the toothpaste would be harmful to the digestive system of the polar bear. Anyway, it is long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=516">00:08:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">since time that I get to the seventh item on the list. And this use case is to get famous figures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=521">00:08:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from history to commentate on current events. For example, I asked, what would Napoleon think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=528">00:08:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">about the deal between OpenAI and Microsoft? And how would that view</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=532">00:08:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">differ from the view of Mahatma Gandhi? Obviously, you can pick any event and any famous person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=537">00:08:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The results were actually quite informative. It summarized their views and then said Napoleon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=543">00:09:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">would have agreed with the deal. He would have thought it was a strategic move to dominate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=547">00:09:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">global market and influence other nations. On the other hand, Gandhi apparently would have had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=552">00:09:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">negative attitude towards the deal, seeing it as a threat to human dignity and freedom through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=557">00:09:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">artificial intelligence. I don't know what you think, but now we know what these figures think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=562">00:09:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, I could have used seven more turns to find out what they think on a range of current</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=567">00:09:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">events. But now it's time for the most overwhelmingly important use case. No, I'm kind of just kidding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=572">00:09:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's absolutely useless. It's kind of interesting. You can use emojis to summarize things. For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=578">00:09:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">example, current events, movies, shows, whatever. Summarize the movie John Wick 3 in emojis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=583">00:09:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And these emojis are pretty accurate to the plot. In Britain, Brexit is always in the news. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=592">00:09:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">think some of these emojis sum up how it's actually going. Anyway, if you like the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weH9LKYNGWg&t=597">00:09:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">eight message limit, let me know in the comments.
