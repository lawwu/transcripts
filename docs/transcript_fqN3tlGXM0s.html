There's outer success, which is wealth and its status. And then there's inner success, which is truly, are you enjoying what you do each day?</p><p>The point of dharma isn't necessarily to shame outside success or to shame the idea of wanting nice things or having a career that is ambitious that other people respect. What it is saying, though, is that we can get all that stuff and still not feel inner success, which is really meaning and a sense of purpose in what we do.</p><p>And at a certain point in time, it can be very easy to be walking a path that doesn't actually feel like your own.</p></div></div></body></html>
