He played for the Baltimore Ravens, who are playing the Steelers right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Ravens organization now admits to a total failure in addressing the situation prior to the release of this video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The football commissioner himself is under fire right now over the timing of when he was made aware of the graphic elevator video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor John, from a creation standpoint, we believe God created men and women distinctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So why do we all know inherently that men are not to mistreat women like this, but to protect and to serve them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this situation, what do complementarian Christians say to Ray Rice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Complementarians have a very special word for Ray Rice and the thousands of men like him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's clarify what we mean by complementarian so that the word will land with understanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Complementarians say that men and women are different in deep and important ways, not just physical and surface ways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that these differences that God has designed for our good have profound influence on the way we relate to each other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and what roles God wants us to take up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the word complementarian, spelled with an E in the middle, not an I, it's not com-ple-mentarianism, but com-ple-mentarian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The word complementarian comes from being complementary to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is, each being a complement to the other, like in ice skating in the Olympics, the moves of the man and the woman ice skater in the doubles complement the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and together make something beautiful to watch that is more than just each of them excelling on their own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This means that complementarians don't think all the roles that are defined for us are based merely on competencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a relationship, you don't just ask who is smarter or more articulate or physically stronger or faster or a better reader or neater and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You ask more significantly and more fundamentally, is the man as man, not just human,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is the man as man created by God with a built-in deep sense, an inclination, a disposition, something deeper than cultural, deeper than societal, deeper than upbringing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a sense of responsibility deep in his soul to nurture and provide for and protect and take life-giving initiatives with the women in his life according to the kinds of relationships that they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Complementarians answer that question, yes, man as man, as God created him, not as sin has distorted us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Man as man created by God senses deep in his masculine soul, it is my special responsibility to show special care for and provide for and protect and be hope-giving and life-enhancing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and woman-ennobling in the initiatives that I take in relation to the women in my life, knowing, yes, knowing that this will look different from one relationship to the other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">say the woman who brings the mail to the house or the bank teller or the woman police officer or his wife or his daughter or his mother.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to look different in all those relationships, but in every relationship, he will know himself to be a man relating to a woman,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and he will shape his relationship according to these deep, caring, protective, honoring, initiative-taking, God-given impulses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So complementarians base all of this on the teachings of the Bible, teachings like number one, husbands, love your wives and don't be harsh with them, Colossians 319.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or number two, husbands, you're the head of your wife as Christ is the head of the church, so lead her graciously, take initiatives the way Christ does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or third, husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He gave himself to protect her. He died to save her, so die to protect your wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or four, no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ does the church, so nourish her and care for her and provide for her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or five, honor your wives as the weaker vessels since they are heirs, fellow heirs with you of the grace of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, don't let the fact that you could take advantage of her by your superiority or strength in any way incline you to abuse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Rather, let it incline you to honor her as a fellow heir of the grace of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, for complementarians, protection and care and vision and nurture and leading with life-giving initiatives are all ways that God has ordained in man's very nature for honoring women as fellow heirs of the grace of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the crucial insight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Men don't become men on their wedding day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They are becoming men from the day that they are conceived as male, which means that all those beautiful burdens and responsibilities laid on men in marriage by the Bible are relevant outside marriage, before marriage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because men are men and women are women outside marriage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These relationships vary, how you play it out varies according to how different the relationships are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But these principles are always relevant, whether the issue is women in combat or women in an elevator alone with a man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the complementarian says to Ray Rice and every other man with any woman anywhere, "Your manhood, as God designed you and as Jesus Christ, the Son of God, can remake you through a faith relationship with him, means conquer your selfish impulses with the realization that real men don't hit women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Real men protect women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Real men don't use women to provide for their appetites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Real men use their strength to provide for the woman's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Real men are not led around by the leash of their own temper, hooked in their nose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Real men master their temper and lead women out of harm, not into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And where men cease to be such men, real men step in and do what needs to be done."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3prNojwtAos&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.000</a></span> | <span
