want to obviously build this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">personal

target="_blank">00:01:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like one component of it and the first thing that I'm going to work on is can it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">help me with like researching papers from archive.</span></div><div class="c"><span

time just kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">of like reading things

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">understand what it's talking about I need to go and read another paper and then to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that I need to go and read another paper and that's fine but I think it would be so useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually just be able to ask a question in like a chat or in like a search bar or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">something and get a answer that kind of takes all of these relevant parts of the research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and summarizes it to me and

target="_blank">00:02:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would be incredibly useful and that's my main focus right now actually building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">this part of it and to some degree it's kind of there so let me just show you what we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">so far with that.</span></div><div

I've already asked and this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">just in a notebook at the moment so there's a ton of code that I've just run in order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to get to this point and then we'll just see a couple of questions just so you can get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a feel for what the idea behind this might look like when it is more kind of fleshed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">out.</span></div><div

portion of data set and of course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not really in a chatbot like format it only has the archive data in there it can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">really do that much right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This is really like the first component of the idea of an AI assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah let's take a look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so now I'm asking something that is kind of in there what is the latest research on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning and acting in language

paper here towards reasoning in large language models a survey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it does straight away like a very it seems like a very useful paper but this is quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of text maybe I don't want to read all this it's not in the best format either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we can do is put them all together and feed them through an OpenAI completion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">endpoint so doing text of entry 003 so we come down here and then this is asking the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">question now and this does take a little bit of time because I have a lot of information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">going into the large language model and small amount coming out but it's you know all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that together is considered by the large language model and based on how much we have it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to take longer or less time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So the latest research on reasoning and acting in language models includes techniques for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">improving and eliciting reasoning

probably referring to things like chain of thought which is true methods</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=293"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's an okay review but it's not very specific.</span></div><div class="c"><span

ask it a question and what it's going to do is first it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of say okay this is your question this is the first step I'm going to take in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">order to find the answer to your question and based on that first step it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">move on to the next step right and

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of notes in here it'd be really good to index all of that code documentation so you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">know like lang chain it's a new library chatgpt doesn't know anything about it so you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ask it questions about it it would be really good to like be able to put that in our long-term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">memory component and then actually we can answer questions about it like super quickly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which will be amazing now what will it look like yeah this lang chain pinecone for storing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">all the archive papers and everything else so one thing I did want to mention this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right now what you just saw all the papers I got for that they've just kind of been brought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in bulk from scraping the archive website and using the archive API and there was no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligent logic behind that what I have started working on and it's kind of you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's getting there is basically you give one paper and then it's going to work through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that paper it's going to extract the references and then it's going to find the other papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that were mentioned in that paper and it's kind of like a graph or a tree that kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">expands out or branches out from that that would be really cool because I think then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you can be a lot more specific on what you're indexing and not just kind of index the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">20 years of archive which would be insane so that would be really cool maybe you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">do a bit of both though I will say like maybe some more recent papers you just kind of get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">them in and index them in bulk right the okay React framework is kind of what I mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">before there's some notes here I didn't actually mean to press that so let's go back to here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is basically okay your chatbot your AI system will be able to search the internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it will be able to use Python to answer questions and all of these kind of like cool crazy things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that'll be really fun to try and then there's also the chain of thought thing so I haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually tested that yet I would like to so that is in there as well and then where are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we at the moment we are still doing step one so it's where we are for now that's all I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">focusing on I think that would still take a little bit of time to build and it's definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take a couple of videos to actually walk you through everything so you know we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be on this for a little while and then we'll move on to trying to make it into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">more of a chatbot we're going to have like the endpoint and a nice like web app like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe I can use angular or something it's like the only framework I've ever used before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if that's even relevant anymore but my idea actually here was to ask chatGPT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to help me build that so that will be interesting to to try out let's see and then finally I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">want it to be in a super easy to use format so you can literally just like git clone it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and use it for your own things so yeah that's where we are at the moment you know for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">video I'm going to leave it there because there's a ton of code it's super messy but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TDwVSpwKc&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I will take you through it in the next video where we're going to focus on actually
