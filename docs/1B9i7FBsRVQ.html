So this talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in a nutshell, if I could sum it up, is all about agentic workflow. So I'm sure some of you here have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">built agents, you're in this track, maybe some of you have not. So I'm going to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with a bit of a level set on agent workflow and agentic workflow, and then I'll show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">how that maps to the agent we built with Minecraft. So this flow diagram is probably familiar to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">some of you, where an agent will take inputs like chat or some unstructured data. It'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">consume that and then it will use a set of tools, one or many tools to satisfy the request</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">from the chat. So it can fulfill its destiny and its actions. And also it uses an LLM and it may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">then orchestrate one or many times through the LLM, the tools, and then return a response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty well understood now, but very cool. So if we take that into a Minecraft world, where does the chat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">come from? Well, if anybody here played Minecraft? A few people, a few people. Great. So if you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">played Minecraft, you'll know there's a chat function where you can interact with the world and other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">people in the world. And so that's where the chat comes for this agent. The tools in Minecraft are many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's why we built this. In Minecraft, you can do many things. You can build, you can dig,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you can farm, you can slay a pig if you so desire, but you can do a few things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the agent itself becomes the bot. So we tell it via chat what we want it to do. It uses the tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and hopefully fulfills our requests. Now, remembering that our requests are probably indeterminate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and the output is also indeterminate. So today I'm going to live demo what you should never do. So they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">say you should never live demo with kids, animals, and an LLM. So I'm going to do that today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The LLM itself, of course, is magic. It is. It's magic. And then the responses, the agent will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do one or many thoughts and then return the response to Minecraft. So that's the flow in a nutshell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, we have our friendly bot. And so our bot's name is Rocky, in short for Bedrock. And we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">see what Rocky, if Rocky behaves today. And the tools we're going to use with Rocky and the actions that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">those tools will jump on is jump, move to position, locate a player, and a few more actions that we've built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And at this stage, I'll also mention that this demo that I'm going to show is open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can all have a play with it. At the end, all you need is a Minecraft client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is Rocky. I'm going to give you a quick recording that I did yesterday at the booth. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at the AWS booth. If you want to come and chat to me, I'm not scary. I am from Australia, but I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">scary. So Rocky does a number of things. So this is what Rocky will look like. At the minute, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">raining in Rocky land. Rocky is a very friendly bot. And so you can ask Rocky questions in the chat. I hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can all see that. So what's the weather? So Rocky being friendly will know my name and then also tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you what the weather's like. So it's really in your area. You might want to take some shelter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Rocky can also do some actions. So this is how we send the actions to the agent via chat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So Rocky jumps for us. Also, Rocky can do other things. So I'm going to hide behind this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Rocky constructed building. And I'm going to ask Rocky, can he come and find me? Or can they come and find me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, Rocky is neither male nor female. Rocky says on my way. And there, there comes Rocky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And Rocky's found us. But what else can Rocky do? So what else did I do here? Oh, it can find things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the world. So Rocky here, I've asked it to find a pig. So Rocky knows based on the plugin that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">using for Minecraft where everything is. And it says, yep, I found a pig. This is the location.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I then ask it, go find, go, go to that pig. So off Rocky runs to the pig and finds the pig.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've made, we've demonstrated this at a lot of conferences. And the biggest thing we've seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is people try to hit the pig. So I asked it to hit the pig. And there it goes. Rocky hits the pig.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do that multiple times. And lots of people have observed do. Don't know why. But hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">human behavior is even more fascinating than LLMs. So now I'm going to get Rocky to come here. And I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">probably finish with the dig action. So I'll ask Rocky to dig a hole. Notice when I say dig a hole,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a parameter that I add. So I think in this instance, yeah, a two by two hole. So this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">parameter that I'm sending to the action. I'll show you how all that works when I do a bit of a deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">dive into the back end. So Rocky's digging a hole. And also Rocky can come find us out of that hole and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">dig their way out of the hole. This is behavior that we didn't expect. And it just, just works,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which is really fascinating. So that's, that's a bit of a three minute demo of Rocky. I'm going to live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">demo Rocky once I go through how I built it. So the architecture. So we built this for a serverless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">conference. So our constraints where needs to run in a managed environment, a service environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and be cool. So we started off with running it in the container. So Minecraft, you can run in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">container. And you can also run mine flare, which is the bot framework that works with Minecraft. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">those two run side by side nicely on the container. We can't run mine flare on Lambda, which is serverless,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because we need state, right? So the state is stored in mine flare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We started off with LangChain on Lambda to build this. Like most people, when they do start building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">agents, they probably start with LangChain. I'm not a big Python developer. I am an engineer, but not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">really with Python. But we got it working to a state. But then as we added complexity and more and more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actions and tools for Rocky to use, it got really, really complex. And then we also used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon SageMaker to host the LLM, which in this case, we were using the Cohere LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we decided, okay, so that's not service enough. Let's use agents for Amazon Bedrock,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">keep the Minecraft server and client, which is MindFlare on Amazon ECS, and build that agent up on Amazon Bedrock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then for architecture. So what we're doing and what I'm demonstrating today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's running on my local machine. So both Minecraft and the MindFlare client. And then it's into calling out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">agents for Amazon Bedrock and may the internet always be favorable over the next couple of minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you haven't come across agents for Amazon Bedrock, let me do a quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">overview. Again, AWS booth is there. Come talk to me. I'll go a deep dive for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But in a nutshell, Amazon Bedrock is all about facading one or more models. So what it does is it produces a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">common API that then you can use as an engineer to build out your application and add features. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we host as well as Amazon models, we host Anthropic models, we host Cahere models, as I mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Lama models, and a whole host of other models. So when building out Rocky now using agents for Amazon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Bedrock, you'll see that I used the Claude models. And I'll go through that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Why I did that, in particular Claude Haiku, because it's fast. And so as well as hosting models, not hosting models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but providing a facade into models, everything, you can also build additions to that. And one of those additions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is agents, as well as knowledge bases, where you can do RAG, and also guardrails and evals. So all of these things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">baked into Amazon Bedrock. And it's think of it more as sort of a managed agentic workflow, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you can manage RAG and manage agents as well. So it's all in one spot. So it also helps you with prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">creation. It's obviously, as it's an agent, orchestrates multiple tasks, and also allows you to trace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">through the chain of thought of the agent. So you can either do that in the console, or we'll spit it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">out to logs. And of course, it also, and what was very key for this demo, it has return of control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that's the slides. Let's jump into what we've got.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me see if I can just, instead of doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Mirror. Nope, not that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, dear. Still mirroring. Okay, there's always, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Me and display. Extend the display. Me and display, I want to mirror. That's not, that's not letting me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Apologies. You got this. You got this. I got this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And mirror.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Mirror. There we go. Yay. Okay, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so this is, that's MindFlare. So it's all open source. Let's first of all start with the good stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So open source, MindFlare, you can use. And then this is the, what we've built. Now I'll share this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at the end, QR code, everything. Don't worry about it. So this is Amazon Bedrock. So this is the agents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is the, the console page. So what it'll do, you can go down here into agents. If you haven't seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Bedrock before, it'll show you the model access and what models you've got access to. But I'm really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about agents, which is down here in the left. So here I've got a Minecraft agent. Apologies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if you can't see this too well. Let me see if I can make it a little bit better. You've got Minecraft,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the Minecraft agent. So I've defined this in here. Now, for all the real engineers in the room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have to build it by click ops. So you can build it all as infrastructure as code. And if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">check out the GitHub repo, you will see it all in CloudFormation and CDK. So once I've got into the agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see that here I can select my model. So at the minute, this agent is using Cloud,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cloud3 Haiku. And here is the prompt. This is the system prompt for that agent. You're a playful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">friendly and creative Minecraft agent called Rocky. And your goal is to entertain players and collaborate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with them in a fun gaming experience. And it goes on. So this prompt we built over time. There's a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of prompt engineering going on in this demo. And then if I go into the actions, you can see all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the actions. So you notice all of the actions that are defined all have returned control because we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">them to return their output. So we've got jump. We've got other actions. Dig. Dig, you'll see this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where the parameters come in. So I've got a depth and a width. So you remember when I specified a hole,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I said two by two. Also, if I say small hole, it will go as a one by one hole. So I'll infer that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">using the model. Also, there's the action. Is it raining? So all of these actions are defined in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, I've got another action set that I'm going to share with you. I'm going to demo is called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Minecraft experimental, right? And what this does, this has one action called build, which is a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">complex thing to do in Minecraft, believe it or not, because it's a 3D space. And so the action for build,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all I do is build a structure. And that returns back to the client. And I'll show you how that prompts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">actually created when I do the build. So that's how it's built. And the actual source code itself is here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the client is stopped. So I'm going to -- this is Rocky itself. So I'm going to start Rocky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Going to start. And bot spawned. Going to go over to Minecraft. We've got running here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Back to game. Rocky's joined the game. There's Rocky. Let me just go set. Time. Time. It's time set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Time. Set. Noon. So you can see it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Okay. So there's Rocky. So you can -- let's just test if Rocky's working. So T, please come here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Rocky will make the first request. And there we go. So Rocky is working for us. So let's make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Rocky can do something. So we go, "Rocky, please, please dig a small, small hole." Okay. So Rocky will dig a small hole.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I'm going to use the experimental feature, which is build. What do you want Rocky to build?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The Colosseum. What? The Colosseum? Okay. I can't even spell that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Something that I can spell, please.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">A double-decker couch. Okay. I like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Please come here. So yesterday I built a rocket ship, which is quite interesting. But a double-decker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">couch. So let's get Rocky out of the hole. So let's give it some space. Okay, Rocky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Please build -- can I just say couch? Double -- let's try it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Never do live. Double-decker couch. Please build double-decker couch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">A. One. Just one. I'm just going to -- I'm just going to make it -- so what happens, Rocky?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Then that prompt goes off. And so if I look at the code, which I've lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So there's the prompt. So what we've done, we've said to Rocky, "You're a Claude,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">an expert Minecraft builder creating by Anthropic. When given a structure description,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which will be the input, then output valid JSON. So this JSON is how MindFlare builds objects. So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">give that as part of the prompt so that the model will understand how to build Minecraft objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you'll go strictly adhere to the following rules. Because if we didn't do that, it goes bananas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and builds just nonsense. And so all blocks are placed to each other. These are the blocks you can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it responds with what it thinks a couch looks like. So this is the XY coordinates. And so it started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the build. So let's see what Rocky's doing. And there, Rocky has built a double-decker couch. Thank you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">very much. I'm going to sit on the couch. So this obviously is the interpretation of what a double-decker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">couch looks like to Claude. And in the 3D space. And then it's been interpreted into XY coordinates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And Rocky has built it. So that is Rocky. Obviously we are here at the AWS booth all day. Could you please,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I also put a QR code, I promised before. Let's fly to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9i7FBsRVQ&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So scan the QR code.
