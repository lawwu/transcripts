href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">as humans, we tend to not really understand how different animal species can be from

And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have this, the vision, their visual field is really big, so they can sort of see what's happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">back there.

So we tend to separate them quite early from their mum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">even though in the wild they would stay for a very long time. So I think some of the concerns that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">have as an ethologist with how we raise horses is the, the, the early weaning that we sometimes see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and also single housing for a species that's, um, an aggregating species. And also that they,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, in the wild they will forage up to 16 hours a day. And when we bring them into captivity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we typically feed them in the way that promotes very quick eating, you know, for just a fraction of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">time. And that can then lead to problem behavior. So, so for me, I think the horses are probably one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the captive animal species where for many individual horses, the type of life that we're offering is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">really not that great.

Is it true that certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">dogs rely on their sense of smell far more than others? And if so, um, do the ones that rely on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">their, on their nose, uh, just not pay attention to what they're looking at unless you insist? I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that the other version of this question is how should we interact with dogs differently depending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on what breed of dog they are?

However, um, how to interact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with different dog breeds. I think that's really a really interesting question because, so during the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">process of domestication and, and in just the last couple of hundred years, really, we started selecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for different capabilities in the different dog, um, dogs that, that we needed for different tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially. So if we look at a wolf hunting sequence, what they'll do is they'll do an orient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">response where they, they sniff and they, they're sort of looking for a, uh, prey and then they will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do some eyeing and stalking behavior. So they'll focus and they'll do stalking and then they'll do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">chasing and then they'll do a grab bite, a killing bite, then they'll dissect and then they'll eat the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">prey. So we have this whole predatory sequence that we see in wolves. And what happened during the process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of domestication was that we sort of selected for certain aspects of that sequence in different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">breeds. So we'll have the, the sniffers, the hounds that are really great. And I, I guess maybe that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">answers your first question. I think that probably all dog breeds enjoy sniffing. It's one of the big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things that people are exploring a lot now is, is nose work. But anyway, back to, to the, this process of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">domestication that, and then we had the, um, uh, the, the pointers who are, who sort of, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really, uh, uh, selected for that behavior, you know, that in, in, in a, in a litter of puppies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we would select the one that was the most prone to do that behavior. And so over generations, we really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">um, sculpted that, that, uh, niche, so to speak.

It's people who care about the bulldog breed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and bringing some more humane breeding practices to the bulldog, because it's a pretty brutal breed now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have tried to reestablish the original line, which again, were elbows back, no strong underbite,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to what you see now. So that's the sort of brief history on the bulldog. They have to be born</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">by cesarean, because big shoulders, small hips. Anyway, the interesting thing about the bulldog, I always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">said, and this will take us back to behavior, was the contract that I felt I had with my bulldog was one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">he would protect me to the death. You do notice that anytime they hear a noise or anything, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hypervigilant. But if there's no impending threat, total relaxation. The most efficient use of energy of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">any species. So basically it was, I'll die for you, Andrew, but unless your life is in danger, I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do anything. So maybe we could talk about temperament in dogs, and how they experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">their emotional life. I don't know if we can make general statements about this, but you've spent a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of your time thinking about the emotional life of animals. What does a dog need in order to feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">calm and safe? Great question. Yeah. So in order to feel calm and safe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we, perhaps we should go to the core effect space, which I think is one of the three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">emotional models that I find very, very useful in understanding and providing like a good environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for animals so that they can thrive really. So the core effect space is one way of depicting or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">conceptualizing emotions where we have like valence on the x-axis. So how pleasant or unpleasant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">something is, and we have arousal on the y-axis. So what you're asking is how can we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">make animals, and I'm not just, not just dogs, but any species, how can we put them in quadrant two of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that core effect space, essentially. So low arousal and pleasant. So where they're relaxed and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">feeling safe and they're sort of engaging socially with others and being sort of at ease, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do we get there? And I think that some of the things to consider is then the absence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of negative emotions. So if, again, if we're in the core effect space in the quadrant four,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with the high arousal unpleasant states, we'll find things like fear, aggression. So helping reduce that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">will sort of automatically help animals move to the right in the matrix. And in the lower quadrant three,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with the unpleasant low arousal state, where animals tend to end up with their sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bored or depressed, is engaging them, providing an environment that's stimulating that they can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of do interesting things in to help them move into the right side of the core effect space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And also to the top in that quadrant one is the high arousal pleasant state. But that would be like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">seeking or foraging behavior, exploration, play, sex. But as to your question, how do we get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">quadrant two with feeling safe and sort of that warm, fuzzy feeling?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of the things to do might be to, if the animal enjoys it coming from you, and they often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have to know you in order to really appreciate it, is like tactile stimulation, so petting, essentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Something that might interfere is that we primates, we humans are primates and we're huggers. We tend to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of go like this when we want to interact with an animal that we really like. And to many animals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this is restraint and really scary. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the type of body contact with that we offer to animals that we should consider whether they really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">enjoy it or not, whether they tolerate it or enjoy it. And one way of doing that is to offer a consent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">test. So you might, you might offer your hand and scratch a little bit, ideally in a place that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">animal really enjoys. So most dogs don't enjoy having a hand on top of their head, but rather,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps here, or the upper chest sort of, yeah. So you might do that for a few seconds and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you remove your hand to see, does the animal enjoy this? And will they then re-initiate that contact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or not? Or will they move away? And I have, I have this issue with my cat now that he is not very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he doesn't sort of enjoy petting as much as I do petting him. So I have to be really mindful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that I, I really offer him the chance to say, no, thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we might consider just touching the animal as a, you calling it a consent test, like as a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as a test. And then if they move toward you, then what is the pattern of, of tactile stimulation that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that dogs like? I've been reading up on this a little bit and somebody ran an experiment that I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is kind of interesting describing the differences between rates of petting. And it basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the conclusion was that essentially they claim that all dogs are averse to very rapid touch and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but that people tend to pat quickly, pet quickly. And they, they showed a beautiful example of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just, just if one just deliberately strokes the animal very slowly, the animal's eyelids just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">start to hood. And you basically just, um, diffuse the tension very quickly, which I think is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting that, you know, as humans, we think, oh, we want to pat the dog on its head. And for some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">reason we associate patting with fast patting or petting as a, as a quick process, you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">scratch and pet this animal where it very well could be that all the dogs out there are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">dying for some really nice, slow strokes. Yeah. And I also think that that nice, slow stroke,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're sort of in a calm emotional state yourself, then we might tap into another interesting, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">emotion theory, which is the polyvagal theory and this concept of co-regulation. So if you're really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">calm and relaxed, then you're sort of sending out these cues, these, um, uh, subtle cues that other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">individuals are reading and picking up on. And it seems that we do that with vis-a-vis also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">our dogs and, uh, certainly also horses, it seems so that just being calm and relaxed yourself can really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">help relax the dog. And what you say about the fast petting or patting really makes sense to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there's one study in horses that show that, that if you pat a horse, many horses find that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">aversive. So in other words, it's something that they'll work to avoid. And yet that is often how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">try to reward them when they do something that we want. They do enjoy wither scratching. So back at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">nape of the, um, the mane, if you scratch them there, they'll typically enjoy that. But I would say that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that, um, different animals, different individuals will have these individual preferences and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to see what they like. And perhaps also if you, if you offering your hands like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they might even scoot around to show you which body part they want scratched once they learn this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this, this, the, the rules of that communication.

I don't have any, uh, you know, stake in this. I just would like to learn and I would like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">people to learn so that they can have better interactions with, with and for animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.

So first of all, I think that, that actually, we often do walk up to strange</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">dogs that we never met before. We're like, hi, can I pet him? And then we start patting on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on top of the animal's head.

And then this whole discussion about dominance is really interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because as an ethologist, how we define dominance is completely different from how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">most people define it.

And I find that there's two, like two lines of that definition. So one is the ethological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">definition of dominance and one is the sociological definition of dominance. And I think that what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">doing often is that we're misusing, we're, we're using the sociological definition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on animals, um, in a way that's, I think, unfortunate because the ethological definition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is about priority of access to resources. Here's a resource. Here's like five individuals coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">up to it.

The others simply have to wait or look elsewhere. Uh, and this reduces the risk of sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">confrontation and aggression and all the costs associated with that. So it's, it's just, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">normal that animals who hang out together, who are like in a stable social group will organize or,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or have some sort of, uh, dominance hierarchy within them that, that allows this to take place,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to reduce the risk, the risk of aggression.

Okay. There's dominance among dogs or among dogs and other non-human animals. I'm thinking in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of the relationship between human and dog, um, and touch and space. You know, I've heard that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">um, the dog touches you. It thinks it owns you. I've heard that if you move into a space,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">um, that the dog is and it backs away, then it's, uh, you know, it thinks of you as dominant. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I've also heard that if the dog moves into your space very quickly, that it sees itself as kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of the leader in this relationship. There are a lot of theories out there about this. And I'm realizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that all these theories about animals, um, must be very contentious because, um, they lack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">lack the language to tell us what we want to know. And so we're, we're always sort of guessing when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we're doing ethology. I would not label any of those situations that you described as a dominance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">interaction, actually. I would rather, if the dog backs away when you confront them, I would sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">rather label that as perhaps a fearful reaction, uh, not submissive as in giving you priority of access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to a resource.

And that, that might shift depending on what the resource is. So it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's, it's written in stone or anything.

And when I, as an ethologist say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">leader, I mean the one that leads that, that sort of work walks first in line from one location to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">another.

Um, and there's other social roles as well. There</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">might be the controller who is the animal who tends to initiate, um, a change in activity. So we see this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in cows, for instance, that all the cows are standing up and they're, they're grazing. And then one cow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the controller lies down and everybody else lies down also and they start ruminating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They will often synchronize their behavior, but they'll follow.

Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">um, it's interesting to kind of interpret that as a question, which is if the dog walks in front,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">does it mean that it somehow is the leader?

I think that we, we carry a lot of, and actually I, we haven't mentioned this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, but I, I have very little practical experience about dogs with dogs.

Uh, and, and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">same cats tend to look at the world from the, the left when in a negative emotional state and from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">right when in a positive emotional state.

So studies have shown that, that we humans are actually, um, we learn to read dogs by exposure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2480" target="_blank">00:41:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">even passive exposure, just living in an environment.

Um, M-A-A is for activity shift. So we'll see different behaviors. They might be chasing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they might be pouncing, they might be wrestling, biting each other.

So in order to keep playing, the bigger dog needs to lose sometimes. So they,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they need to, in order to, to keep this interaction going, uh, that's the way to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last one, S is self-handicap.

No, no. From what I know, cats will sort of bring back what they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">catch to a place where they feel safe.

Many cats don't do that. They only have the crab bites. So they'll,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll just let the, the little rhodod go to run off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen that.

So, so they'll let it go. And if the mouse is still, they can actually just sort of escape</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">attention because the animal, the cat might grow bored and walk away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3733" target="_blank">01:02:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But the moment they start moving again, then they're sort of restarting that whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">predatory sequence again. But back to your question about how to interact with cats or whether,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how to read them. So that would be the third thing that I'm looking at is how do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3749" target="_blank">01:02:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the animal species in front of me, how do they respond to perceived threat? And I'm saying perceived</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">threat here because sometimes we are well-intended. We're like, hi. And we want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to hug them because we're primates. And they really don't like that. So, so they will respond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to us as if we were a predator. And I think that, again, comes down very much to the types of interaction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">social interactions, the type of learning that the, the animal has had when they're really young. So for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">instance, there's a study showing that if you handle young kittens between the ages of like two and eight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3790" target="_blank">01:03:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks for at least an hour a day, and, and when I say handle, I just mean that sort of interact with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">them and, and play and have them sort of on your lap and so on, they will become very social as adults.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they will be the type of cat that will jump up into your lap and fall asleep purring. If you interact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with that young kitten less than like 15 minutes a day, they won't be fearful of humans, but they'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3817" target="_blank">01:03:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">be more like walking up to you and saying hi, and then walking away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so I think that early life experiences can really shape the type of temperament,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3831" target="_blank">01:03:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if you will, or how sort of vigorously animals respond to changes in the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3837" target="_blank">01:03:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What is this behavior of bumping, uh, where the cat bumps its head against you or your arm? Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3845" target="_blank">01:04:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is it to, um, spread smell? Yeah, I would say that is scent marking. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and when they're scent marking you, why are they scent marking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I would think that it's, it's like something you do in your group, you do mutual scent marking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3860" target="_blank">01:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which means that everybody in the group smells more or less the same. So it's a, it's a way of sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">greeting and incorporating the others in the group. So there'll be a lot of scent exchange within,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, this type of species living in the group. That would be my guess as to why they do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So is scent marking about territory as well? Like if a cat, you know, scent marks in corners and-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3884" target="_blank">01:04:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah. They, but that's a different, that's typically not the, because they have like multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">scent glands in the face that are, and, and one of them is used to scent mark sort of the inner territory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3898" target="_blank">01:04:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where they feel really safe. And then they usually have this urine scent marking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3903" target="_blank">01:05:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which is in the out sort of, um, the outskirts of the territory. And you, you might see this if you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">if for instance, you have an indoor cat and they start peeing and you bring out a piece of paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3916" target="_blank">01:05:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and a layout of your, um, your house or apartment and you start sort of putting a little ring to where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you find the, the pee, that will give you a lot of information because if, if it's a territorial thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it will typically be at the edges of sort of at the windows or doors. If it's a, an elimination problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3938" target="_blank">01:05:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that the cat has sort of maybe perhaps, uh, it hurts when he pees. So then he learns to associate pain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">with going in the box. And so the box starts representing painful experiences. So he will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">start going outside of the box, but that type of behavior will be seen in that context instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. Um, so if your cat is urinating inside, you know, have a, an experiment to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3963" target="_blank">01:06:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The use of a litter box is a pretty interesting one to me. It's not what I spent a lot of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3969" target="_blank">01:06:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about, but if you sort of step back and you say, okay, here's this animal that we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3973" target="_blank">01:06:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">domesticated and it readily learns how to cover its waste.

That's basically the two different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">strategies there.

Is that something in cats, is that a natural behavior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4002" target="_blank">01:06:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they do in the wild? And if they roam, why do they bother? Is it, um, and then sort of tack to this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is that with dogs, oftentimes after they eliminate waste, they'll step away from it and kick dirt in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the general direction. And I've heard it interpreted two ways. One is that they're trying to spread scent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4021" target="_blank">01:07:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and the other is that they're trying to cover waste. So again, uh, this is why I was interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4026" target="_blank">01:07:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to an animal ethologist as opposed to a pet, uh, behavioral trainer, right? I'm also interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in that, but, but I think we have to again, acknowledge that much of the interpretation that we have about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">animals behavior is just human interpretation. So certainly. So what is this, uh, covering of waste?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we know what it's for in the wild in cats? The covering of waste, um, is a way to sort of reduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4051" target="_blank">01:07:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the risk of infection.

You know, as, as a scientist and someone who loves dogs and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4132" target="_blank">01:08:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">loved him, you know, more than words, I just was like, this is amazing.

And he's also reading the pee mail from the other dogs that are in the neighborhood. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4143" target="_blank">01:09:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">urine tells a lot of information to the other animal.

So it's, and they spend a lot of time doing it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4164" target="_blank">01:09:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they're willing to work to get access to that, uh, opportunity.

I'm not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4197" target="_blank">01:09:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not, I'm not being facetious.

We have neural real estate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4214" target="_blank">01:10:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for smelling and certainly for touch.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty striking. Yeah. So dogs descended from, they were domesticated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4248" target="_blank">01:10:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from wolves correctly.

So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4273" target="_blank">01:11:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so it was, it was, it wasn't that we caught wolves and said, aha, I'm going to breed you now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4278" target="_blank">01:11:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but it was rather that that was, it was like a symbiotic relationship that developed over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4285" target="_blank">01:11:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.

But that's different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4294" target="_blank">01:11:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because, you know, I see these Instagram videos of like an otter jumping on a kayak and there's some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4300" target="_blank">01:11:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">interaction, uh, that's regular, you know, that the person goes out on their kayak, they interact with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4306" target="_blank">01:11:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this otter.

It just sounds like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4311" target="_blank">01:11:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">food payoff is, is, and safety is really the key.

And what does that tell us about zoos? I personally have a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4325" target="_blank">01:12:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, pretty strong, um, visceral reaction to zoos that, um, have large carnivores. Uh, I realized we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4335" target="_blank">01:12:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">could have a discussion about elephants too, but I feel like large carnivores housed in zoos creates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4340" target="_blank">01:12:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some issues for me. I won't go into what this is, but, but I'm also here that zoos have, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">positive, uh, breeding programs, uh, endangered species protection programs. Uh, what's your take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4353" target="_blank">01:12:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on zoos? When we talk about zoos, it's perhaps good to talk about the evolution of zoos because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4358" target="_blank">01:12:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">back in the day, like 150 years ago, it used to be more or less a menagerie that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4364" target="_blank">01:12:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">here's a lion and here's an elephant and here's a zebra.

So there's, there's, um, what's referred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4383" target="_blank">01:13:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to as in situ conservation, where you work to preserve wild habitats and creating national parks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4390" target="_blank">01:13:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera, and sort of giving the opportunities for, for reintroduction of species and so on. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4396" target="_blank">01:13:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there's ex situ conservation, which is then housing those, uh, animal species that are, are threatened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=4402" target="_blank">01:13:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with extinction in an environment.

Um, and then, uh, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5043" target="_blank">01:24:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">foraging behaviors, where am I going to get my next meal?

We're thinking like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5048" target="_blank">01:24:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we, we think that we're doing them a service, like here's, here's your food on the plate.

They live a very long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5100" target="_blank">01:25:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">time. Oh.

Um, anyway, um, it's interesting to think about this need for animals to express their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5126" target="_blank">01:25:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">natural repertoire of behaviors for dog owners. Um, I think that the common practice is to, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5133" target="_blank">01:25:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">put out a bowl of food, uh, would we be better off bringing the food to a park and, and going to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5138" target="_blank">01:25:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">park and then having them eat there? Um, or somehow incorporating the, the, the roaming and, and, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5146" target="_blank">01:25:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">prey seeking, uh, behavior. I mean, how would one incorporate that into a more, uh, pleasant experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5152" target="_blank">01:25:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for, for the dog? Because what you're saying makes total sense that they need to express these behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5156" target="_blank">01:25:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not, if they're, if they can't, um, um, it's going to come out some other way and maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5161" target="_blank">01:26:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the destructive to them or the environment. Yeah. Essentially, I think that for dog owners,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5165" target="_blank">01:26:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that what we can do is we can try to promote the different aspects of the predatory sequence that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5172" target="_blank">01:26:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that particular dog in front of us enjoys doing. Uh, I, I mentioned nose work as being one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5179" target="_blank">01:26:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">things that, that many dogs really enjoy. And interestingly, and this is, this is just sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5184" target="_blank">01:26:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of the early days of scientific studies on the effects of nose work, uh, are really promising</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5189" target="_blank">01:26:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that, that one of the effects of nose work seems to be. So if you, if you're not familiar with it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5194" target="_blank">01:26:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's essentially that the animal has learned that he needs to find a specific scent in an area. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5202" target="_blank">01:26:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">he sniffs the area, he roams the area and he follows the scent and he'll, he'll stop and mark when he finds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5207" target="_blank">01:26:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the scent and then he gets a reinforcer. So he gets rewarded for, for doing that. So that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5211" target="_blank">01:26:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that's, that's essentially more or less a setup. And it seems that it helps regulate arousal so that animals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5218" target="_blank">01:26:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">who are sort of highly strong and almost, uh, um, have generalized anxiety get calmed down. And the ones</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5226" target="_blank">01:27:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that are sort of, uh, semi-depressed get, um, sort of, uh, more, um, more enthusiastic about life. And, and also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5237" target="_blank">01:27:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and, um, if we're back in core effect space, again, we have this shift to the right-hand side of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5242" target="_blank">01:27:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the core effect space. So we have positive valence associated with that. Uh, and it seems really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5247" target="_blank">01:27:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting, um, early days still, because this, this, um, dog sport is like just, I don't know, 15 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5255" target="_blank">01:27:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">old or something. It's not very, not very old. So essentially what we can do is we can, um, every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5262" target="_blank">01:27:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">dog could do nose work. I think that would be an interesting sort of an outlet for that very first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5268" target="_blank">01:27:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the behavior sequence. And then I know that some, some, um, um, trainers are working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5274" target="_blank">01:27:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically to, to help dogs who chase wildlife, for instance. And it's about teaching the dog to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5283" target="_blank">01:28:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">stay in the first parts of the predatory sequence, to do the sniffing, the, the, uh, the pointing and the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5291" target="_blank">01:28:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">um, the, um, the eyeing behavior and then getting reinforced for that so many times so that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5298" target="_blank">01:28:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">becomes like a feedback loop that they, they see a, they see a deer running across the road and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5303" target="_blank">01:28:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">go, mom, I saw a deer and they get reinforced for that. So, and other dogs like greyhounds that love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5310" target="_blank">01:28:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">chasing that you allow them to do that. And then, uh, other dogs that really allow sort of, uh, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5317" target="_blank">01:28:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that really enjoy, uh, carrying things that you allow them to do that. And then give your poodle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5324" target="_blank">01:28:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, an old, um, something to rip apart, you know, and disembowel things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5331" target="_blank">01:28:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Poodles like to, to, to kill and to, to, to, to the post kill ripping apart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5335" target="_blank">01:28:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Rip them apart. Gosh, the, the name and the look of a poodle suggests a much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5339" target="_blank">01:28:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a much more docile animal. So they really like to rip bodies apart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5343" target="_blank">01:29:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. As far as I understand. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5345" target="_blank">01:29:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that makes sense. Um, given what I understand about the dosing of different genes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5348" target="_blank">01:29:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also I would, you know, rather than serving food on the plate, you might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5352" target="_blank">01:29:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">try scatter feeding. So just, uh, or, or feeding it in a way that the animal actually has to work for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5358" target="_blank">01:29:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So do some behavior like, um, one of these snuffle mats, you hide the food in there. So they have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5364" target="_blank">01:29:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually spend some time looking for the food before consuming it. Because otherwise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5370" target="_blank">01:29:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">if you serve it in a bowl, the animal, some animals simply, you know, they inhale it. It takes like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5374" target="_blank">01:29:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">30 seconds and they're done. Costello ate like a seagull. Yeah. Yeah. Really. He wouldn't chew his food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5380" target="_blank">01:29:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It's interesting. The, um, the, the dog food, uh, training, uh, animal health world sells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5387" target="_blank">01:29:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of things where you can put food inside of an object where they have to really work hard at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5391" target="_blank">01:29:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I had mixed, uh, you know, sort of mixed results with that because I, I, I have heard that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5398" target="_blank">01:29:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in addition to exercise and wanting your proximity that animals, dogs in particular, perhaps really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5405" target="_blank">01:30:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">need that cognitive work that they, they get bored and they really need the challenge of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5412" target="_blank">01:30:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of, of working their mind so much so that on rainy days, when you like, if weather's really bad and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5418" target="_blank">01:30:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't go out that they need an immense amount of kind of like search and forage type behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5423" target="_blank">01:30:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would, I, I strive to do that. Um, and I know some people might hear this and just think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5428" target="_blank">01:30:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is crazy. Like my dog just wants to curl up at my feet and it just wants to fetch the ball,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5432" target="_blank">01:30:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's for fetching breeds. If I threw a ball to Costello, he would go to it and then just sit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5438" target="_blank">01:30:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on top of it. He had no interest whatsoever in doing anything with that in terms of retrieving it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5443" target="_blank">01:30:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5444" target="_blank">01:30:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But he would love to just love to tug. So just, you know, if I tied a, a rope to a tree, for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5450" target="_blank">01:30:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">he would jump on, on there and hold on. And I could swing him by his body way to, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5455" target="_blank">01:30:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">90 pounds and he'd stay up there for 10 minutes. Yeah. Like the, the pleasure of chewing was clearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5461" target="_blank">01:31:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the strongest innate drive. So I think what I'm realizing is that understanding the sequence of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5466" target="_blank">01:31:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">natural behaviors, but also where in that sequence, a particular breed really leans to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=5470" target="_blank">01:31:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

That's filial imprinting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6041" target="_blank">01:40:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are two types.

They grow attachment bonds to humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6063" target="_blank">01:41:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the difference?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6064" target="_blank">01:41:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So imprinting is typically a very fast process. It occurs within, you know, minutes or hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6070" target="_blank">01:41:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Attachment takes longer and involves more senses.

So this bond that grows between, uh, caregiver and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6088" target="_blank">01:41:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">offspring. Um, what's interesting also is that, that attachment bond, um, will grow in different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6097" target="_blank">01:41:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">ways depending on how the caregiver responds to the young one's, um, needs, um, needs essentially. So you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6106" target="_blank">01:41:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">have, um, a secure attachment bond where the caregiver is very, uh, reliably responds to the needs of the, of the young</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6116" target="_blank">01:41:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">one. So that if they find themselves alone, they can, they can self-regulate better. So they can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6125" target="_blank">01:42:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">their nervous system can more easily calm down again, uh, after a stressor than if they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6133" target="_blank">01:42:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">insecurely attached.

So it's, it's like very cultural whether neutering is something that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6772" target="_blank">01:52:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">do or not in, in, in any given location. That's one. The second thing is that you said that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6780" target="_blank">01:53:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">neutering is about removing test, uh, testicles. Actually there's, there's other procedures that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6786" target="_blank">01:53:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">can be done, which is, is essentially, uh, just snipping the connection. So not removing testicles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6793" target="_blank">01:53:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so that they continue producing, uh, all the stuff that they produce, but they, um, uh, they can't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6803" target="_blank">01:53:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, produce, reproduce sexually.

There's also this interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6834" target="_blank">01:53:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that the, the, the, the knowledge of the effects of castration or, or neutering has really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6841" target="_blank">01:54:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">changed a lot in the last 20 years or so. It used to be in the 1990s that, that it used to be recommended</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6849" target="_blank">01:54:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">because, uh, you know, they wouldn't reproduce and there'd be less, uh, humping and, and, and some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6855" target="_blank">01:54:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, so it was sort of promoted with regards to certain behavioral changes. Later studies have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6864" target="_blank">01:54:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">shown, and there's like more than 20 in the last 20 years or so, have shown that quite consistently that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6869" target="_blank">01:54:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the effects of neutering might be particularly in males, apparently. And it depends on the age at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6876" target="_blank">01:54:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">which this is done also. And it has to do with this, the activation process, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6881" target="_blank">01:54:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">is that you see an increase in fear, uh, an increase in, in reactivity, aggressive behavior. You might see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6890" target="_blank">01:54:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">an increase in, um, uh, noise, uh, sensitivity and so on. So it seems that as you were touching on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6901" target="_blank">01:55:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the change in hormonal status not only has this physiology, the physical effects on the body,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6907" target="_blank">01:55:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but also behavioral effects.

So to me, it's very interesting that in Norway, dogs are not allowed to be fixed except</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6945" target="_blank">01:55:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">for medical reasons in Australia. They have to be at least in Western Australia. Um, so this idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6952" target="_blank">01:55:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">keeping dogs intact, so to speak, um, is not such a heretical one. Um, but I think in the United States,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6960" target="_blank">01:56:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of this is still getting worked out. And I think that the statistics say that the number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6965" target="_blank">01:56:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people with pets in the home now in the United States is, is like almost every home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6969" target="_blank">01:56:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think it's a 40% of Americans own a dog. And I think in Norway, it's like 15. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6977" target="_blank">01:56:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think probably this ties in a lot to why the cultures have emerged so differently because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6984" target="_blank">01:56:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot less sort of backyard breeding and so on and, and feral populations in Scandinavia of dogs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=6992" target="_blank">01:56:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't have this huge problem with overpopulation, um, uh, that you'll see in some other countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=7000" target="_blank">01:56:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and I think that, that here, a lot of the, the neutering is done to control the population, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=7008" target="_blank">01:56:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">predominantly as a way to sort of try to reduce the number of animals, uh, sort of go into shelters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=7015" target="_blank">01:56:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=7016" target="_blank">01:56:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly there are a lot of dogs in shelters now during the pandemic, people were adopting them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=7020" target="_blank">01:57:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like crazy.

And that relates to humans as animals.

Uh, so, um, yeah, that would be, I guess, my reflect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ck9fa6_C8c&t=7228" target="_blank">02:00:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">my first spontaneous reflection to your question.
