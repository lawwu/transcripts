And if you're going to like digitize processes and automate them and stuff, you have to capture all that complexity basically at the bit level. And that's extremely difficult. So you just have to write like more and more code basically.</p><p>And so that's why we don't see like runaway productivity growth from software is because we're fighting, you know, all this increasing complexity. Have you heard of the water vet theory of complexity, by the way? I don't think so. There's like a fixed amount of complexity in a system. And if you try to reduce it, what you'll end up doing is just, you'll end up migrating the complexity elsewhere, right?</p><p>As your program grows, that complexity exponentially grows of all the things that could go wrong when you're making two things interact that are in a way that you, you were expecting not to. So yeah, the, the idea is you can just choose where to have your complexity, but you can't get rid of that complexity.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's arguably now creating software is actually the most complex thing we do.</p></div></div></body></html>
