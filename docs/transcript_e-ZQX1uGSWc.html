Dharma has been called many different things. You'll find different definitions, but my grandfather called that your essence, right? We all have an essence.</p><p>And the question is, are we expressing that? And this is where I got it wrong for a lot of years, which is I always assumed that essence equals job. Essence equals job title. So my essence is to be a programmer. My essence is to be a product manager or to be a lawyer.</p><p>Those are occupations, but they're not an essence. An essence, it's deeper than that. It's I enjoy helping people. I enjoy designing things from scratch. I enjoy assembling products or growing other people's careers. And the idea is that when you can come back to that essence, it opens up a universe of possibilities because there are always multiple ways to express that essence.</p></div></div></body></html>
