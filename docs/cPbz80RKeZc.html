target="_blank">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But no idea of financial journalism or financial writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I should say when I went to college, which was back in the mid-'70s,</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Wall Street was just something that all guys in gray suits did, and we didn't pay much attention to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I got a series of jobs with small papers just because I wanted to break out into something more interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I went down to South America and I was working for a terrific paper in Caracas, Venezuela,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

stringing for The Wall Street Journal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">Because Venezuela had a lot of oil production and was interesting to Wall Street and to its readers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I discovered there that there was budget stories and that economic stories could be fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And through the medium of the journal, I realized that there was real interest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you could get to a lot of facts and also a lot of interesting stories through economic journalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And after about two years, I was ready to come home and they offered me a job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By the time I got there, this was the very end of the '70s, late '79.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the big story then were mergers and acquisitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was just CEOs were waking up in the morning, looking at proxy contests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and discovering that they didn't run their companies anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was exciting stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just got hooked writing about business and investing in economics.</span></div><div

guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you went on to write six books so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I understand you're working on another one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I always had this desire to write more long forms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I did some magazine work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But my family, I don't mind saying, had an investment in Berkshire Hathaway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbz80RKeZc&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I got interested via that in Warren Buffett and thought he would be a good subject for a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
