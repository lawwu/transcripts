Okay, it's maybe unpopular opinion, I'm going to elaborate a bit, so in order to do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to differentiate developers between noobs and enterprise, it's a bit weird, like it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span

still, you know, like let's use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that for a second, noobs versus enterprise, so I think gen 1.0 was the autocomplete moment, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we started being able to generate writing our code and getting a few lines ahead of us, we really liked</span></div><div class="c"><span

right, so you needed to be a developer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.720</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">developers generating much more lines of code, maybe the seniors or the enterprise liked it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but also had a lot of

target="_blank">00:03:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">code, I hear that a lot, and I'm going to show you like 500 tweets about it, not really, but from some</span></div><div class="c"><span

will move from chat, agentic chat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to

to talk about a bit, and I think like you will see different players and different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">parts of this map, like I mean different tools, let's think about it again, so I think like in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">an autocomplete moment, we saw first ID plugins, again it's not a game changer, I'm just like going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to complete more lines of code for you, we liked it, and then let's rethink how we do coding inside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">ID, so we saw ID forks, and then what's the third wave, sometimes I hear forking people, I didn't say that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what I think is actually we're going to see is like AI across the STLC, okay, like being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do end-to-end flows that are specific, closing a task that is specific in the STLC, but more importantly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">using AI across the STLC, again, not only in the ID, hence, how do we do that, command line, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's one of those tools, a lot of spoilers, so I think when we had the aha moment with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">autocomplete, the next aha moment was, you know, all the hype around vibe coding, and I'm going to touch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about that, and I think the next thing that I think we're going to hear about is like, hey, I'm really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">doing 100x, choose a number, 10x, 50x, 100x development, and I'm doing that with confidence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not just like vibing through it, I think that will be a game changer moment for us, it means that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">totally broke the way we work, we're going to get to that, so I think like, I differentiated between,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I separated between noobs and enterprise, for example, I think for noobs, it means end-to-end means,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, that you prompt and get a software, a fully managed software for you, right, we, I guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we're all playing with, even if you're a developer, you're doing some POVs, or some side, or being able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to do some simple games, but then in the enterprise setup, in the heavy-duty setup, then basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what means for us, like, AI cross-desk, you'll see as reliable, versatile workflows, and when I say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">workflows, we had a few sessions, amazing sessions, I'm actually, like, combining them, which is one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">points that were made there, like, I think a child made a point where an agent is creating workflows and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">calling them, and then there was a discussion about, like, workflows and, you know, using agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera, so I'm, when I say workflows, I already mean agentic workflow, let's, let's move on, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow, agent, who cares, like, like, so it's going to be combined, and I think, like, in order to do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with trust, you need to be able, more importantly, is to have workflows or agents that are related to trust,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, having really high-quality reviewing capabilities, really high-quality testing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">capabilities, being able to do a variety of jobs to be done that we do as developers in end-to-end-ish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and high-quality, so that will be a game-changer. Let's be a bit more specific.

This is not me, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and, and, uh, and, and actually just a few weeks ago, the same Karpathy came back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and rethought vibe coding. Notice what he's saying, like, code I actually and professionally care about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">contrast vibe code. The same Karpathy, okay? And it's really interesting, I think, to analyze what he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">saying. The first thing he's saying, okay, coded I care about, probably have a duty software, or I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the quality, it's maintainable. We are gonna get to that. And then he tries to offer solution. I, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I love him. I, I, I mean, like, I never met him, but, but, uh, we all saw his videos, right? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">15 years ago, 10 years ago. So, uh, he's giving solution, not only, like, uh, like, being annoying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like, okay, no, I said by coding, no by coding anymore. So, first he's saying, the first number one is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is context. He's saying, like, bring context. Here, he's saying doing it manual, but that's not game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">changer if now I need to start bringing it manually. And then he's giving also two, three,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">four, five, six, seven. Like, this, this is a workflow. He's actually suggesting a workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's one of the topics of the three talks that we had now, okay? So, now, uh, like, this is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">important, I think. Like, how do you vibe code with confidence? You need to, like, you said, it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just vibe coding, probably you don't care about quality. You do care. You need to bring the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">context and have workflows. And these workflows can be connected to agents, could be part of the agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">could be part of your flows. And that's, like, in the nine minutes or so, some, some things I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about. Karpati and others are not the only one. This is just, like, from a week ago, uh, if you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, this, uh, a very, uh, great, great person, great material. He's saying, like, AI coding tools are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so much less useful on existing large code bases, okay? He's saying that, and, and this is differently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">than compared green for greenfield work. And it's not surprising because if you have a greenfield work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or it's a simple software, code generation is all you need, okay? Like, it's magnificent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the tip of the iceberg, give a prompt, you get your software. But when you're talking about enterprise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">heavy-duty software, then there's much more than that. We all know it, right? There is a maintainability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">testing, reviewing, et cetera.

That's why, uh, we have a multi-agent, uh, architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I am not going to go over it one by one because there's one specific thing that I wanted to show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we have, uh, a tool, we have an agent that is focused on, let's call it deep research, deep ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in code. And then, uh, we have a tool that is specific, that's our flagship for, for code review,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">called code merge. And then, finally, we have, uh, like, a tool that is inside IDEs that enable to shift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">left, like, bring that context, bring that, uh, bring that best, best practices that were collected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">over time. The code merge tool, the code review tool collects best practices over time. And this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the context that is coming from the code aware and the best practices coming for code merge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">helping you rather whatever code generation tool you're using or using directly code tool to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sure that that's in high quality. But recently, like 20 minutes ago, uh, we released also a CLI tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is meant to help you with the workflow parts. The workflow is already integrated into our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">solution, but this, like, really, uh, a workflow on steroids. There's another thing very important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that is coming out in two months, and stay tuned, follow us, whatever, any platform that you want.

So, CLI tool, why? I hope, like, I gave enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, hints, um, and, uh, so far. And the main reason is putting AI to work across the CLC. And I remind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you that starting five minutes ago, you can go download it and play with it. It's a soft launch. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to announce about it more deeply, like, in, in, in a couple of weeks. So, interestingly, who,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">who, who saw Simon, like, uh, talk, like, he's magnificent? What? Some people didn't? Okay. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">please go, uh, go out of the room, I mean. And, uh, and then come back after and watch, uh, online later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's amazing, like, when he wanted to demonstrate something, did he open, like, one of the IDEs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">He did not. Like, everything he did was with, with a CLI tool. Like, that's, if you are a developer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like, that's the idea that you can run it in the background, you can run it in different workflows,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you can make workflows. That's part of what I'm, what I'm going to show you. And, and basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">with, with Codo, uh, the CLI tool, which is live, uh, live here, uh, then I can, for example, chat with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And very interestingly, that is very, quite, like, there are a few tools that we talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">before that you can do that. But interestingly, you can call agents. For example, I can call the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the explain agent. It's a dedicated agent. Uh, due to lack of time, I'm not going to show that. I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to show something else. So, how does, how did we made this explain agent? You can actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with Codo the agent, you can make other agents. And soon, I'm going to show you how you also create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">workflows and things like that. So, basically, I can go and ask it, if the internet works, uh, well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">enough, uh, you can go and ask it, please create an agent with this goal. And, and by the way, you can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, uh, uh, like, give much more information than what I'm doing right now. I'm asking for it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">create a review agent. Okay? If the internet works, it's, it's going to start working. It's initializing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP. It's going to search what it can do, what it cannot do. And now it's, it's going to work for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for a few minutes. Okay? Like, if I would ask you to do it, you would do it, take it in two hours. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">let's give it two minutes. Meanwhile, I'm going to, to progress and, and, uh, and tell you that the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the interesting things, uh, about it, it's, it's working. So, one, uh, most agents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I can't think of, of, of, of one that won't, would have tools. Uh, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the Kodo cover agent, uh, by the way, we have an open source for Kodo cover. Uh, it's a tool that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically, uh, generates coverage, coverage, uh, it increases the coverage, automatically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">increases coverage, but you don't need anymore to go download this open source, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You just get it as part of the, uh, uh, as one of the agent. Okay? So, uh, but if you do want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to play with the open source, et cetera, it's, it's fully open source. Okay. Back, back to my point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I can go and call Kodo cover, which uses different tools. For example, it uses tools related to coverage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reports. Uh, and, and you, I can look what I can do in a command line. I can tell it dump all the logs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere, right? How do you do that with an ID plugin? You can, but you need to hack it, hack it. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the interesting thing, what can we do with command lines? And many here are, are developers. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">pipe, you can pipe, uh, uh, tools together. Agents, you can pipe, like, uh, uh, uh, workflows, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to run Kodo code, generating code. And then I want to run the cover that, like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">increase the coverage testing. Maybe the code will generate a few tests, but I have an agent that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that is specializing in increasing coverage. And then I want the review agent that is now cooking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and finished. Uh, um, and I'll go back to it in a minute if I have time. Now, this is not no agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to engine communication. I did a pipeline that just passed the result, but what if we can, and, and, and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and before I exemplified with MCP, but what if we can invent a command line for A to A? So those agents are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, uh, will run in parallel as you go and they will have some communication, uh, between them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I actually have to say that yesterday we had like a 20, uh, 50, uh, like people like, like those that you had,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, we, uh, uh, speakers and I asked who is using A to A? No one is using it. So it's still a way to go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but this is an example. Oh, yes. Come to talk to me later. So I will know one person. Okay. Thank you. So, uh, uh, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I'll edit all the posts. Uh, I know one person and, and, uh, and, and, and, but, but we're getting there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. This is an example. You need multiple agents. You need A to A. You, you would want to use it if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">want discover, discoverability between agents or handshakes. So this is a good example if you have many agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can run them in the background, et cetera. So in this case, the agent finished and I have the definition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I have the definition of the, of the agent, uh, over, over here. Uh, it's called merge agent and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">can see like, like all everything, the instruction that was made for it, uh, like what tools it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it is using. Uh, I'm going to add one that, uh, sometime I want to be very clear. It's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, it also has like a, uh, output scheme. I'm going to remove that, move that for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And then I can go back, uh, and, and just call it, it was called merge review, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Kodo merge, uh, review agent. It was just generated a minute ago and it will review. I didn't give it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">any, you see that there's a parameter automatically created like, uh, uh, that, that, uh, uh, I, I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">tell it what to review, et cetera, give instruction. It's very flexible, but I didn't. Uh, okay. So, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm almost lack of time, so I won't, uh, show you, but what I just will tell you that basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I can tell it to use best practices from the organization important for vibe coding with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">confidence. And I can also tell it to have some success or, or, or failure criteria to know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">something happened well or not. For example, if it managed to get some coverage, okay, that's how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">work with, with confidence. Um, yeah. And you can connect things to pre-commit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">post commit, okay. And everything you can do, you can do automatically. Very interestingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and with that, uh, almost reached the end, very, very interestingly, you can say the CLI tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is very lame. But notice, did you notice what, what Simon did? He used the CLI, but eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">checking content, he, he used different interfaces. So, you can, from the CLI itself, automatically generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interfaces that are fitting for your task. And one of those, for example, is an interface for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for code review. So, who cares anymore about IDEs when you can have flexible IDs? And with that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll finish, and I'll just tell you that I think we're going into a future where we're going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">swarm of agents, each one specializing and having different credential, different, uh, best, best practices,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">etc. And, uh, and, and, and it's coming really fast, 2025, 2026. Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
