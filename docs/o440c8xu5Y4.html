He is done wrangling with the microphones in the HQ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he has put in a question designed to get me canceled so that he can he can be freed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we go. This question is from Fiona, who says, what are your thoughts on the relationship between the deep life and privilege?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We already talked about, like Donald Trump for five minutes at the beginning of this episode, so we're probably already I don't know which side is going to cancel us at this point, but like we probably upset them all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's see here. Elaborating Fiona says a while back, you talked a bit about Virginia Woolf's A Room of Your Own, A Room of One's Own, and how living the deep life and having space for contemplation is an essential part of the human condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This really resonated with me. But also made me worry about those who can't afford cost associated with high quality leisure in their free time. Books and newspapers can be expensive, but Twitter is free. Big fan. Thanks for all you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, Fiona, A Room of One's Own reference was from digital minimalism. I was talking about that in digital minimalism where Woolf was making this argument that space for contemplation and which is necessary for reflection and self-definition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is fundamental to the human condition. And so looking at society at that time, women literally did not have the physical space in which to actually go and have the time to contemplate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they're being deprived of that fundamental part of the human condition. This is sort of like an Aristotelian argument that is in this contemplation that humans become humans. It is our teleology. There we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been a long day. And she was making a sort of feminist argument about that being denied because of cultural constraints. So I think that's what Fiona was talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's think about privilege and the deep life. So I have a specific answer and then maybe a more general tangent just because I'm a professor and I can't help myself. So specifically, when it comes to pragmatic nonfiction in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so pragmatic nonfiction is where my books often live. This is books that give advice or hints or ideas about living. Right. So within pragmatic nonfiction, almost by definition, you're going to have a pretty narrow audience to which the advice mainly applies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if we're thinking about the world population in whole. Most American pragmatic nonfiction is pretty narrow. Like if you are in Kiev right now, you have no interest in digital minimalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not relevant to you and your situation. It is not helpful to you. Right. You have to be in a pretty specific situation where you're lucky enough to care about things like digital minimalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then even once you get to a population for which a book is addressed, for which the topics are relevant, you then get infinite gradations within that population about the extent to which you are able to actually execute that advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe you're like, let's just look at like American upper middle class knowledge workers with financial stability and flexibility in their schedule. Right. So this is a group that can think about things like high quality leisure. And what am I going to do with my time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to have infinite gradations within that group. Someone might say, yeah, I might have that, but I also have an autoimmune disorder. I'm dealing with chronic pain. I can't really make great use of that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then how do you compare that to someone who has much less time? Maybe they're working two jobs, but then have like a high energy. They don't sleep much. They just constitutionally have like a high energy and are able to aggressively fill in that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have infinite gradations within populations for which pragmatic nonfiction applies. And there's no total ordering function on it. You can't even directly compare everyone to everyone else. So it's all kind of a mess, but it's absolutely real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a good observation. So what do we do about that? And you could use privilege to explain that. I mean, you could use privilege as a shorthand for the particular combination of traits and properties you have that define your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's quite a few of those that were to some degree or largely outside of your control or happenstance or luck, and everyone has a different configuration. And how do we deal with that? And it's kind of a hard question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One approach I think that has become popular now has been in your writing itself to do a sort of self-attestation about a sampling of various privileges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or in other words, like a sampling of I'm in this group, this group, this would be less relevant over here. I don't think it's relevant. Here's one thing I have. So you just sort of like self-attestation of privilege.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I see this a lot in modern books, like usually early on, like let me sort of enumerate aspects of my identity and talk about other aspects that I don't have and that this would, let me do like a disclaimer, you know, early on in the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I say a sampling because again, there's infinite gradations. And so like you basically are just randomly choosing a few things. Like if you're here, here, this might not be as relevant. And that here and here is sort of sampled from a much broader sampling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think that's fine. I think the disclaimer approach, though, is probably more creedal than functional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I mean about it is by creedal, I mean, it's more of a like a declaration of allegiance, a declaration of allegiance to the group that takes quite seriously the various theoretical frameworks from which these notions arose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's fine. But I think it's more creedal than functional. So by functional, I mean, does it actually improve this situation in some way? And I don't know that the attestations or the attestations or disclaimers really do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3190" target="_blank">00:53:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, again, I'm speaking from very narrow experience here, but in my career of doing pragmatic nonfiction and talks, I've worked with a lot of different groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3199" target="_blank">00:53:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I used to do a lot of work with community colleges, first generation college students, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I'm not particularly convinced that these creedal disclaimers up front in books make much of a difference. I think there's a notion that it is like makes people more comfortable, but I don't think it does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think they care. I think sometimes it can seem ironically quite privileged to be focusing on, you know, disclaiming all these things about yourself as opposed to just getting to the information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other thing I've noticed is that there's a lot of populations, and again, this comes from my just personal experience, I don't know if it generalizes, that often finds it to be a little bit condescending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I definitely encountered that with digital minimalism. So I did a big tour for digital minimalism and talked to lots of different groups and lots of different demographics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was this interesting split where whenever I would do like sort of more elite media, like NPR or something like this, there would always be this notion of like, I mean, this is only relevant to like upper middle class, knowledge worker white people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the only people for which thinking about their tools and the role of their phone in their life, that's the only people that's kind of relevant for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And just like Fiona in your question here, like newspapers are expensive and like Twitter is what people need if they can't afford newspapers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you would go and actually do events. There's a huge international readership of this book. So all sorts of different ethnic, racial and economic backgrounds of people who read this book that I encounter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they would say, what are you talking about? I don't want to be on Instagram all the time. Like, yeah, I want to hear, I want to hear this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what do you mean?

Writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3502" target="_blank">00:58:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, what is writing other than a human trying to capture in words their own internal experience in a way that is legible to other people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is no field where I think it's more important than to have different voices there because you're literally making different experiences legible to other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so maybe I'm less interested. I mean, I can again, I can affirm and disclaim here's who I am.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of people who are different than me, but what probably is going to matter is having people who are different than me write books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm a big believer in that in those efforts. I've been somewhat involved in those. I'd like to be involved more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3532" target="_blank">00:58:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think books are the place where you are going to get the biggest bang for your buck for bringing in different voices because the entire experience of reading is melding empathetically with the mind of an author.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a direct mind meld. And so, yeah, my, a book I write is going to be narrow because my background that might be even more narrowed and I can talk about it and that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not hurt. It's not going to hurt anything, but it's also not going to solve much things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we have other people kind of the same topics from completely different angles or backgrounds or identities, now you start to get this interesting, rich, diverse number of approaches on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3576" target="_blank">00:59:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Understand other people better people who might not really connect to Cal Newport might connect to someone else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o440c8xu5Y4&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that really matters as well.
