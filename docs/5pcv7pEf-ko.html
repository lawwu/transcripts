Thank you for joining us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Talk to us about Christian universalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First off, what do you mean when you talk about Christian universalism?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first of all, starting with the word "universalism," "universalism" quite simply, which has different meanings in different contexts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the context of theology, it means quite simply the idea that in the end, everyone is saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That would mean all human beings, every human individual without exception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it could also be extended, of course, to the fallen angels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The unfallen angels would not be saved, but fallen angels, Satan, and the demons would be saved as well if you hold to a full-bore universalist vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christian universalism may add something to that that says that all that salvation occurs in and through Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Christian universalism, therefore, would be different from an inter-religious universalism, of which there's plenty in the culture now that all roads lead to God and that one need not come through Christ to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A Christian universalist says, "No, it has to be through Christ, but somehow through Christ, all will be saved."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you write, you bring such a vast awareness to a subject.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some of the various stripes of this so-called Christian universalism that you've discovered in these years of research?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it is a big story. One of the reasons the book was as long as it is, is that the question of final salvation is intertwining with question of—to a surprising extent, intertwined with things like the doctrine of the Atonement, the question of free will, the question of election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's almost no major doctrine that isn't somehow entailed in some way in the discussion of universalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the current situation is highly eclectic. I say in my book that there are many schools of fish swimming in the universalist pond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only thing that many universals have in common is the idea of a final salvation for all, but there are major, major differences between them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The ways in which you argue some, basing it primarily on human free choice, others on divine election, the Bardian type of universalism or tendency toward universalism would focus on God's overriding purpose that will somehow achieve its aim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there are various forms of agnostic, esoteric universalism in which everyone has a spark of the divine within that is destined to return back to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of variation, and I actually think that the universals are maybe not aware of how much they differ among themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Speaking of Karl Barth, I think you do really fine work in the book showing that his doctrine of election is problematic here, and he essentially codes universalism into the DNA of his soteriology through universal election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Soga, your book is a massive historical study that spans decades and centuries of trends, but what's the current state of Christian universalism in the West today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My impression is that the Internet and digital media are very, very prominent today in the promotion of universalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's certainly plenty of books, if one goes to Amazon.com and puts in Christian universalism, there will be lots of popular books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Many, many of them published within the last 20 years. There's almost this amazing takeoff of new popular literature since about 1999, so in the new millennium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you had to look at the world as a whole and find a digital center, a kind of distribution online, it's actually here in Missouri, Herman, Missouri.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is tentmaker.org, which is a website run by some people connected to a friend of a friend, Gary Amaro.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an aggregation site. It's sort of like the drudge of the universalist world because they have lots of links to universalist literature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My understanding is that Gary Amaro discovered sort of 19th century universalism and then decided, became very intrigued, interested in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he had been a missionary at one point. I think that's where the tentmaker.org came from, but there's a huge amount of material there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also another site called evangelicaluniversalist.org.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I did the crazy thing. I went into that website and I found there was 100,000 words of comment on an early lecture I gave at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I logged in under my own name and suddenly I had dozens and dozens of people shooting questions at me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was actually exhausting. I just had to disengage at that point. And I guess, who knows, maybe I'll re-engage at some point after they've looked at the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Universalism is alive and well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is alive and well. Remarkably, a man in my own congregation took me out to lunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a wealthy retired businessman, but who had had a house church in his home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're sitting over lunch and then he pulls out an app on his phone and he starts reading from something called the Mirror Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Mirror Bible says that the only difference between Jesus and us is that Jesus knew and understood his own identity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So essentially, this is a very much a Gnostic teaching that we all have God within us or are identical to God, that we are eternal in our essential nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He started reading from this and this gentleman in my church, who I won't name, but he actually was trying to win my own pastor over to Universalist views.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this book that I wrote for everyone out there, suddenly it is literally affecting the person right next to me in the pew in my own congregation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it struck close to home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Frightening. I can imagine church leaders hear you tell the story and they want to be proactive to ensure that Universalism doesn't get a foothold in their own churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you say to pastors?

Preach the cross of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If the cross is preached in its full depth and richness and integrity, then it shows us God's holy hatred and opposition for sin and his profound love that was willing to endure the destructive weight of sin in order for us to be redeemed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you preach the cross rightly and properly, then I think so many theological issues take care of themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think one of the reasons that we have Universalism emerging in the church is that we haven't been preaching the cross.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The cross shows us that our salvation did not come cheaply, that it came at a very high price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would recommend John Stott's marvelous book, The Cross of Christ, which really is a multidimensional study that looks at the cross and suffering, the cross and the problem of evil, the cross and the Christian life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For someone who says, "I'd like to begin putting the cross more at the center of my preaching," that book might give some clues as to how to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcv7pEf-ko&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, excellent.
