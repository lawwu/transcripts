The story is recounted in John 12, verses 1-8, and I'll read it. Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</p><p>So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table. Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</p><p>But Judas Iscariot, one of the disciples, said, "Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii, a year's salary, and then given to the poor?" He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put in it.</p><p>Jesus said, "Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial. For the poor you will always have with you, but you do not always have me." John Piper picks up here in his 2011 sermon. Judas, let me start by giving you the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>You love the poor? Guess what? The rest of your life, serve the poor. They're always going to be there. In fact, Judas, you better love the poor. I love the poor. So, you may now feel free, with no obstacle from Mary at all, to love the poor the rest of your days.</p><p>Go ahead, Judas. Judas, I know you don't love the poor. And you don't love me. You love money. In five days, you'll sell me for thirty pieces of silver. Listen, Judas. Listen, Bethlehem. Listen, world. To the Apostle Paul. Where did he learn this? Where did Paul learn this? We brought nothing into the world.</p><p>We will take nothing out of the world. If we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. But those who desire to be rich, fall into temptation. Into a snare. Into many hurtful and senseless desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.</p><p>And by this kind of craving, some have wandered away from the faith, oh Judas, and pierced themselves with many pangs. The love of money is suicidal. Jesus said it. Paul said it. Judas proved it. Do you love money? Do you want to be rich? That's what the Bible says.</p><p>If you want to be rich, you're on a suicidal track. Judas, Bethlehem. If you can't see me and my worth, you're going to die. And never see me again. You can't serve two masters. Either you will love the one and hate the other, or you'll despise the one and be devoted to the other.</p><p>You can't serve God in money. You're devoted to money, Judas. You're devoted to money. You get up in the morning and think money. You go to bed at night and you think money. You open the newspaper and go to the stock page and you think money, money, money, money, money.</p><p>It is the hope and the God that you have. It's your security. It's your pathway to pleasure. And you're dead. You're going to die, Judas. And never see me again. Think what Mary could have bought. That's reason number two, leave her alone. You're a lover of money, not a lover of me.</p><p>Wow, what a poignant clip. It was pulled from John Pepper's sermon, "Leave Her Alone, Judas. This is for My Burial," which was preached on November 5, 2011. The clip was sent in to us by Brady in Richfield, Minnesota. Thank you, Brady. Please keep those suggested clips coming in to us.</p><p>And when we share a clip on Wednesdays, the full sermon is always available online at DesiringGod.org. We return tomorrow with John Pepper himself. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks, as always, for listening in.</p></div></div></body></html>
