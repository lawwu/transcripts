Flying direct with Fiji Airways. Hey Radicals, this is Joshua Sheets. If you are in the Nashville, Tennessee area, I will be up your way this coming week. I will arrive on Monday, February 22 and I will be there in Nashville on Tuesday, February 23, Wednesday, February 24, and Thursday, February 25, 2016.</p><p>If you are in the Nashville area on any of those days, please reach out to me on Twitter at JoshuaSheets if you would like to meet up while I am there in the area. I love when I go traveling or when I'm at a conference. I really, really enjoy meeting up and talking with listeners, sometimes just for a few minutes, sometimes for a long time.</p><p>But please reach out to me on Twitter at JoshuaSheets, again, J-O-S-H-U-A-S-H-E-A-T-S. Link to my Twitter profile in the little blog post and show notes for this show. At the moment, I'm not intending to host a group meetup, so you'll have to reach out to me and we will coordinate something specifically.</p><p>Watch my Twitter feed for information on that. I will be at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center at 2800 Opryland Drive, Nashville, Tennessee, 37214. If you're at the hotel or if you're in the area and you see me, please don't hesitate to say hello. I'm kind of hard to miss these days.</p><p>I'm about 6'6" and I have a massive red beard, so it's a little bit hard to miss me at this point in time. If you're not in Nashville, but you'd like to keep track, if you're just interested in seeing pictures of what's going on, connect with me on all the social media stuff, Instagram.com/JoshuaSheets, Facebook.com/JoshuaSheets or Twitter.com/JoshuaSheets.</p><p>I probably don't say that stuff as much as I should, but I do really enjoy connecting with listeners there. It helps me to get a sense of who you guys are when I look at your pictures and I'm able to connect on those social profiles. Feel free to friend me on Facebook or to look me up on Instagram or Twitter and please, connect with me there.</p><p>I'm a regular listener of the show and then I can get a little insight into your lives. Social media is awesome because podcasting otherwise is sometimes a one-way lonely communication. So I really enjoy connecting with you guys on those channels and I hope to meet many of you in Nashville next week.</p><p>Don't just dream about paradise. Live it with Fiji Airways.
