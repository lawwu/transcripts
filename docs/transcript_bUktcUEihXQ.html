Kind of highlight them or circle them and say, we know that we could trade this out if we needed to. Right, we know that we can like cancel this if we had to because it doesn't matter to us or it's not locking us in.</p><p>So if we look at an itinerary a week out and we're like, whoa, this is a lot. And this isn't matching the vision we set nine months ago when we had this idea, circle and create some space for you to be flexible with this trip. Because you never know what might happen.</p><p>Friends of ours were just in Lisbon and Morocco and the moment they got to Lisbon, their four year old developed an ear infection. And so the next three days of the Lisbon plans were out the door. You can't plan for that, right? So circle those things that don't really matter in the end and know that you have some flexibility going into your trip and then go have amazing, amazing times, document the hell out of it, live in the moment, don't be on your phone looking at what everybody else is doing on Instagram.</p><p>Be present, eat that thing, eat another one of them</p></div></div></body></html>
