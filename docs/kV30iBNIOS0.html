Welcome, James. Welcome, Adam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.

Okay, so I think I will do this kind of in order. I think James, you're sort of the primary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">author. So James, you are head of engineering at Elicit. You also were VP Eng at Teespring and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Spring as well. And you also, you know, you have a long history in sort of engineering. How did you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, find your way into something like Elicit where, you know, you are basically a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">traditional sort of VP Eng, VP technology type person moving into more of an AI role?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's right. It definitely was something of a sideways move, if not a left turn. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">story there was I'd been doing, as you said, VP technology, CTO type stuff for around about 15</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">years or so. And noticed that there was this crazy explosion of capability and interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff happening within AI and ML and language models, that kind of thing. I guess this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in 2019 or so, and decided that I needed to get involved. You know, this is a kind of generational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">shift. Spent maybe a year or so trying to get up to speed on the state of the art, reading papers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reading books, practicing things, that kind of stuff. Was going to found a startup actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in the space of interpretability and transparency. And through that met Andreas, who has obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">been on the podcast before, asked him to be an advisor for my startup. And he countered with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"Maybe you'd like to come and run the engineering team at Elicit," which it turns out was a much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">better idea. And yeah, I kind of quickly changed in that direction. So I think some of the stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're going to be talking about today is how actually a lot of the work when you're building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">applications with AI and ML looks and smells and feels much more like conventional software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering with a few key differences, rather than really deep ML stuff. And I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the reasons why I was able to transfer the skills over from one place to the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I do often say that I think AI engineering is about 90%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">software engineering with the 10% of really strong, really differentiated AI engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously that number might change over time. I want to also welcome Adam onto my podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because you welcomed me onto your podcast two years ago. And I'm really, really glad for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a fun episode. You famously founded Heroku. You just wrapped up a few years working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on Muse. And now you describe yourself as a journalist, internal journalist working on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Elicit. Yeah, well, I'm kind of a little bit in a wandering phase here and trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">take this time in between ventures to see what's out there in the world. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">some of my wandering took me to the Elicit team and found that they were some of the folks who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">were doing the most interesting, really deep work in terms of taking the capabilities of language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">models and applying them to what I feel like are really important problems. So in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">science and literature search and that sort of thing. It fits into my general interest in tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and productivity software. I think of it as a tool for thought in many ways, but a tool for science,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, if we can accelerate that discovery of new medicines and things like that, that's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">so powerful. But to me, it's kind of also an opportunity to learn at the feet of some real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">masters in this space, people who have been working on it since before it was cool, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">want to put it that way. So for me, the last couple of months have been this crash course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And why I sometimes describe myself as an internal journalist is I'm helping to write some posts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">including supporting James in this article here we're doing for Latent Space, where I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">bringing my writing skill and that sort of thing to bear on their very deep domain expertise around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">language models and applying them to the real world and kind of surface that in a way that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">accessible, legible, that sort of thing. And so the great benefit to me is I get to learn this stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in a way that I don't think I would or I haven't, just kind of tinkering with my own side projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, totally. I forgot to mention that you also run Ink and Switch, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the leading research labs, in my mind, of the tools for thought productivity space,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever people mentioned there, or maybe future programming even, a little bit of that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you guys definitely started the local first wave. I think they were just the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">conference that you guys held.

Local First,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, a whole other topic we can talk about on another day. I think there actually is a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">more, what would you call it, handshake emoji between language models and the local first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">data model. And that was part of the topic of the conference here. But yeah, topic for another day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Not necessarily.

And it's not like I've defined a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hiring process that I'm super happy with, even though I've worked with a number of AI engineers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just leave it open to you, James. How was your process of defining your hiring roles?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So I think the first thing to say is that we've effectively been hiring for this kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">role since before you coined the term and tried to kind of build this understanding of what it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which is not a bad thing. It was a concept that was coming to the fore and effectively needed a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">name, which is what you did. So the reason I mentioned that is I think it was something that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of backed into, if you will. We didn't sit down and come up with a brand new role from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">scratch. This is a completely novel set of responsibilities and skills that this person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">would need. However, it is a kind of particular blend of different skills and attitudes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">curiosities, interests, which I think makes sense to kind of bundle together. So in the post, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">three things that we say are most important for a highly effective AI engineer are, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">conventional software engineering skills, which is kind of a given, but definitely worth mentioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing is a curiosity and enthusiasm for machine learning and maybe in particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">language models. That's certainly true in our case. And then the third thing is to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">basically a fault-first mindset, being able to build systems that can handle things going wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in some sense. And yeah, I think the kind of middle point, the curiosity about ML and language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">models is probably fairly self-evident. They're going to be working with and prompting and dealing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with the responses from these models. So that's clearly relevant. The last point though, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">takes the most explaining to do with this fault-first mindset and the ability to build resilient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">systems. The reason that is so important is because compared to normal APIs where normal, think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">something like a Stripe API or a search API or something like this, conventional search API,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the latency when you're working with language models is wild.

But from our perspective, when we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">building Illicit, what we primarily care about is what can these models do?

So that's an enthusiasm for the space and following</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">along.

And all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things may trade off against each other. Maybe it's actually, it's very slightly worse, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">way faster and way cheaper.

And I think that mix of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">curiosity, artistic, open-ended, what can we do with this, with a desire to systematize, control,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">make reliable, make repeatable, is the mix you need. And trying to find that balance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, is probably where it's at. Fundamentally, I think people who are getting into this field,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to work on this, is because they're excited by the promise and the potential of the technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So to not have that kind of creative, open-ended, curiosity side would be surprising. Why do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise?

So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=3844" target="_blank">01:04:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">takeaway from that is finding a way of presenting yourself to and identifying and bringing in really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=3851" target="_blank">01:04:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">high capability young people into your organization.

I think the second thing is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV30iBNIOS0&t=3875" target="_blank">01:04:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of the interview process.
