What are we doing wrong? I won't tell you why I think we are the worst breathers. I will tell you why we are the worst breathers. So there's a number of different things. I'll start with the most obvious.</p><p>And to me, it was the most revelatory thing. The fact that our faces have changed. Our mouths have changed. Our airways have changed. Our sinus cavities have changed in the past around 300 to 400 years. And this has been caused by industrialized food. We don't chew and everything's shrunk, which is why we have crooked teeth.</p><p>And with crooked teeth, you have a smaller mouth, smaller mouth, smaller airway breathing problems. That's the first of a multifaceted series of reasons why we are such terrible breathers.</p></div></div></body></html>
