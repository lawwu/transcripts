Bill, over that period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We

target="_blank">00:01:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The reconciliation bill is on track to passing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have some talks of a ceasefire in Ukraine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The market, which was down 20% for the year, has now bounced 20% in the last 20 trading days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe today we could just unpack this fury of activity that's occurred over the last three weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That sounds great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So you were at the big event, the one that everyone's talking about in the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Why don't you, if you would, you know, give the listeners, I think at first just kind of, what did it feel like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What was different this time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You've been there before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But frame what happened, you know, just at first from, you know, what did this look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'd be interested in your takeaways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I have to say the whole orientation, if you just think about it, toward the Middle East over the last few years has been kind of about control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we had CFIUS that was blocking all these deals in the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We had the Biden diffusion rule that remember that in the final weeks of the Biden administration, they passed a rule known as the diffusion rule that really created this complicated regulatory framework for selling advanced chips and models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it broadly restricted the ability of the U.S. to sell chips to like 100 countries around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that, you know, it felt like a massive 180 shift from what I would call the Washington approach of control and preventing diffusion of American technologies to much more of a Silicon Valley approach to partnership and openness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the language that I heard, you know, I was I was happy to be part of an A.I. delegation with a lot of CEOs who were over there helping to craft these deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, and getting to ride shotgun on some meetings with with David Sachs, you know, who is obviously leading the A.I. initiatives for the administration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have to say, it just was incredibly well received in Riyadh and Doha and Abu Dhabi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a spirit of partnership in every one of those places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And you saw the fruits of that major announcements of investments in the United States and major deals getting struck about, you know, A.I. data centers, et cetera, that are opening in that part of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That's amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Of all those things, which one surprised you the most?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a really big change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you can't underscore enough what it means, you know, like the Trump administration just repealed the Biden diffusion rule in May of 25.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it literally is fresh off of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you would have told me that in the first five months of this year, we would have gotten a trillion dollar deal signed with Saudi in terms of their investment in the United States, another trillion dollars with Qatar, another trillion dollars with the UAE.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are all investments into the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then let me give you a sense of the scale of magnitude of the deal that was announced in Abu Dhabi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So in Abu Dhabi, they announced a five gigawatt USAI, you know, it's a UAE USAI campus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an incredible architectural campus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's in collaboration with NVIDIA and OpenAI and Oracle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And think of it as almost like a global Stargate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So to put that in perspective, five gigs, every gig is about 500,000 GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's about two and a half million GPUs worth of compute power to power the AI initiatives out of the UAE around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you would have told me that that would have come together in this short a period of time, I wouldn't have believed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Howard Lutnick played an incredibly important role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Scott Bessett was there with the president.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, David Sachs helping to put those deals together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You had CEOs, you know, you were asking how it looked and felt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you had pretty much every major CEO in U.S. technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Jensen Huang was there, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were putting these deals together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So there were just a feeling of the art of the deal, what is possible, partnership and acceleration, as opposed to the deceleration, you know, and the control that I think you and I have felt over the last few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And frankly, you and I have been worried about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This idea that the U.S. was going to somehow, you know, shut down our AI and not allow the rest of the world to have access to our AI, I think we not only thought that was bad policy from an economic perspective, but also just dangerous for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It was basically going to allow for this Huawei Belt and Road where Chinese full stack technologies would move into the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've read that was basically underway prior to this big event.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In Saudi alone, Huawei's market share has gone up a lot over the last few years, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not as though these countries don't have, they don't have the ability to do nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And they felt a little, frankly, betrayed by the United States, I think, over the course of the last few years.</span></div><div

the Minister of Technology, Al-Sawaha.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.660</a></span> | <span

year from now, this would have been largely – they would have made commitments to build on Chinese AI stacks because they couldn't afford to do nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think the timing of this change was critical.</span></div><div

a question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think the

target="_blank">00:08:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think the competitive advantage is of these national data centers in the Middle East?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, first, you know, you and I talk about it all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Primitive to AI is power, and they have cheap power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, eventually, the price of producing tokens, we're effectively converting electrons, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They're cheap energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, it's both solar and nuclear and natural gas, some of the largest natural gas fields in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Those things are being converted into intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And to say more broadly, you know, for the last 50 years, this part of the world has been powering the industrial age by exporting oil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think their view to the future is they want to power the age of AI through the production of tokens and the export of tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, and that's just converting, you know, this power into tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that, I believe, is a critical element.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's the other thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, let me poke it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to poke it down a little bit because I've been just out of curiosity thinking about maybe trying to break down in my mind the percentage of cost, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're out buying a token on the open market that's tied to power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll tell you what I discovered, but I was just really talking with AI and a few friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So if anyone in the audience has better numbers, let me know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I've seen is cooling and power might be 20% of COGS, which depending on your gross margin on your hosting, let's say maybe power is 15% of COGS or I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that would equate to maybe 10% of revenues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you had, let's say, a two-to-one power advantage, you might pick up five percentage points of operating margin, something like that, or be able to price 5% lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just trying to frame that advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I would throw a few other things in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, right, you just have the issue of latency, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So this part of the world needs local data centers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So whether it's for Africa, whether it's for Europe, whether it's for the Middle East itself, whether it's for India.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think there's just proximity that's an important consideration here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, the cost of labor and their building and investing in these robotic futures where they're building very futuristic data centers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think for a long time, the U.S. has viewed, for example, this part of the world as perhaps a bit of an industrial powerhouse when it comes to oil, but not very technologically advanced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would tell you, listening to Shake Tech Noon, you know, in the UAE and their commitment, they are as technology forward as anything here in Silicon Valley, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Paying at G42, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And all three of these countries are going to invest aggressively at a level that really no other sovereign on a global basis is investing at to ensure that this part of the world becomes a center for technology and AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's critical that the U.S. was their partner in that regard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, Sachs, I saw, tweeted when we got back something that I thought was important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, you know, this AI acceleration partnership is not just a single deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a new framework for advancing American AI, both at home and abroad, you know, and positioning the U.S. tech stack to be the partner of choice in this region for decades to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this wasn't just a one-off deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of people who are hearing about these deals thought, oh, maybe Trump went over there, worked his art of the deal, and got a deal done with the Saudis or the Qataris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But, no, I think this is a framework that the world can depend upon, that, in fact, they are going to have access to these technologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me give you a comparison, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you imagine if in the year 2000, Washington, D.C. had said, oh, my God, Google is so powerful that we're not going to allow any other country in the world to have access to this Google machine that might give them answers to questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">unless Google comes to Washington and gets federal approval before it launches in any of these countries?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it would have prevented Google from ever becoming the global powerhouse that it has become, which has been so advantageous to the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Hard power, soft power, economic power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what we were doing in AI, and I think we've ripped the chains off of that, and I think now we're going to allow our companies to go compete and win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, and to frame that a little more, I just put on X earlier today an article in the Wall Street Journal that just came out that was talking about how far behind Europe is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and broadly speaking, in terms of business culture and tech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And the article goes into a lot of detail about how complex regulations have limited or stifled innovation, both on the labor side and on the technology side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And the policies that were being considered, let's say, three months ago, to me, all were mirror images of the ones that are listed out in this article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we were 100% on a path towards building a wall around America, not building a wall around China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we had continued on that path, I think I would have predicted, had we continued around that path, that, you know, if you look at the internet era, there really was the rest of the world using Americans' internet, and then China built their own internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we were headed towards a path where we were going to have a wall around America, and there was going to be America AI, and then China AI was going to have the rest of the world, the opposite of the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Bingo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think had we continued on that path, or if we go back towards that path, because I don't think this is over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think some of the rhetoric coming out of the Hill and Valley Conference was more consistent with the wall around America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a great sign that we're not, you know, holistically committed to that strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think you said it incredibly well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be a disaster for this country if we embarked on a path that was the opposite of what we did in the age of the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The United States was the greatest beneficiary from the internet boom of the last 20 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The AI boom is going to be even bigger than the internet boom, and we need to follow the pattern and the protocol and approach that has made the United States a global leader in technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We do not want to be copying Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We do not want to be in the situation that China was in the age of internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think this was a major and important first step in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.700</a></span> | <span

a headline this morning that said Trump's rush for AI deals in the Gulf opened up a rift with China hawks in the administration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know that there are still these, you know, effective altruist types who are these decelerationists in Silicon Valley who don't want to see the diffusion of any of this AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's creating this weird coalition of folks who have resisted the diffusion of American technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I am firmly in the camp that we are not only safer, we are more prosperous when the world runs on the American AI stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought last week was, I was celebratory because it was planting a major flag in this incredibly important part of the world with world-class allies who have major resources

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably another $10 billion of profits to NVIDIA that were lost that they would have otherwise plowed into research and development to keep America at the forefront of chip technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that we could still see as part of the negotiation over the next 90 days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I would not be terribly surprised to see NVIDIA allowed to sell some form of deprecated chip into China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know, again, different people have different opinions on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">My opinion, and I think you share this, is China already has frontier AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Huawei is already there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We have demonstrable evidence of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And their models are already there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Arguably, their open source models might even be in front of the United States at this point in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's no keeping China from frontier AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So the better question is, are we better off competing against them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we better off selling to those countries, those companies, keeping companies like ByteDance and Tencent, et cetera, in the CUDA ecosystem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than allowing all of that data, all of those profits to flow right into the Huawei ecosystem and benefit the Chinese AI stack?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, listen, I think that's a closer call than selling chips to the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But when push comes to shove, I would sell chips into China because I think it's a net benefit to the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've talked about that in the past, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are many, many, many people who now believe that restricting our technology into China just gives them more and more incentive to implement their own technology faster and to invest behind it, which has been happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, if you look at autos, robotics, et cetera, I mean, there's plenty of evidence about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, another, I would say the third big thing that's happened since you and I were last on, I can't believe, by the way, you step away for like 15 days, you know, and all of this stuff happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">AI time has new data every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But the other big one here is underway is the reconciliation bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a reminder to folks, we have to pass a budget for the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The reconciliation bill, it's a special type of legislation in the Congress designed to expedite, right, budget-related laws.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way it does this bill is it basically suspends the filibuster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So long as you're complying with these budget rules in the Senate, known as the Byrd rules, which is the only things that can go in to this package have to be related to the budget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if that is the case, then you only have to get to 50 votes in the Senate rather than the 60 votes otherwise required to be filibuster-proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you basically take all of these smaller pieces of legislation that might have otherwise touched the tax code or the budget, and you roll them up into this huge package called a reconciliation bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the reconciliation bill, it started with a draft in the House.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The Senate will then review that draft, and the White House is weighing in on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, you know, the expected timeline, I think the president was at the, you know, spoke to the House caucus today, but it's expected to be passed out of the House this week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the Senate will weigh in on it for two to three weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It will amend some of the language in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It will add things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It will subtract things, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It will send it back to the House at the end of June.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the president is expected to sign it into law somewhere at the end of the month or around the 1st or 2nd of July.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe we can break down a little bit what's in the package, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the biggest thing is it's the extension of the Trump tax cuts, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so remember, when those tax cuts were passed in 2017, they only had a 10-year life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're set to expire in about a year unless they're extended.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that would be a major, like a $3 trillion, $4 trillion increase to taxes at the end of this year unless they're extended.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing they do is just extend those tax cuts for another 5 to 10 years, whatever they agree on in the reconciliation package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you have all these additional tax cuts that he talked about on the campaign trail, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no taxes on Social Security, the immediate expensing of capital investment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're buying capital equipment, if you're buying plants or equipment or software even, you will be able to immediately expense those items.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">From a tax perspective, not an accounting one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's important that those are two separate things, but yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">From a tax perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all of these things get pulled together in this bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of debate and questions out there as to what does this mean, you know, like you add those things up, that's probably a $400 or $500 billion annual stimulus to the economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, I know a lot of people have talked about this, but they got to put a cap on this tax on tips thing because it's going to leave a loophole that everybody and their brother will walk through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it needs to just be some cap that won't hit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's de minimis tips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's de minimis tips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Because otherwise you just redefine your consulting company as all tips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct, correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they already have that in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They've done a lot of work on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember, the two people in the house that are relevant here, you have the speaker, Mike Johnson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You have Jason Smith, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, everybody's relevant, but those are the two leaders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">In the Senate, it's Senator, it's Leader Thune, and it's Mike Crapo, who's the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the House, or in the White House, you have Kevin Hassett and Scott Bessett.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So the six of them, think of them as the big six, they're putting together this package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">They each have a list of their priorities, and then they get together and negotiate those priorities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't even know exactly what's going to be in the House bill yet, let alone what's going to survive in the Senate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But we certainly have the contours of what's going to be in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I saw this morning that the Council of Economic Advisors, which, of course, is in the White House, is saying, yes, although this will increase our spending, our CBO scoring, because the taxes cost money, the tax cuts cost money, it also will lead to much higher economic growth than we would have otherwise had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a normal argument that you see out of those who support tax cuts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And where do you stand?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, of course, we're, you know, higher taxes, lower economic growth, lower taxes, higher economic growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'm firmly in that camp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do worry that, you know, we had just had a $2.2 trillion deficit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we have a $38 trillion debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We all got excited about Elon and Doge being able to cut a lot of costs out of government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But I suspect when you look at this package, right, and again, I'm just saying, based upon how the Congressional Budget Office will score it, and this is kind of arcane scoring, but it will probably increase the deficit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And at best, it would reduce it by $100 or $200 billion, depending upon where our economic growth comes in, Bill, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, if you have higher economic growth, you'll have higher tax revenues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a huge benefit to drive higher economic growth for the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are no big areas where we're taking out $500 billion or $700 billion or a trillion dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2217"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I would love to believe that we're going to grow our economy at 4% or 5% per year

target="_blank">00:39:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but I think that that would be aggressive to forecast that kind of growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We haven't seen that kind of growth in a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">One data point that's kind of interesting, I listened to that same episode and the team at All In was talking about potentially monetizing the balance sheet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is, are there assets that exist on the United States balance sheet that could be turned into offsets for the deficit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that obviously comes up is land.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, living here in Texas, you know, many people probably don't know this, but the university system here was granted as a gift years ago, 2.1 million acres in the Permian Basin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that spits off, I believe, I could have this number wrong, but like $894 million a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the U.S. has way more than 2.1 million acres, but that is an example, I guess, of an endowment-like situation where land is monetized and creates cash flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe there is something to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I would say one thing I was happy to hear the president say over the course of the last couple of weeks, he said, if we do do anything like that, that rather than putting that money in a sovereign wealth fund, we're just going to use it to pay down the debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, so now it sounds like the sovereign wealth fund is on the back burner, which I think is a good idea to put it on the back burner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do think that we ought to have a task force in this country specifically coming up with ideas for how we achieve deficit reduction and debt reduction and monetizing the balance sheet should be one of the things on the list to be discussed, along with other mechanisms to allow us to have permanent, you know, cuts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2503" target="_blank">00:41:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Things like the defense stuff that you're talking about, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think everything has to be on the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2508" target="_blank">00:41:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to come up with a plan that over a reasonable period of time, let's call it 10 years, even like a family, you know, you put them on a path, you start small, and you work your way over a longer period of time toward deficit reduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it is morally unacceptable to saddle our kids with what will be over $50 trillion in debt that we, you know, we effectively increased our quality of living during our lifetimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will only hurt theirs because we're saddling them with that big pile of debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We

class="t">And hopefully we can get it done in the next couple of years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=2548"

of the Stanford Directors College, which I think most people consider to be the number one directors college in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where if you're an independent director, you go and you learn how to be a

one of the most knowledgeable people on the planet when it comes to corporate governance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3030"

classes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">He's just a wonderful individual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He recently, and I mean, May 14th recently, published a piece of research that I think is just super interesting and that everyone needs to understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he highlights is that the award multiples, and apparently there's a thing in business litigation where the judge can decide what multiple of the standard hourly rate a lawyer is able to get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, which is an interesting concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know that anyone else gets awards as a multiple, but I'm sure a lawyer wrote it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And the base rate's pretty high, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, anyway, what he found was he compared a bunch of Delaware judgments with a bunch of judgments in the federal courts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3088" target="_blank">00:51:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And he looked at a bunch of different breakings, but one of the breaks was, you know, what's the frequency of awards seven times or higher?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And what are the frequency of awards ten times or higher?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he found is, in Delaware, seven times or higher is 23 times more likely than in a federal court.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, basically, if you would, you'd say there might be a tale of scenarios where a judgment deserves some kind of outlandish, you know, result, some level of fraud or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But what he's showing is there's an activist mentality in the Delaware courts that they're giving out these super high payouts at a much more frequent, you know, 23 times and 57 times more than at the federal level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the big eye opener to me is, first of all, I would tell everyone to go read this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're sitting on a board of a Delaware court and you're not aware that this, and this is new, these are all cases between 2009 and 2024.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're not aware that this is going on, that the rewards that are being paid out to lawyers, you know, for cases in Delaware are increasing at this level and are being paid out much more frequently at very high payouts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3183" target="_blank">00:53:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, this is, you know, more damning than just the one Tesla thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.940</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Delaware was a place that was supposed to be business calm, where you didn't expect chaos, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This shows that chaos is being built into the system and it's a recent development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">One more thing that I want to highlight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It turns out that in the 20 cases where you have this, this super high multiplier, um, 55% of the cases are just two of the judges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3224" target="_blank">00:53:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, there's something else that, that I learned in reading this, which I didn't know, but the chancellor, um, who is one of the two gets to pick who the cases are assigned to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the chancellor's creating these super high multiples and then the chancellor's in charge of handing cases and, and, and she could hand them to herself or to this other judge who's also doing the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I, I just, I think eyes wide open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I, I read this and I think, you know, any company that I'm involved with, I'm going to encourage to leave, um, because this is radically different than why I was told we were supposed to go to Delaware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3268" target="_blank">00:54:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And, and, and, and, and Bill, these awards go to who they go to the lawyers and they go to whoever the plaintiffs are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, get this. I mean, you, we've talked about this, so I don't need to like pound the table on it, but in the Tesla case, the plaintiff had nine shares.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the plaintiff made zero money on a relative basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and the lawyers made 380 million or 345 or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet you had, you had a plaintiff that, that, that, that didn't get any recovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3296" target="_blank">00:54:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, like, why should we have laws, any, any law in this country, because PAGA works this way in California, where a lawyer gets to come in and make a huge, like, shouldn't, shouldn't the lawyer fee be a small percentage of the plaintiff fee?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Why, why should it be 99% of, of the fee?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3317" target="_blank">00:55:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Makes no sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3319" target="_blank">00:55:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I, I think the significance here is that what you're arguing is what tends to happen is people heard about the Elon case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3328" target="_blank">00:55:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They treat it as a one-off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">They may not have made any changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you're saying is that this was not a one-off in the state of Delaware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a structural problem that has emerged in the state of Delaware, which was the state that everybody went to incorporate it in because they thought it had the most predictability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you have a study that shows not only does it not have the most predictability, it actually has the greatest risk of long tail adverse outcomes to, you know, to the company that are highly unpredictable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would encourage, we'll put the link in there and I'll, I'll, I'll tweet it out after we post the podcast, but I, I would encourage everyone to go read that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3368" target="_blank">00:56:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And following on that and trying to keep with what you just said about speed round last week, you know, the two states people say you should consider other than Delaware, Texas and Nevada.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, last week, Texas state legislature passed a bill, Senate bill 29, trying to improve Texas's position, if you will, in this competition with Nevada on where you should go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just wanted to mention a couple of things that they put in there to, to, to hopefully, you know, make Texas better, which would make everyone better if they choose to incorporate there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the first thing was they codified the business judgment rule there in some of these states, you can hop around the business judgment rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3412" target="_blank">00:56:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">This put a hard line and said, no, you're not supposed to, you can't hop around the business judgment rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and people that know what that means, that's a, that's a positive for businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing they did was the, they, they put a limit on opportunistic legal claims.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of that has to do with, with the multiple point that we talked about, but the big thing they did was in, you can, in your corporate docs, put up, put a minimum threshold of up to 3% on what's needed to bring a derivative action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can basically say, in order to bring a derivative action, you need 3% of the shareholders outstanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this Tesla situation where you basically, you know, just called around and found someone that held nine shares, which is just like ridiculous at face value, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3462" target="_blank">00:57:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Did someone brought a whole case on a plaintiff with nine shares makes no effing sense whatsoever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And this gets rid of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3470" target="_blank">00:57:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think that's huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3472" target="_blank">00:57:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, you're flying the Texas flag and saying, not only is Delaware more capricious than we otherwise thought, more activist than we otherwise thought, but that, in fact, it's leading to new laws in states like Texas and Nevada that are going further distance to try to encourage companies to come there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're giving them predictability, not in the court room, but they're giving them predictability in the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a few more quick things you can, in your documents, you can make it very clear that the new Texas business courts are the only place that you'll have to appear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's some limitations on book and record requests if you've ever been deposed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they grab everything and this will limit that too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's other little things, but those first two things are the big things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I'm really trying to look after everybody and all the startups out there, all the venture-backed companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3533" target="_blank">00:58:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, if Nevada wants to raise the bar and wants to send us some information, I'd be glad to share that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3541" target="_blank">00:59:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the important thing is to get out of Delaware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3544" target="_blank">00:59:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the truth is, Bill, after this case, I will bet you that inertia kicked in and 90-plus percent of companies and lawyers went back to incorporating the state of Delaware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3557" target="_blank">00:59:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that's just the way that momentum and inertia works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">No doubt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3560" target="_blank">00:59:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that it's important that you continue to beat the drum, that people understand, and, you know, we're going to put a link to this study, that people understand that this was not a one-off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the onus, the burden, is on the state of Delaware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we're not trying to unfairly attack the state of Delaware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the onus and burden is on the state of Delaware to explain and make the case as to how they're going to change their system to provide the predictability and the protection that people thought they were getting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that clearly they're not getting there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe to continue on, Bill, in the speed round here, there's been a ton of momentum recently in crypto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And you sent me a paper that was recently written, you know, in this regard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3607" target="_blank">01:00:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Why don't you tell us about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I want to talk for a second about the Genius Act and the stablecoin legislation that took a major step forward last night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I was told to read something, and I'm holding it right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a member of the SEC, Hester Pierce, who all the crypto people love dearly because she's been very outspoken in her support of crypto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">She's actually the longest-serving member of the SEC at this point in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But she put out a paper on May 8th called a Creative and Cooperative Balancing Act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was surprised, you know, and it's not that long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3647" target="_blank">01:00:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone should go read it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's five pages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But she makes a very strong argument that crypto and blockchain specifically may be a better mechanism for tracking securities, including the securization of companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">She goes on to say that, you know, you can have regulatory capture that can unfairly protect people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That regulatory capture may lead to market fragility because you end up with a single player or just two players.</span></div><div

regulatory sandbox, which would mean let some people play around with this before you jump on top of them and kill them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been this huge DL proponent, and I do believe that, you know, the number of public companies, she also brings that up, the number of public companies is way down from its peak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3698" target="_blank">01:01:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That could relate to regulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also think it relates to inefficiency in our markets and our IPO process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I haven't been a big crypto bull, but I'm going to pay attention to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.420</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the genius bill, the genius act, as it's called, which is pretty historic legislation, which effectively crossed a hurdle in the Senate last night that I think now puts it on a fast track to being signed into law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It was led by my friend, Senator Bill Haggerty in the Senate.</span></div><div

this battle to basically say, you know, we've been persecuting now for the last four years, everybody involved in crypto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

auspices and whatever we need in terms of protections, put the protections in the place, and then allow this innovation to occur in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3764" target="_blank">01:02:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the case of stable coins, we know that this could be the next generation of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3779" target="_blank">01:02:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was beginning to develop in other parts of the country or other parts of the world because we had not developed a system that people felt comfortable innovating in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is the legislation requires?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3791" target="_blank">01:03:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, it requires specific reserve backing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So it requires stable coin issuers to maintain reserves equal to the value of their

have this patchwork of people, you know, attacking folks who are trying to innovate in this area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=3811" target="_blank">01:03:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It gives them real certainty as it regards there, puts in place a bunch of consumer

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The one that really caught my eye was there's an article that was about Baidu.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Baidu is scheduled to release the latest version of their model on June 30th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They've pre-announced it for one reason or another, and they've switched to open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4023" target="_blank">01:07:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they talked to Robin Lee, who's been the longtime Baidu founder, I met him back in 2005, 21 years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">he had originally been a proponent of closed models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4035" target="_blank">01:07:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">He had spoken out publicly against that, and people were like, well, why are you going open now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out, you know, DeepSeek led to Quinn, led to Xiaomi has their own model as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">They've all gone open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4049" target="_blank">01:07:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this will be the fourth deep pocket funded model in China that are all open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you consider, I mean, this is a competitive dynamic, right, that leads to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4062" target="_blank">01:07:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you consider that it's already been proven here in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4068" target="_blank">01:07:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that different models can help improve other models, having four simultaneous models out there all open source,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4077" target="_blank">01:07:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think is pretty damn interesting and will be tough to keep up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4083" target="_blank">01:08:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know what America should do about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

Google, followed suit and chased meta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.560</a></span> | <span

class="t">And so just from a country versus country standpoint, boy, I think that's powerful for innovation, for speed, for speed of innovation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4108" target="_blank">01:08:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's super interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4109" target="_blank">01:08:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you know, I do think you're going to see the open AI, open source

capability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4147" target="_blank">01:09:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it does, it appears that everybody in China is dedicated to open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4152" target="_blank">01:09:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the U.S., I certainly hope that we have a open source model that leads the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4158" target="_blank">01:09:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I suspect that we're going to see more of these out of our leading

know, I know I've talked with you a bit about Manus and the background associated with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4206" target="_blank">01:10:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So would you share with us a little bit, you know, your perspectives on Manus and maybe Benchmark's decisions too?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4213" target="_blank">01:10:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4214" target="_blank">01:10:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I was surprised a bunch of people came after me on the socials, as they say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4220" target="_blank">01:10:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And they implied a bunch of deep-seated planning and whatnot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think part of it just comes from, I think, in not being a China hawk, people accuse you of being a xenophile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4237" target="_blank">01:10:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of room in between those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4239" target="_blank">01:10:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But one thing I think these people don't know is that I'm no longer a GP on the new funds at Benchmark, which means I'm not involved in new investment decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I didn't, I wasn't part of the decision to invest in Manus, and I, you know, found out about it after the fact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4256" target="_blank">01:10:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm obviously a big LP at Benchmark, and I'm a GP in the older funds, and I believe Benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4263" target="_blank">01:11:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do support the firm, but some of the theories involved scenarios that just didn't happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But after the fact, I went deep on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4273" target="_blank">01:11:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there are a few things that it would just be good for people to understand about Manus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4279" target="_blank">01:11:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first of all, they've only operated on U.S. models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4282" target="_blank">01:11:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They're a wrapper company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't have a foundational model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And they've only operated on top of U.S. models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4289" target="_blank">01:11:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So they've actually never operated on top of DeepSeek or any of the other models we were just talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4295" target="_blank">01:11:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing is they have offices around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4297" target="_blank">01:11:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They're in Singapore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4298" target="_blank">01:11:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They're in Japan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4299" target="_blank">01:11:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They're in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4300" target="_blank">01:11:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Third, they host all of these on U.S. hosting services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4305" target="_blank">01:11:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they're not actually operating any of their customers' workloads in China at all, at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4314" target="_blank">01:11:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And the data is all resident on those U.S. hosting companies' servers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4319" target="_blank">01:11:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's no customer data in China either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4323" target="_blank">01:12:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think people rush to judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4325" target="_blank">01:12:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I've already spoken about why I think they rush to judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a China hawk tilt among a lot of these people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4332" target="_blank">01:12:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But things aren't always as they seem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4335" target="_blank">01:12:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, the company has some leading agentic technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4339" target="_blank">01:12:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they have some leading browserless, you know, headless browser technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4343" target="_blank">01:12:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And they've got a long list of customers that are excited about what they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4348" target="_blank">01:12:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I just think it's important for people to understand the facts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4351" target="_blank">01:12:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think another thing is, you know, I saw a stat the other day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4355" target="_blank">01:12:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think 50% of researchers, AI researchers, in the United States of America are Chinese.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4360" target="_blank">01:12:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4365" target="_blank">01:12:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what bothers me about this is I think there's a real danger here in a drift, right, that is very xenophobic, right, very anti-China, that is not healthy for our own relationship in terms of desirability to work in America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4382" target="_blank">01:13:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a Chinese background, I think American investors should be free to invest, you know, in companies like Manus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cpSUpdIOs&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.140</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:13:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think attacking firms simply because they're investing in this without full information about what it's about.</span></div><div
