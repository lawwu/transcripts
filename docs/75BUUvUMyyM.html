Now, for those of you who don't know, Lee was my first guest on the podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and he is one of the most knowledgeable people I know when it comes to travel hacking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and really all things travel.

So I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to read it. So Alberto sent an email in and said, "Hey, Chris, love your podcast, and I'd love to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hear more about ultra high-end travel experiences. Even though not every listener can benefit from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">them, certainly many aspire to them, and all of them likely enjoy hearing about these possibilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So to me, that's what options do people have to fly private? How does that compare to first class?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What premium programs aren't advertised that airlines and hotels offer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What kinds of experiences can a great concierge cover, etc.?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can't think of anyone who knows that space better than you.

He plans these experiences. So I thought that would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a fun conversation to have and worth having you back on again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.

I mean, we can definitely dive into the travel lifestyles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of the rich and famous, but I will caveat it by saying a couple of things. Number one is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not all of these experiences are off limits to the not rich and famous. I myself don't think that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">can afford necessarily a private jet, but I've been lucky enough to fly private once or twice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or have these incredible concierge experiences at hotels where if you just know the right angle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then you can really up your travel game, your travel experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So definitely happy to talk about what people pay for, and maybe some other great area where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you can kind of hack your way in. Perfect. The big question out there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">something that I've never booked a private jet.

It was quite the nice experience. What does private</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">jet travel look like? Is it incredibly expensive? Just kind of like set the standard for people on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the experience and how much does it cost? You know, if you had asked me this in our first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">meeting almost a year ago, where we recorded the first podcast, I would have said, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">private aviation is booming. And I would have thought that we were at the very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">very peak of the market. Like the stock market, private aviation's market has gone even higher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">since then. So right now private is very expensive and it's exclusive, right? You have your own jet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to yourself, unless you're lucky enough to be invited on somebody else's jet for a short hop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere. But because of that, and because of gas prices and just the demand on the market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it is incredibly expensive. But the question is, how do you go about finding A, a jet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">B, a deal on a jet?

Well, it's going to fly empty. And so the way to fly private for cheap,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">not for free, but for cheap to hack it, is to find an empty leg that works for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, operators of those private empty legs are savvy.

Generally speaking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not something that I see on a lot of midsize or smaller jets because there's really no need,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">especially because those jets have a limited mission size. They're going on a four or five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hour trip maybe at most. You don't really need service during that time. One of the things I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">find so interesting about flying private is that generally the cockpit door is open. So you can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at any kind of point in the flight, you can stroll on in and be like, "How we doing folks?" And sit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">down on a jump seat and take a look at the instrumentation and see how the plane is flown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that to me is probably one of the coolest parts of flying private is that you're with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">crew.

And that's really lovely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because you get to feel like you're part of the operation if you choose to do so. If you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">privacy and you want to be locked back in your cabin, no problem.

So when people who would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise fly private are flying commercially, I know there's actually some experiences you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have at the airport, changing planes when you land that maybe we've casually seen as normal travelers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">someone holding a sign or something at the airport.

And the other is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">less accessible to all. So the greeters, those people who are holding the placards when you land</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and who are not associated maybe with a wheelchair, are there waiting for a VIP. There are people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are greeting you at the jet bridge of your aircraft when you arrive.

It's on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">opposite side of the airport from the passenger terminal to the south side.

One is a salon where it's sort of open to a smaller group of the public. And the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is a private suite, which is just open to you. Prices are pretty steep. They start in the 500s</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and go to 5000s per use per person.

And then I looked it up. And I think it was I could be really wrong here. But it was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">$80. Yeah, it was not like not expensive $5,000.

I'm gonna ask a question that has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing to do with super high end. But I was flying back from Bora Bora on United. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this was the first time I ever noticed this new cabin. I think they call it premium plus. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">feel like for a long time, there was premium economy and then it was gone. And then all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">airlines domestically started adding economy plus and comfort plus, which was basically coach with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a little more legroom and maybe some extra snacks, right? And I saw premium plus and the flight was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">empty. There was one person in all maybe 30 seats, but it looked pretty nice. Is premium economy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">coming back? And for people trying to really maximize dollars or miles? Is it a pretty viable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">option? How does it compare to business or first? This is a great question. So premium economy is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. And it is also a super confusing thing, because airlines have done a terrible job of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">distinguishing what is an actual premium economy cabin versus what's a premium economy seat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, on United, there is economy plus, which they used to call their premium economy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">seat until they actually put in a premium economy cabin. Premium plus, right? So confusing. And all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of these, like, it just doesn't make any sense as a consumer. When you're looking at it, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like, where am I sitting? What am I seeing? What am I paying for? How do I upgrade into this? It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">just too much. So I like to think of it this way. Whenever you're flying internationally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ideally transoceanically, there is going to be a premium economy cabin, a separate cabin with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">fancier seats. They're not lie flat. It's not a business class, but it might feel like a domestic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">business class on a, you know, lazy boy kind of seat, right? You've got a little more recline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a little more leg room. On the United flights, it's usually a 2-3-2 seating, whereas in economy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in the back, it's 3-4-3 or 3-3-3, very crowded. So you feel more spacious up there. There's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">better premium version of food. You earn more miles for those seats, et cetera. So there is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">separate cabin for that. Again, it's not going to be seen outside of a couple of domestic routes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">where they're flying those bigger craft to reposition them. It's not going to be seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">domestically. Now, confusingly, they will market domestically sometimes their economy plus seating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">as premium economy. Delta is notorious for this. When you fly from JFK to San Francisco, they will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">market their, what they call Delta Comfort as, which is their economy plus, as a premium economy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">cabin. It's not, it's still just an economy seat with a little bit extra leg room. So we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">literally about two very separate cabins, very separate experiences. As of right now, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">airlines haven't really figured out how to optimize their mileage game when it comes to redemption</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for those premium plus, the actual cabin premium economy seats. So what I would always recommend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is looking to upgrade into them. Book an economy ticket and see what the mileage upgrade cost would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">be to actually upgrade into that premium cabin. It's often fairly affordable. United sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">charges 10 or 20 plus points per leg if you have those plus points. Whereas other airlines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the price differential is so high. It's almost like a mid-tier between economy and business class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">when you pay for it. But when you actually use mileage to upgrade, it's not that expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And one thing we didn't mention that I think is a, for anyone using miles to travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">internationally, a important thing to remember. If you're just, if you've never flown business class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">internationally, then there are two things that are interesting. One, the trans-oceanic flight is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be a next level experience. It's the best. It's, it's, it's, I almost say, make sure that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have enough points to do it again. Because if you just do it once, you're going to want to do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">every time. The small, short routes are awful. They're terrible. Yeah. Intra-European business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">class is not business class.

We, when we went to Greece last year, we were like, Oh, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">did, we found seats.

So that's flights. We hit a lot of stuff. I want to talk about hotels because I feel like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot more mystery here a little bit.

And there's, in my opinion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a little harder.

What is the high-end of luxury hotels look like?

One from the very face of it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">price, right?

If you have the means to do it, then absolutely, I would do it. I wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">always limit it to just money. So let's use a concierge, and let's just say Paris, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a couple of different ways of taking care of that concierge. Number one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3401" target="_blank">00:56:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have developed via email a relationship with a particular concierge, before you arrive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3406" target="_blank">00:56:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the things you can do is write a note to the general manager and say, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Laurent has been amazing.

So that's number one. Number two is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, bring them a gift. Bring them some little goody and to say, "Thank you." So that might mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that you buy, you know, la durée macaron the moment you arrive at Paris Charles de Gaulle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3440" target="_blank">00:57:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Airport and you have your VIP greeter stop you for a second to buy them.

I like to tip concierges</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3462" target="_blank">00:57:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">at the beginning of a stay, which will always help ensure wonderful service.

What are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">giving them? It's really up to you. There is no guide. I was talking with a hotelier in Paris,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, and he said to me, "We've got some clients who tip, you know, 20 euro a day and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they give it at the front. And if the concierge has gone above and beyond while they're there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3485" target="_blank">00:58:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they give them a little bit more at the end, another 20 or 50 euro." I know one guy who just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3490" target="_blank">00:58:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">tips $1,000 wherever he goes when he gets there because he can do that.

So it really depends on what you want to do. But any token of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">gratitude and appreciation is always appreciated, including just a simple email before and after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the stay saying, "Hey, you did a great job.

But I guess my question was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">can tipping ever unlock something, right? Can you walk into a restaurant and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3515" target="_blank">00:58:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, tip the hostess and get a table that you wouldn't otherwise gotten?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3519" target="_blank">00:58:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I've often heard tipping the person checking you in in Vegas gets you a nicer room. Have you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">had experience with those things?

It just depends on what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the local custom is. In Japan, that might seem very odd to receive a tip at check-in from someone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3547" target="_blank">00:59:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right? But if you wrote them a lovely note and handed it to them with two hands at check-in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that might be a different story, right?

So that's also useful to know, is that American United, they used to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Delta, for a little while, they used to give you these certificates.

But if they have a physical thing you can give away, that goes miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BUUvUMyyM&t=3659" target="_blank">01:00:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.
