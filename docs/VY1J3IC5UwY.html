He gives an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">anecdote about getting involved in a pylon.

Very clear writing. He says you could in this situation quit or turn off Twitter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but he says in theory, you can just log on, wait for it to end, but no one does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

People were starting to use Twitter to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">about things that were happening and ideas that were interesting, not just what they felt like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or what was happening to them.

And when Musk took over, the journalist, especially for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">mainstream left-leaning journalist said, "This party, we're at this nice dinner party." And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">was getting kind of raucous. And then the host said, "By the way, I sold my apartment to someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't like and now it's his dinner party."

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1J3IC5UwY&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">think this is all healthier.
