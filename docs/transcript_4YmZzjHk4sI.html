But what's the case for supporting established businesses? I think people misunderstand where a small business typically, not in every case, but at least in the cases where we denote them startups, there's usually an embedded innovation and the innovation is kind of all that the company is.</p><p>Like they have a new idea and they're going to do something better or different or, you know, whatever. And so, you know, generally speaking, we like innovation. And so we've, you know, positive sentiments towards that startup. But there's a lot of innovation that comes from large established businesses. That's not all they do.</p><p>You know, there's also just running the existing thing. And so maybe it's a smaller share, but the aggregate fraction of innovation that comes from established businesses is really large. And, you know, we have to be cognizant of the cognitive bias of the startups perhaps being somewhat more conspicuous. You choose any sector of the economy and a significant fraction of the important, you know, inventions that occurred over the last 10 or 20 years will have come from the incumbents.</p><p>And so I think as a general class and, you know, Tyler, of course, wrote a book on this, I think big business is underrated. I think it's true that established businesses tend to pay better. They tend to be more efficient. More of the innovation in our economy comes from them and they produce a lot of consumer surplus.</p><p>Maybe a lot of the tech industry doesn't place a lot of value on process and operational excellence. You know, we kind of culturally value the spontaneous and the creative and the iconoclastic and the path breaking, but building mechanisms that can enable the very reliable provision of important services at scale and, you know, removing the sources of variability that can really cause a bad day for a very large number of people.</p><p>I don't think they get quite as much cultural credit. I mean, if you think about just like the big trends in society that are needed to solve our big problems, right? Like Moore's law or the cost of solar or something, these are just, you have marginal improvements over many decades that the big tech or big companies are just able to invest a lot of money into doing the R&D here.</p><p>Relentless iterative improvement, yes, is underrated. When we think about the way in which Stripe will continue to grow in the future, in some sense it'll obviously involve a lot of big businesses and, you know, you're now processing a significant amount of Amazon volume versus other businesses you're doing deals with.</p><p>First, tell me how you think, it kind of makes sense how an exponentially growing startup would contribute to exponentially growing growth for a Stripe. How does like, does Stripe keep growing in the same trajectory when it's these existing big businesses that you're partnering with? You know, Stripe is doomed to eventually grow at the rate of the economy.</p><p>There is just a question of, you know, how long it takes to get that right.</p></div></div></body></html>
