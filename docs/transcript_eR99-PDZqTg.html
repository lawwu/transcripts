I think it has actually the potential to have a profound impact in changing how our civilization looks at AI and robotics because this is the first time human beings, people that don't own a Tesla, may have never seen a Tesla or heard about a Tesla, get to watch hundreds of thousands of cars without a driver. - Yeah. - Do you see it this way, almost like an education tool for the world about AI? Do you feel the burden of that, the excitement of that, or do you just think it's a smart parking feature? - I do think you are getting at something important, which is most people have never really seen a robot and what is the car that is autonomous? It's a four-wheeled robot. - Right. - Yeah, it communicates a certain sort of message with everything from safety to the possibility of what AI could bring. It's current limitations, it's current challenges, it's what's possible. Do you feel the burden of that, almost like a communicator, educator to the world about AI? - We're just really trying to make people's lives easier with autonomy, but now that you mention it, I think it will be an eye-opener to people about robotics because they've really never seen, most people have never seen a robot and there are hundreds of thousands of Teslas, won't be long before there's a million of them, that have autonomous capability and the drive without a person in it. And you can see the kind of evolution of the car's personality and thinking with each iteration of autopilot. You can see it's uncertain about this, or it gets, but now it's more certain. Now it's moving in a slightly different way. Like I can tell immediately if a car is on Tesla autopilot 'cause it's got just little nuances of movement, it just moves in a slightly different way. It's, cars on Tesla autopilot, for example, on the highway are far more precise about being in the center of the lane than a person. If you drive down the highway and look at how, where cars are, the human driven cars are within their lane, they're like bumper cars, they're like moving all over the place. The car in autopilot, dead center. (wind whooshing) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (Thanks for watching)</p></div></div></body></html>
