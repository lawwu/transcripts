I feel like it's like asking you to pick your favorite child, right? I've done 200 episodes now, which by the way, we never really celebrated because we just put out an episode as number 200. So I don't think I could pick one because as I, I just scrolled through the list right in front of me and I was like, Oh man, I'd love that takeaway from talking about negotiation.</p><p>That was super meaningful. If you ask which one I recommend the most, I often recommend people check out the Arthur Brooks episode. I did about happiness because I think it just kind of opened my eyes to a topic. I hadn't thought about a lot and this is a bit of a weird answer, but the research I did for the points versus cashback episode was really meaningful to me because it really twisted my mindset on the value of points and it's just kind of changed the way I think about a lot of things.</p><p>Sometimes when I do a solo episode, it's not the end result that is so powerful. It's the fact that I did 30, 40, 50 hours of research going into it.</p></div></div></body></html>
