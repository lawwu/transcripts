It's basically the fundamental way we get people better is start with healing the gut because everything starts in the gut from things that are obvious like digestive issues all the way from autism to Alzheimer's from heart disease to cancer to asthma to obesity.</p><p>All these things are related to the gut microbiome even from schizophrenia to depression to anxiety to OCD all can be related to changing the microbiome. And so we're this frontier of microbiome research that is now helping us understand how critical the microbiome is in every aspect of our health.</p><p>And yet, unfortunately, doctors don't pay attention to it. Don't do anything about it. Don't focus on it because they don't learn about it. But it's fundamental to the functional practice of functional medicine and what we've been doing for decades. So learning how to take care of your microbiome tending your inner garden is one of the most essential things you do.</p><p>And I've written about this in many of my books particularly young forever. I talked about it and how to keep your gut healthy. So it's an essential feature and just by eating the right foods.</p></div></div></body></html>
