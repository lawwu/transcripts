So for example, Plaza Premium operates lounges for a number of airlines and things like that around the world. The club operates the Chase Sapphire lounges, for example.</p><p>But a lot of times they won't make that really well known. The Virgin Atlantic Lounge, for example, Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse, a lot of them are operated by Plaza Premium. And you can actually get into those with Plaza Premium. If you have a car that offers Plaza Premium access, you can get into a Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse.</p><p>But they don't really do a lot of advertising. It's not very common to buy access to it directly or something like that. So it's not the same as like a priority pass. But there are definitely networks of companies out there that will operate lounges on behalf</p></div></div></body></html>
