Capital M is where some person is assigned to you, they're going to imbue some magical phrase or saying or thing, and all of a sudden everything is going to work out for you. That form of Capital M Mentoring doesn't exist and has never worked for those that have tried it.</p><p>The thing that's really productive is Small M Mentoring. And that happens when you model behaviors of really smart people and really capable people, really ethical people. And again, that happens because you're seeing them on a day to day basis, not just in a meeting, but in the gaps between meeting, they'll include you in certain things, or you'll have lunch with them.</p><p>And this is what I mean by all of these people that are looking for an accelerant in their career, they've robbed themselves of the most powerful accelerant possible, which is capable people to surround themselves with, they are going to look back on these decisions and they're going to regret them.</p></div></div></body></html>
