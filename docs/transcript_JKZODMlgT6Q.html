So we have a question here from Sam. Sam asks, do you have any advice for jack of all trades type people who want to become so good they can't ignore you? Well, my typical advice for that question is go read my friend, Dave Epstein's book range. Range is all about this. It's about all the benefits of having multiple different skills. It's about the serendipity that can unfold down the road where you don't really know where you're going, but this skill plus that skill plus this skill combined to be something that was really uniquely valuable. And I think he does a really great job of talking about how this jack of all trades approach can work. The thing I will add, and Dave and I talked about this when it came on my show, you can find an older episode where we, where I interviewed Dave and we talked about this is that even if you're doing a generalist or jack of all trades approach, you still have to get good at the individual things. You still have to get to what we called in that interview, the non amateur level. That is the table stakes for a skill to potentially be useful in some sort of unique combination going forward. In my book, so good, they can't ignore you. I talked about this as well. And I called it the auction market of career capital, where you build up career capital in several different areas and the combination is unique. And then you can apply that unique combination to get cool things in your career. Same idea. You still have to build the capital. You still have to get good. So if you want to combine a master's degree in science with the ability to write like Dave Epstein did, he still went through and got the master's degree in science that was time consuming, and he still learned how to write by building his way up from entry level positions, the higher and higher level positions. And then those two things came together and he could do science writing in a very interesting way. So that's the only thing I would say. You don't have to just have one skill that you're trying to master and be the best in the world. That is one approach. It's not the only approach. It's fine to build up a collection of skills that might come together in interesting ways. Just keep in mind that you still have to build the skill. There's no, no shortcut in getting good at something. If you're not good at something, it basically doesn't count. It's not a tool in your toolbox. So you don't have to be the world's best scientist to bring a science skill over to your writing career and have it help, but you also have to do more than just read one book on science. You actually gonna have to do some hard work, maybe get a degree, really learn what's going on. So that's what I would say there. Get non-bad, leave the amateur level. Then you have something you can play with.</p></div></div></body></html>
