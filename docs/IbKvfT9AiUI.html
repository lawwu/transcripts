I've shared some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of that in the 55 different solo episodes I've done, which I'm really enjoying.

So keep those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">coming and some of the hacks you've picked up and you share. I love doing that as well. So in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">episode, I decided I was going to go back in time and find my top 50 hacks from the entire journey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">spanning travel, points and miles, money, investing, productivity, relationships, and a lot more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So these aren't just going to be generic tips.

Others might be big mindset shifts, but I think all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">them are grounded in action. And I really hope that at least a few of them become a part of your own life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy. Also throughout this episode, there are going to be a lot of references to other episodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll include links to all of them in the show notes. And just so you know, when I mentioned an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">episode number, it serves two purposes. One, if you're on the podcast app, it makes it easy to scroll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">back in time. The episode number should be in the little summary for each one. But also if you go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">allthehacks.com slash 91, it'll jump straight to episode 91. So you can always use that number as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">way to get to the episode page where on that episode page, you can find links to the episode</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">in your favorite podcast app or YouTube. So I'm going to start with travel, which I'll split into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">credit card points and miles side first, and then general travel after. So the first thing is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">welcome bonuses always win. So it's fun to sometimes think about what credit card is the best one for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">earning the most cashback or points or whatever you want. When it comes to a category, you spend a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">on like dining. But I think the most important thing to remember is that there is hardly a welcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus on a new card that earns anything less than 5%. I would say the actual average of the top welcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">bonuses when I did the analysis for episode 170, which was about cashback versus points, was around 17x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">points on the average welcome bonus. And not the average of all welcome bonuses, but the average I think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the top 10 or 20 at the time. So yes, you can earn 4x points on dining or 5x points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">on flights. But the average welcome bonus is going to give you 17x points on all of your spend on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">card up until you hit that minimum spend. So welcome bonuses always win. The next one is that in math,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we've learned from the time we were kids that 1 plus 1 equals 2. But in the points game, 1 plus 1 is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely able to be more than 2. And that's because you can play this game with your spouse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">your partner, your parents, your family, your friends, your children. And in addition to both earning welcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">bonuses, when you refer people, you can usually for many card issuers earn a referral bonus as well. So if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">going to say open a card that had a 80,000 point bonus, and then refer your partner to a card that also had an 80,000 point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus, you could get not only the 160 plus maybe 20,000 points for the referral. I'm using some round numbers to make this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">easy, but it's somewhere in that order of magnitude. It also means that you can take advantage of a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">huge opportunity multiple times. If you were playing this game with a partner, maybe you were also helping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">your parents. That's four people that could take advantage of a 100,000 point welcome bonus, not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one, plus any referrals that stack on top of that. So I know one of the pieces of pushback I get a lot of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">here is that if you open up tons and tons of cards, you go for welcome bonuses, you do it with your partner, what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that going to do to your credit? In episode 221, I did a deep dive on credit and credit scores. But one of the highlights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll share is from a story from someone who posted online pretty publicly, but said they opened 26 credit cards in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">2017. And the entire time they tracked their credit score for them and their partner, not only did the two of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">accumulate 2 million points, but their credit scores both went up and his partner's score went up by over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">100 points. And they ended this in the high 700, low 800 range, starting from below that for both of them. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not necessarily something that will ruin your credit. In fact, in many cases, it will improve it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The next one is that every one of us can be a travel agent. And I say this because one of the challenges with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">earning points and miles is that most of us don't want to keep spending more and more money that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">don't need to spend. So what I love doing is anytime I'm taking a trip with family or friends, or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a reunion or a bachelor party or even something at work, I've always volunteered to be the travel agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for the group. I'll book the hotels, I'll book the flights, and I'll go as far as to reach out to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">airline and try to get a group fare or the same thing with the hotel. Turns out most people hate doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of work. I'm guessing if you're listening to this podcast, maybe you like that. And if that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">true, this gives you an opportunity to say, I will take all that logistical overhead off of all of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">plates. All I ask for in return is I'm going to book it all on my card. And then I'm going to ask you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to Venmo, Zelle, PayPal, whatever it is, the cost of that trip. I've used that to get lots and lots of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">travel bookings on my cards that weren't necessarily for me and accumulate a ton of points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The next big one in the points and miles world is to take advantage of award search tools and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">their alerts. In episode 166 and 167, Greg from The Frequent Miler and I went down and looked at every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">single hotel and flight booking service there is out there. So I'm not going to recap all of them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but these tools have gotten so good and made it so easy for you to really maximize your points that if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not using them and you have points and miles, I think you're really doing yourself a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">disservice. And there's a massive opportunity for you to take advantage of tools that make it so easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to find flights that can give you such outsized value for your points. I know in a couple weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to do an episode on probably somewhere around 15 or 20 different award search tricks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to make it easier for you to book flights with points and miles. One of those is award search tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but we'll cover a lot of things. And then the other thing is these tools also come with alerting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So not only does it make it easy to say, help me find a flight from California to Asia, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">help me set an alert so that if a better price comes up or a better route comes up, you can send me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">notification and I can rebook it or book it then. Next one is not all of us have points. Some of us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">have been playing the cashback game for a really long time. Some of us just find an amazing points deal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but don't have the points to do it. Well, you can buy points. In episode 170, I did cashback versus points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and talked about the difference between the two. And one of the biggest takeaways for me is that points go on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sale all the time. And so there are opportunities to buy points, even if you don't have them. So my favorite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">example of this is we stayed at this incredible resort called Caprocot in the island of Majorca in Spain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's part of the small luxury hotel group. And that's part of Hilton. And so Hilton had this hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">available for 120,000 points a night. Now, the cash rate was something around $3,000. So already, this is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing value for Hilton points, which are often considered worth around half a cent or $600. So this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is like five times the normal value. But not everyone has 120,000 Hilton points. And yes, you can transfer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from Amex, but maybe you don't have points that can go to Hilton. Well, at the very time we were booking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this, Hilton points were on sale, something that happens at least six to 12 times a year, if not more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">frequently. And so you could just go to the Hilton website, buy 120,000 points for half a cent each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">or $600, and then immediately book that hotel. So if you're ever on a hotel site searching for hotels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">even if you don't have enough points to use, you might as well toggle that little thing that says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">use points and see what the points price is. And if you notice that the points price is such a better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">deal, take a look at buying those points if you don't already have them, because there are sometimes big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunities there. The same thing is true with airlines. I know Avianca LifeMiles, which is a Star</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Alliance partner of Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, they often have points on sale for such an incredible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">price that if you were to find an amazing flight on United going to Europe, there's a decent chance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that if you were to buy Avianca LifeMiles points, you could get a way cheaper price than the cash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">price for that flight, especially if it's like a long haul international business class flight. So keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that in mind anytime you find a great deal with points, or maybe you want to look for a great deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">with points, even if you don't have them. Next is making sure you take advantage of all the credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">card benefits that you have. Now, some of the most common ones are purchase protection,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things break. Your credit card company will often cover that. Lots of travel protections depending on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the card. I did an episode a few years ago, number 113, that went through all the different hidden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits of your credit card. But I realized in prepping this episode, that one was a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">out of date. So I'm going to be redoing that episode in the coming weeks. So keep an eye out for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that. But there are so many benefits and I would be blown away if almost every single person listening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't go download their guide to benefits from their card issuer. If it's a Visa card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there might be a Visa Infinite or Visa Signature or MasterCard World Elite. Not only look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits that come with your card, but go to the MasterCard World Elite website, go to the Visa</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Infinite site and look at those benefits. There are all kinds of things you might not know existed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, the one I'll share right now is gone. But for a while, having a Visa Signature or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Infinite card included wine tasting two-for-ones in Sonoma County. So just all kinds of crazy benefits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that you won't know until you look. And then the last points in Miles 1 is that if you are active</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">duty military or a spouse of someone who is active duty military, and depending on the issuer, that may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">include reserves, you can get most of your credit card fees completely waived. And I know this firsthand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">because a listener emailed me a copy of both their earning summary from their active duty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">in the reserves, as well as a spreadsheet of all the credit card annual fees that were getting waived</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because of it. And both numbers were somewhere around $7,000 or $9,000. But the funny part was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">they were actually getting more fees waived than they were getting paid to be a reservist. So it basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">more than doubled their income from that perspective. Now, they probably wouldn't have had all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">credit cards if the fees weren't getting waived. But there are some cards that have free nights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">free hotel credits, priority pass, global entry, clear, all kinds of benefits and perks. And so if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">those fees are getting waived, it can be a huge, huge benefit for anyone who serves or is married to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">someone who does. Okay, moving on from credit cards, let's talk general travel. And this is more of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">mindset shift from episode 187 with my good friend Lee Rowan. We talked in that episode about a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of travel planning tips and hacks. But one that keeps sticking with me is asking the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">are you planning the trip or is the trip planning you? And there are lots of times in this world where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we see a deal or we find this awesome thing. And it's not necessarily a bad thing if you find an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing flight deal or a hotel deal and want to build your entire trip around it. But just make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you're conscious about what you're doing. Because sometimes we get down in this rabbit hole where we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">start finding a deal and the next deal and all of a sudden we're building a trip. But we never pause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to step back and say, is this actually the trip we want to take? And I've found myself in that situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a few times. And so my new mindset is think in advance whether this is a trip where we want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">very intentional about the kind of trip or where we just want to get out. And we're okay letting the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">deal or the opportunity plan the trip for us. Here's a small quick one, but it's really fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's actually a company that built an entire business around it, which is that you can reverse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">image search places on Airbnb or VRBO and find other places that property is being rented. So you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">just go take the image, go to Google image search and put the image from the Airbnb site or the Vrbo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">site and search for it. But there's a website, hichee.com that does this for you. You can paste</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the link from Airbnb and they'll go and see if they can find that property somewhere else for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to book. I've never used that site. I have no affiliation with them, but I just want to share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">because they've kind of productized this functionality. And when we were going to Paris,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we found a vacation rental and then we were able to find another place to get the exact same property</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for about 20% less that wasn't going through Airbnb. And I presume had less fees for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">person who owned it. Now, another one is that once you book something online, you can monitor for price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">drops. And so you could do this for rental cars, hotel prices, airline fares, and there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">different sites that do this. You can go to Google flights and set a price alert. And so if the fare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">drops, you'll get an alert. You can do that whether you've bought the flight or not. There's a great car</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">rental site I love to use called Auto Slash. I had the founder on talking about ways to get rental car</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">deals. But even if you don't use them to book a rental car, you can go tell them, here's my rental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">car summary. Here's how much I'm paying. And if they find a better deal, they'll message you and you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">basically go and rebook it. And since lots of rental cars are cancelable, it's pretty easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They launched something called Hotel Slash, which does the same thing for hotels. There's a service</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">called Autopilot that will monitor, I think, United, Delta, and American flights. And so if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the fare drops on any of those flights that you've booked, not only will they let you know that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">dropped, but they're actually going to go out and rebook the flight for you so that you don't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">have to think about it. Now they do take, I think, 25% of the savings. So keep that in mind, but they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">will go out and just say, we'll monitor your flight. And if the fare changes, we'll just rebook it for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And you won't even, you'll get a flight credit for the difference or a refund if you booked a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">refundable fare. TripIt also does something very similar. They don't charge you a fee or do it for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you, but they will send you an email and say, hey, we noticed this fare dropped. You could rebook it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">save. And that's something that depending on the airline can be really easy to really difficult to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">do. Some of them like Southwest, it's often as easy as just changing your flight to that same flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and then getting a credit right away. Now those credits do expire now. They used to not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So keep that in mind. But I always say, if you book a flight for $200 and you can change it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">$150 version of the same flight and get a $50 credit, even if you don't use the credit, it didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">cost you anything. So you might as well do it. Now, similar to not just getting a better deal on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">price.

And I won't say you're not asking for an upgrade,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but essentially you're sending an email that says, hey, I'm really excited to stay at your hotel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's who we are.

So they want to treat customers with a ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">hospitality and try to build a long-term relationship.

Obviously, I love free. I love saving a deal. They're not really free because almost every time, if you had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">great experience, I would strongly encourage you to tip the tour guide. That's how they make their money. But it turns out that people who make their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">money off tips really try hard to do a good job to earn those tips. And I've had amazing experiences with our family going on these free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">walking tours in other cities. And we love doing it right when we get somewhere in a city we've never been to. And it kind of helps to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">orient yourself in the city. And you get to ask questions about what should I do while I'm here and get some inspiration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I love that. And then the last one when traveling is something we talked about way, way back in episode five with Scott Kyes, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">started a newsletter way back in the day called Scott's Cheap Flights that turned into a whole company now called Going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talked about the peak end rule. And it's just something I try to think about when traveling. And it's this idea that the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that you remember after a trip is the peak, the highlight, and the last thing. So I always try to make sure that we do something really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">memorable towards the end of a trip, because that's just how our brains work. You know, we're going to remember this, this really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">big highlight moment of the trip, which of course we are, but we're also going to usually remember the end of the trip more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the other parts. So save something special for the end, try to make a magical thing happen somewhere in the middle, and maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">make magic happen every day, of course. But I try to remember the peak end rule when I'm trying to lay out an itinerary for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">trip. So that's travel. I wasn't counting off numbers, but we're at 14 right now. And next, I want to jump into money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a topic that I love talking about. And I've broken down the money section into two buckets. One is on expenses. So how do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">save money and spend less money? And then one is on investments and income. So how do you generate more money or invest your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">money and grow better? So on the expenses side, the first one is to audit and reduce your bills regularly. So one great example, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">episode 104, I talked at length about specifically just insurance policies, making sure you're going through and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">repricing both with your current carrier or potentially with other carriers. I have found that almost every time I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">gone and done that, I've found some way to get something comparable or better for less money. And I think the current</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">total is $14,000 that I've heard of one listener wrote in and said, I went through the process you outlined in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that episode. And I saved $14,500. It's one of the quotes on the website that just listening to one episode</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">saved them that much money because they found that they're wildly overpaying for insurance, probably had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">very nice home or car to save that much on insurance. It's more than I think most of us are paying on our home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">or auto insurance or definitely not so much that there's a margin for that. But nonetheless, awesome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. But I do this with all bills. We all have probably talked or had a conversation about doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this with Comcast or your cable bill. But just something to keep in mind all the time that if there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">regular bills you have to pay, you should audit them. And one of the bills that I'd really encourage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you to push back is a medical bill. So if you want to go back and listen to episode 34, Marshall Allen and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I went deep on the process of negotiating your medical bills. And from his experience talking to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds of people, I would say it's almost certain that if you have a high medical bill that you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">think is correct, you can push back and fight it on number of different ways. We walked through some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of them. He also wrote a book about this process. And I would be surprised if you weren't able to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">almost any medical bill reduced. Or if you're paying out of pocket, make sure you tell the health</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">provider that and they often have cash prices. It's just a great opportunity to cut a bill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">significantly down. I know I had one bill where I was trying to be charged for an out of network doctor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that was working at an in network hospital. And I pushed back. And sure enough, I was able to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that covered. Now, one of the biggest expenses most of us have is on housing, whether we're renters or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">owners. There are so many different ways to hack our houses. And if you go back to episode 14,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we talked all about house hacking. I have done this at various stages of my life. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">our first home purchase was actually a three bedroom condo. But we bought a specific unit that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">had a separate entrance in one of the bedrooms that had its own ensuite bathroom. And we changed the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">doorknob that connected that room to the house to turn it into a studio, rented it out, and we're able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to significantly subsidize the cost of owning that condo. So much so that we could buy something that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">bigger than we needed at the time. And then as we grew, the family had a child, we were able to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">back that room. And we went from a two to a three bedroom condo without actually having to change homes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">because it had basically gone from a two bedroom with a rental to a three bedroom that we had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We changed the doorknob so that we couldn't lock ourselves in and everything worked really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That is not the only way to house hack. We went deep on that episode. But if you're looking to offset</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that expense in your life, there are so many ways to do it. And I definitely encourage you to listen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">if that's something that's interesting. Also in the home, many, many different states, counties, and utility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">companies give you ways to save by changing your energy plan. And so this might not be valid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">everywhere in the country. Some places, there's just a fixed price for energy, and that's it. But I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">here in the Bay Area with PG&E, there's like five, six different plans. And depending on which one you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pick and when you use your energy, especially if you have an electric vehicle, you can get wildly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">different bills. And so in episode 135, Matt Farrell and I talked deeply about all the different ways to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">make your home more energy efficient. But not only do you want to make your home energy efficient,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to look at changing your energy plan to see if you can pay less. Next is probably one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">biggest mindset shifts. And it's going to be very hard to do it justice in a short period of time in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">this episode. But it's adopting a die with zero mindset. So back in episode 91, which I think might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">been the most popular episode of all time, I sat down with Bill Perkins, who wrote a book called die</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with zero. And the general principle of the book is that you should focus on net fulfillment over net</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">worth, meaning, how do you get the most out of life, not how do you accumulate the most amount of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the most important things to think about is, if you live your life in various seasons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">there are seasons where it might make more sense to spend and do things than it does to save. And if you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the data, many people in retirement don't spend nearly as much as they thought, often because they saved all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">these adventures and travels and ideas for retirement. But it turns out that some of those things we just can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">physically do when we're older. So if you have a dream to go hike Mount Kilimanjaro, waiting till you're 75 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">retired might be the worst time to do it. And so before that episode, I probably had this mindset</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of the only goal in life is to increase net worth.

After that interview, almost on a dime, I thought, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not the goal this year.

Then we talked again a couple of years ago about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">money and relationships. And we're actually going to be talking in a few months about a recap on all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this and thinking about how my perspective on money rules and living your rich life has evolved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But to give you a couple of concrete examples, he creates rules that make decisions really easy with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">money. So for example, never question spending money on books, appetizers, and donating to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">friend's charity fundraiser. And it might seem so obvious, but I think we've all been in a situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">where there's some kind of purchase where we're like, oh, this book I heard was really good. Should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I buy it? Well, it's $19. His idea was, let's take a category of things that I have a strong opinion on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and create a rule so that I never have to think about it. For him, business class on flights over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">four hours. For us, we don't have that rule. I've taken plenty of longer than four hour flights in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">economy. But if we're crossing an ocean overnight, we use points to fly business. And we've never been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1736" target="_blank">00:28:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in a situation yet where we couldn't find the ability to use points. So we haven't had to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">out what we do if that were to mean buying business class flights at face value. But we have a similar-ish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">rule. And so he's got a ton of them. I'll put a link in the show notes to a blog post he wrote about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">some of those money rules. We'll talk about them a bit in a few months. But setting money rules and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">creating them with your partner or yourself have been super impactful for us. The next one is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">just negotiate almost everything. And I don't want to sound like someone who's, you know, I'm not in at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a restaurant asking if I can get a discount on, you know, the dinner I'm having. But there are so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things in life, your salary, your Airbnb. I didn't realize until talking with a few Airbnb owners that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people negotiate Airbnbs all the time. I felt like I was a sucker having never done it. And so one time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">we were looking to book this Airbnb, and I actually found a property that had only the number of nights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we needed available in their calendar. So I knew, you know, if you have five nights open, someone could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">book three or four or two, but we wanted to book the whole five. And I reached out and said, look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we found a lot of properties. There are a few others that are a little bit similar, but cheaper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We really liked yours. We want to book the exact five nights that fill your calendar. Could you do it for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">X price? It was definitely less than the list price. Instant, like within hours. Yes, totally. And we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">booked it. So that's one. If you haven't started negotiating your salary, we've talked about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in a bunch of different episodes. You should definitely consider that. We've gotten so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">emails from people who've managed to negotiate their salary, negotiate their co-workers' salaries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and all kinds of stuff. If you're on a website buying something, go to the live chat. You might not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">be negotiating the price, but you could ask, hey, are there any deals right now? Are there any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">promotions? In the county we live in, you actually have the ability to negotiate or appeal the valuation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of your home for property tax purposes. And we were actually able to lower our home's valuation on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">record by about 25%, which in turn lowered our property tax by 25%. So that's definitely something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that I encourage everyone to do. Just if there's a major expense in your life, or if there's something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">just ask yourself, is it possible that this is flexible? I don't negotiate at the grocery</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">store, but anytime I see that it might be a possibility, I'm absolutely doing that. So for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">example, one thing that we probably all spend a lot of money on is Amazon. I'm not necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">negotiating prices on Amazon, but what I am doing, and this is my next tip, is I install the Keepa</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">extension, and there's probably a dozen extensions that do this. I like this one, but I don't have any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">affiliation with them. And they just show you a trending price graph of all the different prices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This has been over the last, I want to say 90 or even 365 days. So you can see, I'm not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">negotiate with Amazon, but if I see that this thing I'm buying is always $30 and today it's 35 and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">goes on sale nine out of 10 days, well, I'm going to wait a day or a week and see when the price comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">down and buy it then. And whenever I'm buying anything, my next favorite tip here is to always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">stack deals. So you might not negotiate to get the price lower, but there's a series of things that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">would encourage you all to look at anytime you're making a major purchase. So I don't think that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">going out and doing this for a $5, $10, $20 purchase. But if we're buying, you know, a new dresser, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">we're buying a new appliance, I'm absolutely going to see how many things I can stack to get a better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">price. And so those things could be coupons, whether you find them or whether you find a website, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if it's still alive, but there was this website, savendeals.com. If it's alive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll put a link in the show notes. And they were selling Home Depot and Lowe's coupons for a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars. So one, you can put a coupon in, you can also go through a shopping portal to earn points or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">cash back. You can look at your credit cards, whether it's Amex, Chase, Citi, Bank of America,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there are a lot of different card linked offers, like spend $49 at Chewy and get $15 back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">which is one we just used. And gift cards is another one. So you can buy gift cards at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">discount. And then finally, whatever you're putting the payment on, if it's your own credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">card, you can earn credit card points. So it's possible. And one of the best examples of doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">this was we bought this Japanese Toto toilet seat, built-in bidet, seat warmer, everything. It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">awesome. And we bought a coupon online. We went through a shopping portal and got one or 2%. There</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">was a card linked offer for Lowe's. We bought Lowe's gift cards on sale. And then we put the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">remainder balance because usually you buy gift cards in like $100, $250 denominations. And we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">put the remainder on a credit card that had purchase protection and earned cash back or points. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">actually remember which credit card it was this time. So we stacked all of that. We saved like 35%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">on the purchase. Another site I really like is SaveWise, which will kind of let you set up alerts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for when some of these shopping portal deals come up. So you could say, hey, if Lowe's is ever more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">than 5% off, let me know.

But for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">general purchases, even if it's just $5, there's no reason not to have one shopping portal extension and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">just load it.

In episode 212,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we went really, really deep on gift cards. And I tried to do some math. I think the average person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">could save thousands of dollars a year, at least with the gift card deals that were happening when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that episode was recorded. Right now, we're in a little bit of a lull for gift cards. But I think as we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">get towards the end of the year around the holidays, we'll probably get into another gift card boom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you think about the fact that gift cards go on sale all the time with all kinds of promotions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and there is a whole market of people buying those gift cards and reselling them at a loss because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">got a good deal on them. Well, if you're ever looking to buy something, you could pay for it with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a gift card that you bought on sale. And there are websites that make this easy to go buy those gift cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">like rays and flus. We built our own gift card site that about every two to three months, I launch for a few days</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">in the newsletter, all the hacks.com slash email, and we announced that gift card sites going live. But even if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">they're not on sale, you might earn a lot more points on your spending at office supply stores or grocery stores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it might make sense to pick up a gift card at the grocery store, earn the bonus points so that you can use that gift card to buy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">something somewhere else. One more thing to keep in mind for purchases that might have issues where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2347" target="_blank">00:39:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">really want to take advantage of your extended warranty or your purchase protection, which are common credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">card benefits that you get. Those are ones where I try to avoid buying them with gift cards. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">if I'm buying a computer or a cell phone where I want to be able to get an extra one or two year warranty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">because I put it on a credit card that offers that benefit, I'm not going to make that purchase with gift cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I'm buying groceries from Amazon Fresh, absolutely don't need the purchase protection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">or return protection. And I'm happy to use gift cards to buy those groceries. All right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple quick last ones before I talk about income and investment.

But applying the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">hell yes filter to anything in life has been such a powerful way for me and Amy to decide how we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">spend our time. Oh, we got invited to this thing. Is it a hell yeah? Because if it's not, let's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">pass.

It's excellent. I'll put a link in the show notes. Now, one thing that I think many of us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3598" target="_blank">00:59:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">forget that we can apply that filter to is our email. And so I was having a conversation with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3603" target="_blank">01:00:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">friend of mine the other day who was like, oh, this guy emailed me and I'm trying to figure out how do I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">reply? And I was like, do you have to reply? And he's like, well, he emailed me. And I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">just because someone sends you an email doesn't mean you owe them a response. Now, you might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">people with whom you have a relationship or your boss where yes, you do owe them a response. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes feel like when someone invites us to dinner, we have the ability to say no. But when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3628" target="_blank">01:00:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">someone sends us an email, even if we don't know that person, we sometimes and I catch myself doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this feel like we are obliged to reply. And I encouraged him to realize that he is in charge of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">his own inbox. He doesn't have to reply to every single email. And in this particular case, this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">one where he didn't need to reply and he just archived it. So I would encourage you to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3647" target="_blank">01:00:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">about, do I really feel like I have to give a response to every single person? We've all sent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3654" target="_blank">01:00:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">emails and not gotten replies back. Usually those are to people who maybe are better at managing their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3659" target="_blank">01:00:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">time than we are. Maybe not. But don't forget, you don't owe a reply to every email you get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, on the notion of time, you can outsource things you don't enjoy to buy back your time. So in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">episode 98, I sat down with Dan Martell, we talked about buying back your time. And he is excellent at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3679" target="_blank">01:01:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">finding things that are not a good use of his time, because he has a lot of business opportunities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3684" target="_blank">01:01:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">or finding things he just doesn't enjoy, and outsourcing them. And so one experiment that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">tried, probably around the time of this episode, was we realized with two young kids and a lot going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">on with work, this is before the podcast was our full time thing. And my wife and I had two full time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">jobs and a podcast and young kids. We thought, what is something that we just feel like we never have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">time for and we didn't enjoy in the moment. And at that time, it was having to stop work early to prep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3711" target="_blank">01:01:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">dinner for the family. And we cared about eating good food. So we didn't just want to do carry out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">every single night, we wanted whole foods that we could make. So I put an ad on Craigslist and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm looking for someone to prepare meals a few times a week.

I was looking for someone who enjoyed cooking could be someone who's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3733" target="_blank">01:02:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">retired could be someone who doesn't work anymore.

And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">person would drop them off two meals at a time. So on I think Monday, they drop off two dinners at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">quantity that there was enough leftovers that we would also have some food for lunch the next day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we had really healthy food that we could control what it was and what was going into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3766" target="_blank">01:02:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't have to take the time to cook it.

And we had the time to do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and it wasn't stressful.

And so you can find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">windows of your time where outsourcing things make sense. If you don't love cleaning the house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3784" target="_blank">01:03:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is that something you can outsource?

And in episode 190, I was talking with Sahil Bloom, and he talked about these three levels of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">listening.

And that was unintentional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3844" target="_blank">01:04:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was an episode with Nate and Kaylee Klempp, who together wrote this book about what they called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the 80 80 marriage.

But the idea is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of keeping track of everything, you know, we have this 50 50 marriage where I'll do the bedtime,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you do the bedtime, I'll do the bedtime, you do the bedtime, or I did bedtime last night.

If you can evolve to a place where everyone's trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to do 80% they won't always get there never going to happen perfectly.

So anytime you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">meet someone, you say, Oh, I've got this cocktail party next month, do you want to come on over?

And when I say cocktail parties, it doesn't have to be something fancy. I think that's the term he came up with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3943" target="_blank">01:05:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But it could be just a, you know, a happy hour.

So those three tips I love for relationships. Now health is so particular and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3986" target="_blank">01:06:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">specific that I decided not to go deep down the health path on this episode. But there are two tips that I want to share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that I picked up that are very simple and have been really impactful for me. So one is before I go out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4002" target="_blank">01:06:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">dinner, if I'm trying to be healthy, I'll look at the menu for the restaurant. And I will pre order in my head what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4009" target="_blank">01:06:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">going to order. And I find that maybe right after lunch, when I'm not that hungry, it's way easier to commit to, I'm going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4016" target="_blank">01:06:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this salad tonight, it looks great.

Now do I always make the decision I pre ordered? Not always, but it definitely helps to kind of have that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">commitment ahead of time. And I make healthier decisions. The next simple tip to make healthier decisions, you can see that I might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4035" target="_blank">01:07:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">have a challenge personally making healthy decisions, both at a restaurant and at home is I give myself permission to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4042" target="_blank">01:07:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the unhealthy thing. But I make myself do it in five minutes. And so my wife, Amy loves to bake. Sometimes there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4049" target="_blank">01:07:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">banana bread, sometimes there's cookies and all kinds of stuff. And I don't have a lot of self control. And so instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4056" target="_blank">01:07:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">saying no, which just doesn't work for me that well, I say yes, in five minutes, I find that if there's three dozen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4061" target="_blank">01:07:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">cookies sitting on the counter, and I say, Hey, I can have one of these, I just have to wait five minutes. In that five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4067" target="_blank">01:07:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">minute period, I've moved on, I've gone to do something, and I've completely forgotten about the cookie. Now, maybe I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">come back, maybe I repeat the thing, maybe I reward myself with a cookie. But it's such a benefit to me, and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4078" target="_blank">01:07:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">prevented me from binge eating a lot of cookies, which is something that I often have found myself doing in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4085" target="_blank">01:08:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">past. Okay, I think we got four more in two little categories, one on security and one on decision making. And so when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4091" target="_blank">01:08:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">comes to security, I've got two things, it's freeze and delete, and they both fall under the theme of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4095" target="_blank">01:08:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">locking down your financial information, your personal data. So first one is freeze everything. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4100" target="_blank">01:08:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">freeze your credit. There's this crazy report called the work number. If you go read up on it, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">find it. It's wild. It has all this information about every one of your pay stubs and your salary and your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4109" target="_blank">01:08:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus. You can freeze all of those things. So I would encourage you to go freeze your credit, freeze your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">work number report, and anything else like that. And then second, I'd encourage you to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your personal data is not on the internet. Now I like to do this not just for me, but for my family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4123" target="_blank">01:08:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second is to delete all of your personal data. And I think this is important because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">especially in a world we are in right now with AI tools, and AI agents, and the ability to listen to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4133" target="_blank">01:08:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">someone's voice and clone it, I want to make myself as little of a target as possible. And if you just go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">online and search for your name, and maybe the city you live in, you'd be surprised that there's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple websites with your address, your phone number, your personal information on there.

After I use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">delete me, I decided to partner with them on the show, you might have heard an ad for them earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">They're a tool that I actually pay for for my family.

It's been great to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4190" target="_blank">01:09:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">able to search my name and not find my address on the internet.

And one of the most exciting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4224" target="_blank">01:10:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">conversations I had in the past handful of years was episode 105 with a guy named Matt Higgins, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKvfT9AiUI&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">wrote a book called Burn the Boats.
