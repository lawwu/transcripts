that's going to go ahead and ask Amazon for the ID of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.920</a></span>

only does it print it, but it's going to save it into a variable called instanceID</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of my other scripts will use $instanceID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I now want to start that instance, so I just type AWS start and that's going to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">ahead and do this equivalent thing of going to the GUI, right-clicking, choosing start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The other nice thing it does is it waits until the instance is running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end it asks the queries for the IP address and prints it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this script that I have given you guys to set up these instances uses something called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">an elastic IP that actually keeps the same IP address every time you run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you should find that IP address stays the same, which makes it easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is the IP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I then have something called AWS SSH and AWS SSH will go ahead and SSH into that instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So all it does is basically use the username ubuntu, because that's the default username</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for this kind of image on AWS, and then $instanceIP, so that's that IP address we just got.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing it does is to use the private key that was created when this was originally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">set up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now in my case, I've actually moved that private key to be my default key, so I don't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">need that minus IP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just type ssh ubuntu at $instanceip, but you can just type aws-ssh, and you'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bang, here we are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are now inside that AWS image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the handy things about AWS is they have these things called AMIs, Amazon Machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Images, and an AMI is basically a snapshot of a computer at a particular point in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can start your own instance using a copy of that snapshot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the script I've given you guys, I've created and provided an AMI which has all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the stuff we want installed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why it is that when you use that script and log into it, you can start running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">things straight away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1571" target="_blank">00:26:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's do that right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I've created a directory already for you called nvs for notebooks.</span></div><div

Amazon to set up a jupyter notebook server for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And when it's done, it says okay, the jupyter notebook is running at all IP addresses on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is our IP address?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it told us up here when we started it, it's 52 blah blah

instance and I'll go 52, 40, 116, 116, in my case, colon, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it told me that the port is 8-8-8-8, so colon 8-8-8-8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm just typing in that here, press enter, and I put too many colons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's

target="_blank">00:27:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems to be computing things correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the basic idea here is that over there on Amazon, you have your server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It is running a program called Jupyter Notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Jupyter Notebook is causing a particular port which is 8-8-8-8 to be opened on that server,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where if you access it, it then gives you access to this Jupyter Notebook environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">In your team, you guys can all use the same Jupyter Notebook if you want to, or you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">run multiple Jupyter Notebooks on one machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really pretty flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So now that I've created one, I could rename this, say, this is Jeremy's Notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then Rachel might come along and be like, oh, I want to run something as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So she goes new and her computer, and it creates a whole new one over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And she could save file, rename, Rachel's Notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I now go back here, you can see both of these notebooks are shown to be running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the server is running multiple kernels, they're called.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see back here, it's saying "creating new notebook, kernel started".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So each of those are totally separate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So from one of them, I say "name = Rachel", and in the other one, I say "name = Jeremy",</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=1778"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one of the ones I like is Ctrl+B double quote, which creates a second window

<span class="t">And so I tend to set up a little Tmux session and get it all set up the way I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_ckFbc6bI&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not going to go into detail about how to do everything I show
