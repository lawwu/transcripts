So you ask chat GPT a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">question and it goes to find, it runs a search and then it scours through the list of 20 links</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and it doesn't stop until it finds a good answer.

They also have a thing called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a retrieval API, which allows developers to share proprietary knowledge bases with chat GPT. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a company knowledge base or some other kind of content, you can share with chat GPT so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that chat GPT can be aware of that.

So, you know, an image is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">matrix of, you know, data that's rendered on a screen and as pixels and those pixels are different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4145" target="_blank">01:09:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">colors.

But a lot of digital artists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4219" target="_blank">01:10:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">said, this is automating my work.

And if that's all they did, then I think the bill would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4829" target="_blank">01:20:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">supported by most Americans.

That's not the intent.
