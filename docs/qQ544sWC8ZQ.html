Well, one of the plugins that OpenAI has introduced itself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1684">00:28:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is called the browsing plugin.

So you ask chat GPT a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1698">00:28:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">question and it goes to find, it runs a search and then it scours through the list of 20 links</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1704">00:28:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and it doesn't stop until it finds a good answer. And then it comes back to you with just the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1707">00:28:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">answer.

That's mind blowing. They also have a thing called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1716">00:28:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a retrieval API, which allows developers to share proprietary knowledge bases with chat GPT. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1723">00:28:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a company knowledge base or some other kind of content, you can share with chat GPT so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1728">00:28:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that chat GPT can be aware of that. And there are some privacy concerns, but the company has said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1733">00:28:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to sandbox that data and protect it. As an example, I'm planning on writing a book on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1739">00:28:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">SAS using chat GPT, and I'm going to put together all the previous articles and talks I've done as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1744">00:29:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a database so I can then work with that in chat GPT. So you're going to have more and more developers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1749">00:29:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">sharing information with chat GPT.

And I think that as those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1762">00:29:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds of millions of users use the product, and as developers keep sharing more and more of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1766">00:29:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">these data sets, the AI is going to get smarter and smarter. And then what's going to happen is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1771">00:29:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">both consumers and developers are going to want to use or build on the smartest API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1776">00:29:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, see, this is where it feeds on itself. I mean, yeah, I think there might be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1780">00:29:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I agree with much of what you're saying. But I do think somebody like Facebook, when they release</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1785">00:29:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">their language model, which they're about to, is not going to allow chat GPT to have any access to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1790">00:29:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the Facebook corpus of data. And then LinkedIn will do the same, they'll block any access to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1795">00:29:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">chat GPT to their data. And so then you might say, you know what, I'm doing something related</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1800">00:30:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to business and business contacts, I need to use the LinkedIn one.

I'll also highlight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3954">01:05:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, back in the day, one human had to farm a farm by hand. And we eventually got the tool of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3959">01:05:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a hoe and we can put in the ground and make, you know, make stuff faster.

And it's completely changed the game. So the unit of output per farmer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3981">01:06:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is now literally millions of times what it was just 150 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3985">01:06:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that case, Freeberg, nobody wants to do backbreaking labor in the fields.

So like when Adobe Photoshop and digital photography</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4155">01:09:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">arose, photographers were like, this is, you know, BS, why are you digitizing photography</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4160">01:09:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">was analog and beautiful before. And then what digital photography allowed is the photographer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4165">01:09:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to do editing and to do work that was creative beyond what was possible with just a natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4170">01:09:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">photograph taken through a camera.

And then in the early 90s, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4178">01:09:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">was a plugin suite called Kai's power tools that came out in Adobe Photoshop. And it was a third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4184">01:09:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">party plugin set, you would you would buy it and then it would work on Photoshop and it did things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4189">01:09:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like motion blur, sharpening, pixelation, all these interesting kind of like features.

And the Kai's power tools created this instant toolkit where in a few seconds, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4214">01:10:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">created a blur on the image. And that was an incredible toolkit. But a lot of digital artists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4219">01:10:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">said, this is automating my work.

And the same happened in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4224">01:10:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">animation when three when you know, CGI came around, and animators were no longer animating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4228">01:10:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">cells by hand.

I think that they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4432">01:13:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to try and accelerate their product roadmaps.

And we're just gonna have to find out what that long term really looks like. And maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4451">01:14:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">will look very different. I mean, once we get past the short term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4456">01:14:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we may have a different long term view.
