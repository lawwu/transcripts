So you disobey mommy, mommy's going to call you to account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You disobey daddy, daddy's going to call you to account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you disobey mommy or daddy when daddy's around, daddy's going to call you to account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if we're in the living room and the little child is there playing on the floor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and Noel says, it's time to get ready for bed now. Run along, get your pajamas on and come down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we'll have devotions. And daddy's sitting there, she's sitting there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and this little child clearly heard the message and did not move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. At that point, dad steps up to the plate and says, your mother said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're supposed to go get your pajamas on. Did you hear that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you make the call as to whether something needs to be done more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But dad's not passive at this point. So that's the principle that we have worked on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that the qualification, before I give you the biblical foundation for it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the qualification Noel gave me last night, she said, you know, there are situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you remember when we talked it over with our kid who were giving me a hard time at the store,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">taking advantage of me at the store, not obeying me because they know in public</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that they can't have the same consequence as at home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talked with them together and we said, look, if you do this again, I say, daddy says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you do this again, if mommy tells me that you're giving her a hard time, you're going to reckon with me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't think it's good to put make dad the bogeyman all the time saying daddy's going to deal with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Daddy's going to deal with this. But there are times when some special instances means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that dad is the one who mommy points to when things have gotten out of hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So why do we have that that principle that both discipline when they are alone and dad disciplines when they're together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason it's good to discipline that mom has the right to discipline is because the Bible says she does in Deuteronomy 21, 18,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">though they discipline him referring to mom and dad. But the big issue probably for most dads is why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do I say, come on, dad, step up to the plate, become the point man when mom and dad are together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here are the reasons. The Bible pictures the husband as the head, the leader, the normal initiative taker,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which would include the vision, the vision caster for the moral life of the family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So together with his wife, he's thinking through and developing a vision for the moral and spiritual life of the family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's leading the family in living this out by example and by explanation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's taking the initiatives to see that that happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that means that the most natural person for taking the initiative in discipline is the leader of the family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He leads. He goes ahead. He steps up. He's not passive. He's not waiting to see if mom acts. He moves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The child learns the valuable lesson that men are not passive. They're not waiting around for mom to deal with things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They take initiative for the good of the family. They follow through with what they taught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The family believes in the family does. There's no thought here that mama is a pushover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't mean to imply that she's not a pushover. He knows that these kids know that good and well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're there with her most of the time and she's no pushover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But they want I want them to learn. We wanted them to learn that they don't tangle not only with either of us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that they don't tangle with with mom while dad's present, especially because a special respect is being shown there to mom by dad, by his stepping in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's reason number one. He's the head leader initiative taker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Reason number two is that that the husband bears this special responsibility because the Bible presents him as protector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ephesians five shows that Christ is is rescuing his bride. He's saving his bride from destruction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what husbands are to do, like Christ. And by implication, they're rescuing the children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what discipline is. Discipline is mainly protection, protection from a kid's own selfishness, protection from a future tragedies and lawlessness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to get the kid in trouble if he lives a life of insubordination and and selfishness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the father bears a special responsibility for protecting the kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what it means to be a man. I protect my family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he protects them from the future miseries of disobedience to mom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Third, the husband bears this responsibility, especially to step in because the Bible presents him as a supporter and nurturer of mom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

households anyway, has been with these kids hours on end carrying the burden of discipline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when dad is around, he should pick it up, you know, lift that burden from mom and give her some relief so that she doesn't have to follow through with everything she tells these kids to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.000</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This means that a father's role is centrally important in giving a child a sense of what good fatherhood is like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_F9wcD9y0c&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that includes fatherly discipline, because Hebrews 12 says the Lord disciplines those whom he loves and chastises every son whom he receives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
