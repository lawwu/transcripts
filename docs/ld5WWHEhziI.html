But first we should take a moment to understand why overload in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">first place is so hard to avoid.

I want to do a brief bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of theory here. I'm going to, for those who are watching instead of listening, I'm going to draw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this beautifully on the screen. This is a chart, right? Because I'm a scientist here. So I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to draw a chart here. We have a y-axis and an x-axis. I'm actually going to label this chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's label the y-axis, the vertical axis here. I'm going to put, let's see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">obligations. That's pretty small. And then I'm going to put on the x-axis time. All right. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what am I going to do with this chart? Well, what most people have, whether they know about it or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">not, is a limit. And I'm drawing this as a dashed line going across the chart here. They have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">limit for how much obligations they can be dealing with at the same time without feeling overloaded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll even label that here. We'll call this Max Obligations. This is crude, but gives us the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">general idea. We have a maximum of obligations we can handle before we begin to naturally feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of overloaded. The actual position of this line on the y-axis, so the number of obligations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can handle before feeling overloaded, this has to do in part with what type of work we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about. It also has in part to do with your particular personality. Some people like me are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">very attuned to overload. It really stresses us out. Other people feed off of it a little bit more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but that line exists for most people. Now, here's the problem. We have a broken mental model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for how overload actually operates. Most people think here's what you do. You select a workload</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and you want it to be close to but below the max obligations. So maybe I'm putting a red line here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">across. You say, yeah, I'll just make my workload here. Keep it steady over time right below that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">max obligations dotted line threshold. So I'll be getting a lot done without feeling overloaded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why this doesn't work is that in reality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">your obligation count is like a giant super tanker on the ocean, right? When you get it moving in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">given direction, you can't just stop it on time. You can't just stop where you are and make a quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">turn. If you want to start turning, you're going to slide for a long time in one direction until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you can finally turn the directions. If you want to stop because you don't want to hit an iceberg</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in front of you, it could take you, and I've seen these numbers before, miles before that big mass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">comes to a complete stop. So you get moved in a direction that takes a lot of time, even after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to change it for you to move back in the other direction. As a result, when you try to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">your obligations around a certain level, what you're going to get is oscillations above and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">below. So I'm going to draw this. I'll draw this here. I'm going to select another color. I'll use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">black. All right, so I'm going to draw this here. I guess I'll use orange. It becomes something more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like this. So if you're watching this instead of just listening, you'll see I have an oscillating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of sine curve that is going above where you're trying to keep it, then it falls below.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's really happening here is that when you realize you have too many obligations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you start to try to pull back, but it takes a while, and more stuff comes in, and you get much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">higher than you want to be. And then finally you go too far in the other direction, you fall lower</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">than you need to be. So you start bringing stuff on, and you go higher than you want to be. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">if we look at this here, we see there are these points above our max obligation line, periods of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">overload. This is difficult to deal with. Now one thing you could do is say, okay, I'll recognize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this reality, and I will build my wave. I'll start it lower. I'll have my target lower so that my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">peaks stay below my max obligation line. So I drew another curve here that's trying to indicate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do that, but here's the problem. In order to keep your peaks below your max</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">obligation line, look at these valleys now. These are really low. So if you're trying to make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that you never have too much to do, you're going to have, at a frequent point, way too little to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This might be so little to do that it's very notable. Your boss is like, "What's going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">here?" Your clients aren't getting service. You're not making enough money. The stuff in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">household that just has to get done, not all of it is getting done. So in order to average ourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">around a reasonable area, it feels like overload can be somewhat inevitable. So I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going on from a theoretical perspective. That's why it's difficult to avoid overload while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">still feeling like you're being reasonably productive. So what do we do about it? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I have three steps to recommend. These feed off each other. One after another, you do them in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this order. Step number one, reduce what you can right away. So you have that moment of, "Oh my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">God, I have too much on my plate. I'm stressed out." Typically, this comes after you're confronting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">some reality of your calendar. You're like, "My God, how am I going to get this all done? I feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so busy." To get some relief right away, say, "What can I take off my plate?" And it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have to be related to the final thing that pushed you over the edge.

Well, here's a few ideas. One, quotas. Certain type of work that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">need to do as part of your position, but that you have an unlimited supply of this work coming in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So at some point, you're going to have to say, no, you decide in advance what your limit is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is very common with college professors with, for example, peer review.

At a certain level, you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5WWHEhziI&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have more requests to do peer review than you have time to do.
