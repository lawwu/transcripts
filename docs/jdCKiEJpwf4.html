<span class="t">I think one of the darkest and most disturbing chapters of modern American history is everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that happened around conducting the so-called wars on terror.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If I can, allow me to list some of the estimates from the Cost of War project from Brown University,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">just so we understand the cost of these wars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The post-9-11 wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and Yemen led to an estimated 900,000 to 940,000 direct deaths</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and 3.6 to 3.8 million indirect deaths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the cost, in terms of dollars, was $8 trillion, with $2.2 trillion on Afghanistan and $2.9 trillion on Iraq and Syria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And the result on every front, as we'll talk about, I think it's fair to say, that it did not accomplish this purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, if we even just look at the human toll of the people of Afghanistan, I was also looking at the numbers before the war and after the war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">percent of Afghans facing food insecurity went from 62% to 92%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Percent of children under five experiencing acute malnutrition went from 9% to 50%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Percent of Afghans living in poverty went from 80% to 97%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was extremely costly for Americans, and it was extremely costly for Afghans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">As you do in your book enough already, can you lay out how the full history, the full context of how it is that the American people were misled into this war on terror</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that was so costly in so many ways?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's great to be with you on the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">One important statistic that you could have mentioned from the cost of war project as well is 37 million people displaced from their homes, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same group, it was, Lex, I'm telling you, it was at least five years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">God, it's the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this may have been seven, eight years ago that they did a study that determined that 30,000 American servicemen had blown their own brains out since then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, one way or the other, deliberately crashing their motorcycle or whatever it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, talk about the cost of war, that's far beyond, you know, the actual deaths in the war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We had about 4,500 in Iraq and about 2,500 in Afghanistan of just official airmen, marines, and soldiers on the ground killed, plus contractors and all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's speaking not just to the things that could be measured, but you can just imagine the scale of suffering that's going on in the veterans' minds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know what, too?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you would have guessed this probably, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably know more about this subject than me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a New York Times headline, I think, yesterday was, oh my God, look at, or maybe it was the Wall Street Journal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at this insane list of the kinds of drugs that all these depressed soldiers get put on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's 15 different psychoactive drugs, all to temper the side effects of the others and whatever, where, you know, and then they say that this could lead to suicide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, of course, we know that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They even have to say that on TV sometimes that some of these drugs cause suicidal or homicidal obsessions and this kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that's one of the side effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So some percentage of these guys might have made it if the government healthcare system hadn't helped them in the end is another bitter irony.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the whole thing is just, you know, you said we got nothing out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I said half in jest, but it is serious, but it's also, it shows by relief what a disaster this is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That the only thing we did get out of it, like literally, was advancements in prosthetic limbs for amputees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether they lost their limb in war or otherwise, if you want to boil it down, what did anyone get out of this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.580</a></span> | <span

partially in their defense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, and also at this time, oil is trading at $12 a barrel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So he has no ability to repay them, rebuild his country, or do any kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're completely putting the screws to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And on top of that, this is disputed whether they were literally the Kuwaitis literally slant drilling under the border or whether it's really, that's kind of shorthand, I think, usually for they were overproducing from shared oil wells that straddled the border.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you have a contract that where your property and my property put up next to each other and we got mineral rights, but we have a shared oil well down there, then we have a quota, how much we pump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're not allowed to cheat and pump more out of our shared well than me in any given month or whatever, as per the contract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's kind of how that thing works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, it's the same thing over an international border.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Kuwaitis, at least they're also accused, and I know less about this, but they're accused also of using slant drilling techniques that they've been taught by Americans to drill that way and steal Iraqi oil, you know, from the margin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So Hussein's pissed about this at the same time they're putting the screws to him over calling in their war debts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.460</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:50:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what happened was it was a matter of, you know, the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.</span></div><div

class="t">And so the CIA and CENTCOM were encouraging, which had been created as part of the Carter Doctrine, were encouraging Kuwait to be intransigent against Saddam and tell him to go to hell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, at the State Department, James A. Baker, through Ambassador Glaspy and through Margaret Tutwiler and John Kelly, were sending signals that actually go ahead, we don't really care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just celebrated April Glaspy Day the other day, we do every year, July 25th, where she told Saddam Hussein, listen, it's the same thing as when I was the ambassador to Kuwait.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The Iraq issue and your border dispute is not associated with America, and we have no position on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to

had the Iraqi version of that story published in The New York Times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=3055" target="_blank">00:50:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But then we got from Manning and Assange, we got the State Department's version of that document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's a little less explicit as far as how it makes the Americans look, but it's essentially the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.320</a></span> | <span

So he ends up bugging out and says, I think the FBI is onto me and bugs out. Then they brought in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=7727" target="_blank">02:08:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Ramsey Youssef, the guy who built the bomb, the real bomb, the real terrorist who came in.

And the whole thing really could have been over by Christmas. And by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9447" target="_blank">02:37:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Gary Burntzen said that he said that to the reporter, Michael Hirsch in 2016. He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9452" target="_blank">02:37:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's really sad when you think about it, how this thing could have all been over by Christmas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9456" target="_blank">02:37:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So that ain't just me.

Right. So when you read Gary Burntzen's book, he goes, and there I was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9480" target="_blank">02:38:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and me and my fellow CIA officers were talking about how frustrated we were that we could not understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9486" target="_blank">02:38:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">why they wouldn't give us the reinforcements while he's getting away. And then the next four sentences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9490" target="_blank">02:38:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are blacked out. It's like, you know, and then, and same thing for, for Dalton Fury, uh, Thomas Greer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9498" target="_blank">02:38:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do we get to Iraq? Let's do Iraq. Here's where we're going to start Iraq. First of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9502" target="_blank">02:38:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Wolfowitz and all them wanted to go all the way to Baghdad in 1991 and senior told them, no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9508" target="_blank">02:38:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and stop short of that. Also let Saddam crush the Iraqi, uh, up the Shiite and Kurdish uprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9515" target="_blank">02:38:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then of course we have the status quo of Bill Clinton's containment policy, dual containment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9519" target="_blank">02:38:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">policy from Iraq, from Saudi Arabia against Iraq and Iran through the 1990s, sanctions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9524" target="_blank">02:38:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">no fly zone bombings, and all of that. So in, and by the way, there are two failed CIA coups in 1995</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9531" target="_blank">02:38:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and 1996 against Saddam. Um, one of them was the one that got Robert Baer in so much trouble because he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9537" target="_blank">02:38:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was working with Ahmed Chalabi, the Iraqi exile to try to overthrow Saddam. And it all went to hell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9542" target="_blank">02:39:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because Chalabi was basically selling them. Uh, Chalabi was basically making a bunch of promises</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9549" target="_blank">02:39:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to them about how it would go. That of course did not work out at all. And so this is where the CIA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9554" target="_blank">02:39:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">first put their burn notice on him. So Ahmed Chalabi is this important Iraqi exile. He was a banker in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9560" target="_blank">02:39:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Jordan who then fled the country because he was wanted for embezzling money. And here he was selling the CIA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9568" target="_blank">02:39:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on all of his promises about what he could do in Iraq. And then he was not coming through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9573" target="_blank">02:39:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's sort of a minor part of the story. But then in 1996, David Wormser, who's an important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9581" target="_blank">02:39:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">neoconservative, uh, in alliance with the more important neoconservative Richard Pearl and also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCKiEJpwf4&t=9588" target="_blank">02:39:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Douglas Fythe, their fellow traveler.
