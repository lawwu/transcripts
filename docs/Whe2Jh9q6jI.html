href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for having me, Andrew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">For so many people, the idea of science and religion or science and God are opposite one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe even mutually antagonistic to one another, depending on who you're talking to and how it's framed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes sense, I think, to a lot of people, religious or not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">just because on the face of it, science is supposed to be about disproving hypotheses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And religion in most people's minds is based on belief and faith in things that are difficult to disprove.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Not impossible, perhaps, but difficult to disprove.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And people go back and forth trying to prove the existence of God, trying to disprove the existence of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This is going on for many, many thousands of years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">To start, I just want to know, what is your view on the compatibility of science?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's just say belief in God, because religion and belief in God are somewhat separable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll get into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But to keep things simple, what do we know for sure about the compatibility or lack of compatibility between what we call science and a belief in God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, the question of belief in God, and you're right, it gets in the way of this because people will say, well, if I believe in God, then I can't embrace science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But let me start at the beginning and say, well, I think the question of does God exist isn't a useful question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean it's not an important question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

But which nonetheless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">feels right and leads to positive outcomes. And for him, if those two criteria were true, then it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">rational to embrace that belief.

And so I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">again, you know, where we are is either of those philosophies can be valid.

Look at all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters in the world for gravity and other physical coefficients. If they weren't tuned just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly right, life could never evolve here. And the probability against them being tuned just exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right is low. And then people say, well, sure, but there can be hundreds of millions of other universes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right, that we do in the multiverse.

But to take that final step of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">belief or disbelief, it's faith one way or the other. And again, it's why I think scientists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">need to stay in their lane.

I sort of take the same view when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">comes to the notion that religious belief or strong, or even strong belief in God, praying, etc., could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">useful. To me, these aren't mutually exclusive.

So what was once considered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sorcery and pseudoscience often becomes the topic of a discrete study. Of course, with controlled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">conditions, you get better understanding of what those things can and can't do. But I think we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">arriving at the time where religion and science are going to start to be looked at with scientific rigor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's going to bring about more acceptance of God and religion in terms of how the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mind works and and well-being. I agree with you. But let's let's talk about that older generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because you're right. I have many in my family, too, who, you know, if the doctor doesn't prescribe it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">don't take it. But even during that time period, when those folks were younger, the pharmaceutical companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I make this argument in my book, the pharmaceutical companies had technology to make all kinds of drugs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but they didn't know where to look. And so what did they do? They sent people to traditional cultures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">around the world to find substances that say the traditional culture say can help people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They called it bioprospecting at the time. And, you know, sure, a lot of those didn't do anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but some did. And from those, we've got we've found wonderful chemotherapy drugs, drugs that reduce pain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">etc. And we wouldn't have done that if we didn't let go of our arrogance that some of this traditional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">wisdom might not be valid.

But if you talk to the monks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll say that's not why it was created, right? It's probably apocryphal.

And these were actors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that we hired, you know, the people coming into the study thought they were just other people waiting in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the room. And so there was one chair left. And so the person would take the last chair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">About two or three minutes later, a person would come down the hallway, also an actor who worked for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">who was on crutches, wearing one of those, you know, boots you put on your foot when it's when it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">broken. It wasn't really broken, looking like she was in a good amount of pain. She came into the room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all the three chairs were taken. At that point, she would kind of lean back against the wall,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">let out a little whimper of pain. And what we wanted to look at is would somebody help her? Now, the two actors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in the chairs, we told do what you do when you're on the subway, right? You don't want to give up your seat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">don't look at the person, thumb your phone, ignore them, right? So we're creating a situation where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people aren't helping. And our question was, would the person who was in the study in the third chair</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually help this person? In the control condition, people who weren't meditating, about 15% of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">got up and said, "Oh, do you want my chair? Can I help you? Can I hold something for you?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">In the meditation condition, it was close to 50% of people who did this, right? We tripled the rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">at which somebody felt compassion for somebody else in pain and was willing to help them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a pretty big effect in terms of behavioral science. So that was a small study, so we've replicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it. We've also done it in a situation where someone is provoking you. So in this situation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people who had been meditating or not came to the lab and there's a paradigm that's designed to evoke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">anger. And the way it works is you create a, you spend five minutes to write a story about your life's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">goals. You have to then present this to the other subject, who they didn't know was an actor for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">He listens to this and he says, "Really? That's your plan? That doesn't make any sense," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was a paradigm developed by an anger researcher named Tom Denson. And we know it creates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the HPA axis anger response, and so it's really well validated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And people either meditated, or in this case, the control was an active control. They had done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">lumosity brain training for a while. And what we found is that those who, they were then given the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">chance to cause punishment to this person. I don't, I won't go into it all, but they thought there was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">way for them to cause this person pain. The people who didn't meditate were willing to cause this guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a good amount of pain. Now, it didn't actually happen, of course, but they thought it would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Those who had meditated refused to cause him any pain. They still said what he did was wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and they'd want to talk to him and tell him what he did was wrong. But they thought that creating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">more pain and suffering was not the way to go about it. And so for us, you know, right here was evidence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that these practices make you kinder, make you more compassionate. The other way, what does it save</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you from in terms of stress? This isn't my work, but there's a lot of work on prayer. And so when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">people pray, especially if you're reciting formal prayers, not so much if you're just having a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation with God, but if you're saying the rosary or you're reciting, you know, Hindu sutras or any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">formulaic prayer, what it typically does is it reduces your respiration rate. Not only does it reduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">your respiration rate, but it also tends to increase the duration of the exhalations. And this is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">meditation as well. What does that do? I mean, you've talked about breathwork a lot on your show,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? What it does is it increases vagal tone, reduces heart rate. It puts the body in a state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">where it is not expecting threat or challenge in the environment, where it wants to engage and be more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">open to socialization. It reduces cortisol responses. And so what it's basically doing there is, yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you're saying the words, but it's reducing the stress in your body. And even if you're praying about things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that are bothering you, things that you're sad or anxious about by saying those prayers over and over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">again, stuff travels up the vagus, right? And so by increasing exhalations, by slowing the respiration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">rate, it's telling your mind you're safe, things are okay. And thereby it's reducing the stress. And so when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2042" target="_blank">00:34:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you look at that data from Tyler Vanderbilt that I mentioned on young adults who pray, why does it reduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">stress? It's basically a way of increasing vagal tone in that moment. And it helps you sit with the ideas of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2055" target="_blank">00:34:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are bothering you, while physiologically, your body's telling you you're safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you for reminding everyone that signals travel up the vagus in addition to the vagus nerve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2067" target="_blank">00:34:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">controlling slowing of the heart rate when you exhale, because I think we hear a lot about the vagus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pathway and most people get it wrong.

And that actually helps answer the question that was in the back of my mind heading into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this conversation, which was, well, I'll tell by way of anecdote how I arrived there. My high school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">girlfriend was Greek Orthodox, a lot of Greeks in our family. And it wasn't like that movie, My Big Fat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Greek Wedding, but it wasn't dissimilar either to go over there, you know, and Greek Easter and like people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">were breaking plates and all the festivities. But one thing I learned spending time with people in the Greek Orthodox</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">community is there's a lot of prayer in their family. There were also a lot of use of worry beads,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, these like beads that people would would use. It was not unlike spinners, right. But often while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">reciting prayer, this was more in the older generation in her family and friends. And there was also a lot of superstition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that comes up in that movie, but there was a lot of superstition. So I asked her, I was like, why,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">why all the superstition?

So it's about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's about replacing all of that with repeating themes, literally loops of thought that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, they could break out of and interact. I'm not suggesting all Greeks are like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way.

Again, they're somewhat generational. Worry beads and prayer and ritual,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, and all these things sort of blend together seamlessly.

A lot of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

So let me give you an example that kind of picks up on what you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">saying.

But some groups may have figured things out more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">another.

I don't know. But in Hindu ceremonies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they do it as well, in certain Hindu ceremonies.

So I think those two can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">be separated.

As I said before, it's a mind-body practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the moving in time, the motor synchrony, is putting your body in a state where it's more receptive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to messages about community or coming together, as opposed to feeling tense, where your body is saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, no, no, there's a threat here." But your mind is saying, "No, Dave, be good and reach out to these people."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in that sense, combining the creedal elements, the belief elements with the practice leads to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">greater effect than the practice on its own. You see the same thing with meditation, right? Meditation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we're all sitting at home with our apps, right, by ourselves. That's not the way meditation is supposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to be done. Traditionally, it was done in a sangha, in a community. And as you said before, why is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">important? Because as we're breathing together, our respirations are entraining upon one another. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's creating that sense of synchrony to build community. So I think adding the message elements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of what religions value to the mind-body practice puts you in a situation where you get a synergism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is what worries me when we try to extract certain elements. So psychedelics is one great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">example. Psychedelics traditionally, whether it was ayahuasca or psilocybin, were taken in the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of a ceremony where you had a shaman who, through chanting or drum beats or whatever it might be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">created a situation where the body was very relaxed and felt safe. And then at that point, you would take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the psychedelic. And we had Michael Pollan on my show. And then when he said, he told me, he said, Dave, the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that's really important when you take psilocybin is you have to feel supremely safe. Because when that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">moment of self-dissolution comes or ego death comes, it can be beautiful or it can be terrifying. And if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">don't feel safe, it can go the wrong way.

And so you have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shaman with you.

What it's basically doing is, is loosening the mind, right? It, it, it reopens up periods of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of critical learning.

So first, the question of why do I think religions think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about it as outside of us? So one of the things I teach is moral psychology. Why do people do good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or bad? And what the data has shown us over the past few decades is that people's moral behavior is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3876" target="_blank">01:04:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lot more variable than anyone would ever predict. And because of that, because most people like to think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3883" target="_blank">01:04:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ourselves as good people, when we do something wrong that's objectifiably wrong, we feel like something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3889" target="_blank">01:04:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">came over us, right? And so it's easy to say there's an evil force outside that was guiding me. What we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3896" target="_blank">01:04:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">learning now is that a lot of moral processing within the brain happens kind of below your conscious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3903" target="_blank">01:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">awareness. And I'll give you an example of that in a minute. So it feels like it's coming over us, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">therefore, maybe it's some other force. But the point you raise is a good one, right? We did not evolve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to be saints. We did not evolve to be sinners. We evolved to be adaptive, right? To basically be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">reproduce and pass on our genetic material.

And therefore, most of the time, when people can see what we're doing, we're going to try and be good, because we don't want a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reputation for being a bad person.

But if you're in a situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3940" target="_blank">01:05:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">where you can have your cake and eat it too, that's adaptive. You're going to take it. And so as an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=3946" target="_blank">01:05:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">example, we do studies on cheating in my lab.

Now there are situations where we tell them you can't decide you must do what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4046" target="_blank">01:07:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the coin tells you.

They will create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4063" target="_blank">01:07:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a story because no one likes to think of themselves as bad.

A lot of prayer, the most common prayer is a prayer of gratitude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">gratitude.

So the question I have is when people pray, when people have a belief in God, presumably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4332" target="_blank">01:12:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they feel less alone.

In fact, at some point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4341" target="_blank">01:12:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I found anyway, that if you pray regularly, that you never feel lonely, you never feel alone because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4348" target="_blank">01:12:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you realize that people come, people go.

We're talking about the evolution of the eye or of the body. Let me say, to me, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4915" target="_blank">01:21:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">scientific method was the greatest, one of the greatest discoveries ever.

I do not believe in intelligent design. But we're in one of those situations again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4925" target="_blank">01:22:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">where people can interpret it different ways. You know, there is every reason to believe the eye could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4932" target="_blank">01:22:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have evolved in the way it did. And there were probably lots of different mutations that didn't benefit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4936" target="_blank">01:22:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things. And then by probability, those all went away. And the ones that did kind of went forward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4941" target="_blank">01:22:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on and on. I think for some people, what it really is, is this sense of awe, right? When you see something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4949" target="_blank">01:22:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that is so spectacularly complex, like the eye, you're kind of awed by it. How did it evolve in just this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4956" target="_blank">01:22:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">way? And so that emotion itself, the experience of awe itself, actually makes people more open to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4965" target="_blank">01:22:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">supernatural experiences. So this is wonderful work done by a student of mine, now a professor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4970" target="_blank">01:22:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at St. Olaf, Carlo Valdezolo. And what he showed is that when you allow people to feel awe by showing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4978" target="_blank">01:22:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">them natural beauty, like pictures of the Grand Canyon or wonderful sunsets or however you go and you induce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4983" target="_blank">01:23:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it architecturally, people suddenly give more probability to the idea that there is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=4995" target="_blank">01:23:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond them, right? And so here again, you're seeing the combo. You're saying, "Well, this, how could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5000" target="_blank">01:23:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this ever form? I'm in awe of it. Oh, I'm feeling that emotion that makes me more open to the idea that there is in fact something beyond." And it seems to feel right. And let's face it, most people, if you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5001" target="_blank">01:23:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">trained scientifically, you don't really understand how to think probabilologically. And I'm not saying that's a problem with people, it's just part of our business, right? We have to learn how to think that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5019" target="_blank">01:23:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it just seems like so completely impossible that this one out of a trillion thing could happen. But if you think about how many other steps were taken, how many other different ways the lines could have gone in the genetics, they probably did. And they probably didn't work. And so they're left behind. It's kind of like the argument, I never wore a seatbelt and I'm alive. Well, you are. But a lot of the other people who didn't aren't, right? And so you can't prove it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5048" target="_blank">01:24:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can't prove it that way. So for me, I think, it kind of brings me back to this issue of why I just don't think it's a relevant scientific question. Because you can't prove it one way or the other. And so it's always going to come down to faith. And so even people who make intelligent design arguments, ultimately, I find them not persuasive. Because as you said, we can work our way to it. And then how do you prove there's two routes to get there? How do you prove which one it was? It's an article of faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5075" target="_blank">01:24:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Well, I personally believe in evolutionary theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5078" target="_blank">01:24:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, me too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5079" target="_blank">01:24:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also believe in God. And I don't think they're mutually exclusive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5082" target="_blank">01:24:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this is the other problem, right? People say, well, I know what God is and what God did. If there is a God and the way God created the universe and did things, none of us have any conception of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5097" target="_blank">01:24:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's probably beyond our brain's ability to understand what that is. And so for me, like you, I don't see any tension. The tension comes when you become very tied to actual texts, right? And positions of people interpreting what they think God did or what they think God said. And that's where you run into problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5119" target="_blank">01:25:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I feel like the word that keeps sneaking up in my mind is overwhelm. I mean, we could think of awe as a positive experience. It usually is. But in some sense, you have to wonder whether or not some of the where one inserts belief in God versus belief in a scientific process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5138" target="_blank">01:25:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, not mutually exclusive, but has to do with where they sort of draw the line of overwhelm or where the line of overwhelm arises for them. Because when I look at the Grand Canyon, I don't know much about geology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5148" target="_blank">01:25:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I have some sense of how it got there, but it is kind of overwhelming, right? I can't just zero in on one, you know, kind of layer of sedimentation and know the story of that, which makes perfect sense why there are, you know, millions of layers on top of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5162" target="_blank">01:26:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, you would get that, that wall within the Grand Canyon, whereas I can look at an eye, whether or not it's in a cuttlefish, which have very interesting eyes, by the way, W-shaped pupils, or a old world primate eye like ours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5177" target="_blank">01:26:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can say, yeah, you know, if you had a couple hours and you were having trouble falling asleep, I could tell you the story of how the photoreceptors wired up with the bipolar cells with the ganglion cells and how it tells your brain everything from time of day to the color and contour of images in the room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5191" target="_blank">01:26:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we understand that.

<span class="t">And so, those folks are the ones because they're struggling with the belief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5567" target="_blank">01:32:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like certainty, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5568"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5571" target="_blank">01:32:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And certainty that things are going to be good is better than certainty that there's just an end and there's no suffering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5576" target="_blank">01:32:56.920</a></span> | <span

who don't know, they're the ones who are the most anxious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5581" target="_blank">01:33:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, um, I think for, I think, I think the reason a lot of religions talk about this, well, there are multiple reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5588" target="_blank">01:33:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">One is because it's just inherently strange to think that you're a conscious being, and one day that consciousness is going to end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5595" target="_blank">01:33:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's scary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5596" target="_blank">01:33:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But it often gets tied into a way to shape people's behavior, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5603" target="_blank">01:33:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Religions use that fear as a way to guide people, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5607" target="_blank">01:33:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you better be a good person or your karma is going to be bad and your next life is going to be in a worse position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5614" target="_blank">01:33:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you're going to go to hell and have pain for some period of time or perhaps everlasting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5621" target="_blank">01:33:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it takes on this moral tone and that fear is very motivating, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5627" target="_blank">01:33:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We know from the psychological literature, if you want to get somebody to do something, fear is a great way to motivate them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5633" target="_blank">01:33:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem with that is, is if you're constantly afraid of it all the time, your body is in the state of anxiety and that's not healthy for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5642" target="_blank">01:34:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think a lot of faiths try to kind of reinterpret fear of death in a different way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5651" target="_blank">01:34:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Death isn't always bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5653" target="_blank">01:34:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So one thing you'll find in a lot of faiths is they ask you to contemplate your death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5658" target="_blank">01:34:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So in Buddhism, there are meditations that are focused on thinking about yourself dying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5663" target="_blank">01:34:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's even these intense forms of meditation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5665" target="_blank">01:34:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I forget the actual word in the original language, but they're basically called corpse meditations where people, the monks will meditate in front of a decaying corpse over days as a way to study that you can actually see and experience what will happen to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5682" target="_blank">01:34:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In Christianity, right, there's this sense of contemplate your death on Ash Wednesday, which is the start of the season before Easter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5692" target="_blank">01:34:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In many traditions, the priest will put ashes on your head or the minister put ashes on your head and say, from dust, you came to dust, you will, you will go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5699" target="_blank">01:34:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a reminder that you're going to die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5701" target="_blank">01:35:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In Judaism, it's interesting, even on their New Year's, which is Rosh Hashanah, that's a celebratory day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5707" target="_blank">01:35:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's this prayer they say in, in temple called the Unatana Tocaf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5712" target="_blank">01:35:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of that is who's not going to be here next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5714" target="_blank">01:35:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Look around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5715" target="_blank">01:35:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Some will die by floods, some by famine, some by illness, some by fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5720" target="_blank">01:35:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, it's a reminder that life is ephemeral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5723" target="_blank">01:35:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the trick with this is if you can think about your death and not in a morbid way, not in a way that you dwell on it, it's actually quite useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5732" target="_blank">01:35:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the one thing we know in psychological science is that as people age, their values change, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5738" target="_blank">01:35:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're young, you want the new iPhone.</span></div><div

you happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5749" target="_blank">01:35:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">As you begin to age and you can see the end on the horizon, people's values change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5755" target="_blank">01:35:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Suddenly they value time with loved ones, service to others, kind of things that build a legacy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5765" target="_blank">01:36:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Interestingly, if you look at the literature, those are the things that really bring happiness at any age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5770" target="_blank">01:36:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are the things that experiences of people you love, service to others make you happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5775" target="_blank">01:36:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as we age, we come to realize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5780" target="_blank">01:36:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Work by the psychologist Laura Carstensen at Stanford shows that if you have people contemplate their death when they're young, temporarily it reorients their values toward the things that truly bring up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5790" target="_blank">01:36:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Suddenly they'll start caring about that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5792" target="_blank">01:36:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea of contemplating death, that is a part of almost every religious tradition, if you do it for a short period of time and not in a morbid way, but daily actually points you toward the things in life that make you more happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5808" target="_blank">01:36:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you then become a person of faith, you also believe that the end is going to be good for you as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5815" target="_blank">01:36:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you don't have that anxiety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5817" target="_blank">01:36:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think religion and death is a complicated thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5820" target="_blank">01:37:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There is fear of death, but there's also a way to use the idea that life is ephemeral to help us find happiness sooner than we typically do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5830" target="_blank">01:37:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">On a related note, I think one of the most interesting things about the human brain, aside from its ability to change itself, plasticity, is how much control we have over our perception of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5845" target="_blank">01:37:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say perception of time, I mean our ability to contract or expand our window of perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5852" target="_blank">01:37:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So just like we can contract and expand our visual window, we can contract and expand our perception of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5859" target="_blank">01:37:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a conversation like this, it's a fairly compact, I'm thinking about just the now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5866" target="_blank">01:37:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If I were to take a walk this afternoon and I wanted to think about, you know, who walked on this beach before me and before them and who's going to come after?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5876" target="_blank">01:37:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I can start to see a bigger time bin, as we call it, time window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5882" target="_blank">01:38:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the significance of any one thing that's happening in the current moment becomes much smaller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5888" target="_blank">01:38:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think about this a lot and there's a wonderful book that's not available in audio form called The Secret Pulse of Time that gets into how this expansion and contraction works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5899" target="_blank">01:38:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I feel like thread through every religion and every religious practice is an attempt to reconcile the need to feel, quote unquote, present, to live in the now, to do good deeds now, to not do bad deeds, to be grateful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5920" target="_blank">01:38:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, all of that socially connected, but also to link us to something larger that is basically designed to humble us, that we're not as important as we think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5932" target="_blank">01:38:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">No one problem is as important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5935" target="_blank">01:38:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Even the biggest challenge in the world is this too shall pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5940" target="_blank">01:39:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe not in your lifetime because you're thinking about it until your last breath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5943" target="_blank">01:39:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's hope not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5944" target="_blank">01:39:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But no one else is going to be worried about it afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5947" target="_blank">01:39:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't quite know how to formulate this question, but what I'm asking is here, perhaps, again, it's the notion that if one thinks really about the fact that we're going to die, we're all going to die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5961" target="_blank">01:39:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There are people claiming they're not going to die, but they too are going to die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5966" target="_blank">01:39:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of overwhelm in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5968" target="_blank">01:39:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If you really go into that and you, you know, if you're attached to your present life and the present moment as the most important thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5976" target="_blank">01:39:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can access ideas and feelings around the fact that, you know, you're part of a continuum, you're connected to people in the past that had the same fears, that alone makes you feel a little less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5990" target="_blank">01:39:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems a little less futile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=5992" target="_blank">01:39:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question I have is, what do you see across religions that allows people to bring themselves some peace around the reality that they're going to die?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6000"

he first started going, he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6828" target="_blank">01:53:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"I never felt God as palpably, the presence of God as palpably as I could feel it there."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6835"

expectation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6844" target="_blank">01:54:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he runs this camp and there are a lot of people who used to be Christian, who are experiencing this and coming to the camp and refinding their faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6855" target="_blank">01:54:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because in that moment they're having those transcendent experiences that you normally don't get when you're just sitting in church sometimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6862" target="_blank">01:54:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's another group, I forget the, I think it's called Milk and Honey, I don't remember, but they have a thousand person Shabbat for Jews there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6869" target="_blank">01:54:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's this incredible experience people report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6873" target="_blank">01:54:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think for a lot of people, they're looking for those spiritual experiences and things like Burning Man are a way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6880" target="_blank">01:54:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they have, what do they call them, little burns or remote burns right throughout the year where they'll come together at different times and do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6887" target="_blank">01:54:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think what you're seeing is a desire of people to kind of fill that God-shaped hole in their heart, to feel that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6898" target="_blank">01:54:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And for a lot of them, kind of the staid religious rituals that we're kind of getting now aren't doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=6905" target="_blank">01:55:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I could see something evolving out of that, but who knows where we're going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7078" target="_blank">01:57:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7079" target="_blank">01:57:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it makes sense to me why not many would break through.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7086" target="_blank">01:58:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think that the existence of Christianity, Judaism, the Muslim faith, and Buddhism kind of tiles what the human brain needs in terms of options?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7097" target="_blank">01:58:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, and atheism and agnosticism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7100" target="_blank">01:58:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you take those, it sort of like tiles the various like anxiety states that the brain has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7106" target="_blank">01:58:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And you go, you know, we don't really need another one, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7109" target="_blank">01:58:29.920</a></span> | <span

class="t">Grief, birth, enough celebrations each year, enough kind of ideas and flexibility about the afterlife, enough, you know, moral structure internally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7121" target="_blank">01:58:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Not such a huge time commitment for this one.</span></div><div

very serious Buddhist, that's a lot of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7129" target="_blank">01:58:49.920</a></span> | <span

investment in ritual and meditating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7132" target="_blank">01:58:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, you can be a really like a darn good Christian by going to church on Sunday and praying each day and doing some Bible reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7140" target="_blank">01:59:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, you know, that's compatible with a bunch of other things.</span></div><div

in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7145" target="_blank">01:59:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You see what I'm getting at here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7146" target="_blank">01:59:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7152" target="_blank">01:59:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then someone's saying, no, God figured it out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7155" target="_blank">01:59:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That this is what we need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7156" target="_blank">01:59:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It fills in the gaps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7157" target="_blank">01:59:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems unlikely that we're going to get a bunch of other religions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7160" target="_blank">01:59:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7161" target="_blank">01:59:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I mean, let me talk about the issue of cult versus religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7164" target="_blank">01:59:24.920</a></span> | <span

class="t">Cults primarily have the idea of this charismatic leader, which is why you often kind of hear this notion it's a cult of personality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7173" target="_blank">01:59:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's usually somebody who thinks they're special.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7175" target="_blank">01:59:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to worship that leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7177" target="_blank">01:59:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And when somebody thinks they're that special, things often go wrong with where they're going to lead people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7183" target="_blank">01:59:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Regular religions, though, can have the same problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7187" target="_blank">01:59:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the thing I'd like to say is when you look at religious practices, a way to think about them is as spiritual technologies, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7196" target="_blank">01:59:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They're technologies, mind-body practices that can move hearts and minds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7200" target="_blank">02:00:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They can move them for good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7201" target="_blank">02:00:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They can move them for ill, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7203" target="_blank">02:00:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It depends upon the motives of the people who are using them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7206" target="_blank">02:00:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, people always say, Dave, religions are the source of all war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7209" target="_blank">02:00:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Most wars aren't fought about religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7212" target="_blank">02:00:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There are some that are like, hey, I disagree with your interpretation of the scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7215" target="_blank">02:00:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of them are about land and resources, but religion gets pulled in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7221" target="_blank">02:00:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we know is that when you are feeling threatened, so the Bible, as you said, is a book of many voices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7230" target="_blank">02:00:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There are beautiful passages in there about mercy and kindness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7234" target="_blank">02:00:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There are other passages in there about dashing the heads of your enemies' babies against rocks, right, to punish them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7242" target="_blank">02:00:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we know is that when people feel more threatened, their conception of God — or this is work by the psychologist Kirk Gray and Joshua Jackson — their conceptions of God become more aggressive and punitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7257" target="_blank">02:00:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They believe that God values vengeance more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7260" target="_blank">02:01:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you ask them to recall verses from the Bible, they're going to recall the ones that are about smashing the baby's heads as opposed to being kind and merciful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7268" target="_blank">02:01:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is why you can see things like Christian nationalism form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7273" target="_blank">02:01:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see if you go to some of these events, you'll see pictures of Jesus holding an AK-47, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7279" target="_blank">02:01:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because our mind to be adaptive as if we're not evolved to be saints or sinners, when we feel we're threatened, we want to fight against that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7287" target="_blank">02:01:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We will use religion to justify it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7289" target="_blank">02:01:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the point that I want to make sure all your listeners know is, I'm not saying religion is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7293" target="_blank">02:01:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a technology that can be used for evil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7296" target="_blank">02:01:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I mean, even Richard Dawkins will say the same thing about science, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7299" target="_blank">02:01:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to find a way to cure people of maladies?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7303" target="_blank">02:01:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Science is your friend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7305" target="_blank">02:01:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to find the best way to annihilate a bunch of people most efficiently?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7310" target="_blank">02:01:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Science is your friend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7312" target="_blank">02:01:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for me, the reason I spend this time talking about religion is I know it can be used for bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7318" target="_blank">02:01:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you look at the data on average in people's lives, yes, certain institutions have caused people to be abused, discriminated against, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7327" target="_blank">02:02:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we should combat those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7329" target="_blank">02:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But on average, whether it's a gift from God or a cultural adaptation, it helps us live better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7334" target="_blank">02:02:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">For the most part, I agree with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7336" target="_blank">02:02:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That is, there's a lot of convergence in the practices of the faith because in some ways, we're all the same body and brain and it helps us solve those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7344" target="_blank">02:02:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're all pretty large and have their followings and they're attached to the culture you're raised in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7353" target="_blank">02:02:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that times of flux, times of change, and I kind of sense we're getting in one of these now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7362" target="_blank">02:02:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't mean like end times, but I mean things with technology, things with norms, the way that we have been living, our economic practices are changing really rapidly right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7373" target="_blank">02:02:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And people are becoming at the same time more disillusioned with some of the traditional faiths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7377" target="_blank">02:02:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for me right now, this seems like a period where there could be a reorientation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7382" target="_blank">02:03:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And the ones that are going to happen, that are going to come, are the ones that speak to people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7386" target="_blank">02:03:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7387" target="_blank">02:03:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There have been churches, they haven't stuck yet, but I could see this happening, where they're built around an AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7393" target="_blank">02:03:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is AI will become so knowledgeable that it will almost basically be an omniscient super intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7401" target="_blank">02:03:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Omniscient because it can know everything about you through what you do online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7404" target="_blank">02:03:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And super intelligence because it can solve problems better than humans can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7407" target="_blank">02:03:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are people who are thinking about churches around AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7412" target="_blank">02:03:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Will it stick or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7413"

target="_blank">02:03:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But to the extent that they, a new faith can let people feel that presence of God, can solve some of their problems by helping them feel connected to each other, reduce anxiety, reduce stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7428" target="_blank">02:03:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It wouldn't surprise me if something else comes now in this kind of moment of flux we're in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7435" target="_blank">02:03:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you're aware of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

IQ has been verified by Guinness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7443" target="_blank">02:04:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I know because they posted the Guinness certificate to their account on X.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7448" target="_blank">02:04:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I follow this person out of interest, is a self-declared Christian, very much aligning their platform as the highest IQ in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7461" target="_blank">02:04:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And by a huge margin, I should say, with their understanding of the Bible and why Christianity is the best answer to, holds the best answers to everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7471" target="_blank">02:04:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I should say I don't align with everything they post.</span></div><div

very interesting to me that you have people who are using technology like social media as a way to platform traditional longstanding religions and merging that with kind of modern notions of intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7490" target="_blank">02:04:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. IQ tests aren't the only way that we gauge intelligence, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7494" target="_blank">02:04:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think most people place enough value on people who have high extreme IQ to interpret it a certain way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7505" target="_blank">02:05:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I wondered until I realized this is actually a person, at least to my knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7509" target="_blank">02:05:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I wondered like, is this an AI thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7511" target="_blank">02:05:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7512" target="_blank">02:05:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's in Korea, he speaks English and he'll talk about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7516" target="_blank">02:05:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You're seeing it similar in Silicon Valley right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7518" target="_blank">02:05:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I think Peter Thiel is embracing Christianity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7521" target="_blank">02:05:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Really? Yeah. I'm pretty sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7522" target="_blank">02:05:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, okay. Even Elon Musk, who's, I don't think he says he believes in God, but he says Christianity is a force for good in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7529" target="_blank">02:05:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And recall him saying there's, there's got to be something there in terms of energy in the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7534" target="_blank">02:05:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Then when that question was posed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7535" target="_blank">02:05:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And so I, I think you're seeing this among a lot of tech sophisticates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7540" target="_blank">02:05:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have the good answer to why, but it is your, your point is well taken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7545" target="_blank">02:05:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That is intelligence, how religious you are does not correlate with intelligence, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7551" target="_blank">02:05:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There are really brilliant people who embrace the idea that there is a God and there is a creator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7557" target="_blank">02:05:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are some that aren't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7559" target="_blank">02:05:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's because those people realize, like I was saying before, that if you're a person who is really rational and is really intelligent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7568" target="_blank">02:06:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">when you look at the data, there's nothing to refute it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7571" target="_blank">02:06:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, no one sees evidence of God in the world scientifically, but we also realize we can't rule it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7578" target="_blank">02:06:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they have whatever their own inner life is, if they feel they have that connection, why reject it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7586" target="_blank">02:06:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I, I, I think it's important to realize that it's not a marker of poor intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7593" target="_blank">02:06:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless there's something I'm not aware of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7596" target="_blank">02:06:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The person holding the Guinness confirmed highest IQ in the world is certainly highly religious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7601" target="_blank">02:06:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7602" target="_blank">02:06:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, uh, so we know the, uh, the boxes are checked at probably all, all up and down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7607" target="_blank">02:06:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They're probably atheists that have very low intelligence and atheists with very high intelligence and Christians and Jews and Muslims and the, and the Buddhists and the, and the whole business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7616" target="_blank">02:06:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the reasons why certain religions get tacked with, um, stereotypes, um, are the, the kind of avatars that we see in our mind when we think about that religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7629" target="_blank">02:07:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, um, Buddhism, you think about the Dalai Lama.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7634" target="_blank">02:07:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The Dalai Lama seems, um, like what most people think about the Dalai Lama.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7638" target="_blank">02:07:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, well, prior to this recent kind of controversy, I thought the Dalai Lama is just kind of like a, just a happy, just happy, all good with everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7647" target="_blank">02:07:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7648" target="_blank">02:07:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, even the, the, um, style of clothing is very kind of, um, generic across monks when the Dalai Lama's walking around, like, you know, all in these orange robes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7659" target="_blank">02:07:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I look pretty, pretty peaceful and happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7663" target="_blank">02:07:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, so people, I think assume that, okay, well, um, if you want to feel like that, Buddhism would be a good idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7672" target="_blank">02:07:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7673" target="_blank">02:07:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7674" target="_blank">02:07:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, whereas other religions tend to have a bit more of a outward, their brand is a bit more varied in terms of the emotional tone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7681" target="_blank">02:08:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7682" target="_blank">02:08:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">As you mentioned, we talked about Christianity, certainly Old Testament, New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7685" target="_blank">02:08:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7686" target="_blank">02:08:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think about the branding of religions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7688" target="_blank">02:08:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7689" target="_blank">02:08:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I feel like it's one of the most important factors that either draws people toward or away from a religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7694" target="_blank">02:08:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7695" target="_blank">02:08:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether or not the person is speaking words of love, universal love, love only for, if you join in, acceptance, forgiveness, um, condemning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7705" target="_blank">02:08:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, these are the things that people resonate with or that serve as separators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7710" target="_blank">02:08:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, um, they're also the things that make us look at some people who, when we go, "Well, that person is freaking crazy."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7716" target="_blank">02:08:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7717" target="_blank">02:08:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, like, I mean, you didn't really have to see David Koresh speak for more than a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7722" target="_blank">02:08:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You didn't even have to know about all the criminal stuff going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7724" target="_blank">02:08:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He had the crazy eyes, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7725" target="_blank">02:08:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, like, the guy's crazy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7727" target="_blank">02:08:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7728" target="_blank">02:08:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And his glasses made him look like Jeffrey Dahmer also, and like, I don't know what's up with those glasses, but, um, you know, like, this guy's, like, eerie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7738" target="_blank">02:08:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You wouldn't let him near anyone you care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7741" target="_blank">02:09:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's this kind of branding issue that I think is important, at least to discuss, because I think when people hear religion, their mind goes to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7750" target="_blank">02:09:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7751" target="_blank">02:09:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not thinking about the practices necessarily, they're thinking about the brand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7755" target="_blank">02:09:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7756" target="_blank">02:09:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if you're not familiar with a religion, same as if you're not familiar with a product, what's going to drive you is the stereotype of the brand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7763" target="_blank">02:09:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the more you look, you realize that those are problematic, um, for good or for ill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7770" target="_blank">02:09:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, you raised the point about the Dalai Lama and, you know, my original reaction when I first saw it was exactly the same as yours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7776" target="_blank">02:09:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, even Buddhism, a religion that is built on the idea of loving kindness and ending suffering, you know, in Sri Lanka right now is being used to justify kind of a genocide against certain groups and the monks themselves are taking up arms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7792" target="_blank">02:09:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And people are shocked when they hear that because any religion can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7797" target="_blank">02:09:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the danger in religion is always that by increasing community for those who are part of your religion, you can be increasing the distance against those who aren't part of your religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7808" target="_blank">02:10:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is why, at heart, the true message of religion is not to make it us versus them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7814" target="_blank">02:10:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's to increase the moral circle of concern such that it includes everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7819" target="_blank">02:10:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the Bible talks about you should honor your father and your mother and be good to your family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7824" target="_blank">02:10:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But more than that, if you're counting the number of times it says who to be good to, it says be good to the stranger, be good to the stranger in your land.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7831" target="_blank">02:10:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's expanding that moral circle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7834" target="_blank">02:10:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But my point is that, you know, people now say, oh, look at the Christian nationalists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7839" target="_blank">02:10:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I would never want to be any part of that. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7841" target="_blank">02:10:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all if you're a person on the left, it's all people who are conservative and looking to control people's lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7847" target="_blank">02:10:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the branding is a big problem, but it, I think, obscures the complexities that are going on in different phases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7857" target="_blank">02:10:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're right. That's going to be the thing that's going to draw you or repulse you, even if it's not accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7864" target="_blank">02:11:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We know from medicine that the more similar that your doctor looks to you and the people you know, the more likely you're going to take their advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7873" target="_blank">02:11:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think similarly, the the more different the the dress of a of a religious figure, the more different their haircut, the more different they speak, the less likely you are to join up with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7887" target="_blank">02:11:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels far away. And so it's going to be interesting to see in the years to come how people gravitate toward or repelled by religion in general or specific religions, given that now pretty much everything is visible to everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI&t=7900" target="_blank">02:11:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.
