Amazon actually got really crushed, even though this past</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">day, they had a pretty decent rally because of their earnings, but they really got crushed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in any event, the trade is what the trade is.

And I think what we learned is that TikTok</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is an enormous threat, and a huge competitive force now in the consumer social app ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The second is that Facebook is fundamentally an app that sits inside of an ecosystem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that is subject to the rules of the platform owner. And that's Apple and Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this IDFA change, so the change in how you can track advertisers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Facebook said is going to have a $10 billion impact in 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3102" target="_blank">00:51:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third thing, which was more implicit, is in order for them to grow, if you can't grow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3110" target="_blank">00:51:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">organically, the only other way to grow is inorganically. And unfortunately, as we're seeing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the regulatory focus on this company is really enormous.
