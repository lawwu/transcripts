It's like, that's how entrepreneurship works. It's like, there's the boss at the top and there's the shareholders and there's all the employees. And the way that you build a profitable business or have, you know, a successful company is that you need to get some level of return on your investment on your employees.</p><p>Naturally, entrepreneurs default to trying to get as much out of their employees, you know, as they can, right? It's like the revenue multiple or profit multiple that you get for your employees. And so your company is always going to set limits and they're going to try to push those limits and they know more about those limits than you know about those limits.</p><p>And they're thinking about you, the person, and they're like, how do I give this person enough to keep them happy and to keep them here and to stay? They're thinking about how to keep you just happy enough. So this is important. If you just accept what they're offering you, if you don't go in and push a little bit where you can, naturally, you're going to get pigeonholed with a lot of limits around your life that you didn't set.</p><p>And it's going to be difficult to escape from them.</p></div></div></body></html>
