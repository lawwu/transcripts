announced this, but it was at our Data and AI Summit last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was announced among like 100,000 other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that we finally released our text-to-image model, which has been a year in the making through a collaboration directly with Shutterstock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a lot of work put into finding a data set that we were comfortable with working on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and trying to build a model that, honestly, I felt like I could trust and that others might be able to trust to put out in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that model was released last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's unfortunately just available via API due to the fact that the data is quite sensitive and quite valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's Shutterstock's entire business in a lot of ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm still really excited that there's now a model that is trained on a data set where the provenance of every single image is known.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a damn good model, so I'm really proud of the team on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Josh, do you have any thoughts on image model questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is not my area of expertise, but I was excited to see the release of it last week as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and very happy that you guys did a nice job on the data side of everything there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was cool to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what's unusual is, I think Shutterstock's doing multiple deals in multiple labs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is the Shutterstock model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess, is this the house model for Shutterstock?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this Databricks' version of the Shutterstock model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The way that I would think about it is that Shutterstock is doing an amazing business in AI across the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Their data set is widely known to be the best stock photos data set in the world, the most comprehensive, the biggest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about what data set am I going to train a multimodal model on, you call Shutterstock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at least I've heard in the news, like OpenAI, Google, Meta, Apple have all called Shutterstock and made those deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of models have had Shutterstock data incorporated into them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is the only model I know of so far where it was exclusively and specifically trained just on the vanilla Shutterstock data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was nothing else mixed in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't go and scrape the web and find other data or combined data sets or anything like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is, in some sense, the house blend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the other piece is that it's just a data set where the provenance of every image is known in public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where did the data come from?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is the Shutterstock collection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing less, nothing more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And certainly being at Databricks, if I've learned one thing, it's I've learned about enterprise customers and what they want out of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things they ask for most is just what can you tell me about the data the model was trained on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here, especially for text to image models where images are just tricky subject matter, there's been a lot of kind of legal conversation about images, especially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's nice to just have something where I can point to it and say, you know, you want to know where the images came from?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These are what they are and this is how they got there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I will talk a little bit about Databricks because it's relevant to the rest of today's episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span

logo that, you know, you'll probably see around a little bit more because, I mean, DBRX is a mouthful, but DBRX, like, you know, it's just kind of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

people to make their own models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think right now training foundation models from scratch is like a very difficult, time-consuming, expensive, kind of risky endeavor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially for smaller companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the things that we're releasing hopefully make that at least a little bit easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the things that we're releasing fall into kind of three different buckets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One is infrastructure and scripts for dealing with the kind of hardware and hardware failures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And understanding how well is the actually lowest level of things actually working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can actually do your training at all and at a reasonable speed without having to constantly restart, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So infrastructure and training scripts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A second set of things is around the evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So after you've trained it, how well is this actually working?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do you know how well it's working?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're releasing a whole bunch of different data there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A new

target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where we've gone through and kind of cleaned up the data as much as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By looking at all the ones that models get wrong or that are flagged for ambiguity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And also our own kind of private reproductions of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where we've done like a kind of clean room black box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, okay, this is what the data set is supposed to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here are some examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's make our own version of this to make sure that there is no data contamination, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To make sure that we're actually, you know, not testing on train.</span></div><div

there is around 450,000 human judgments about ambiguity and question quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which we used in the process of cleaning these evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also hope will be helpful for other people training kind of similar models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third thing is CARBS, our hyperparameter, our cost-aware hyperparameter optimizer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which was especially helpful for being able to experiment at much smaller scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then scale those experiments up to the much larger scale.</span></div><div

retry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want to be training, you know, 10, 20 different 70B models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:08:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the ability to kind of tune things very precisely and learn scaling laws not just for, you know, the like data and flops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But also for learning rate and all the other hyperparameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And see like how should you scale these things up was extremely valuable to us as we were training the larger models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a bunch of stuff we'll have to go through all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I just want to throw in how excited I am about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the stuff that nobody ever talks about that is the difference between success and failure in this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, can you get your cluster to run?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you get software on your cluster?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=558"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if something breaks, you have to go figure out what broke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your job stops, you have to

target="_blank">00:09:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A basic MPI hello world that has the GPUs talk to each other is hard enough, let alone actually training a model, let alone getting good

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there's so many levels of things you have to accomplish.</span></div><div

much discussion about some of these other things that we think are pretty important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=614"

<span class="t">It has been a pain in the butt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's a lot of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my favorite failure was a GPU is just giving wrong math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if they give errors, great, cause you can see the errors, but if they just give you the wrong math back, not so fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When did they give you wrong math?</span></div><div

things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, the numbers come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not the numbers that they're supposed to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's important to say at this stage, just cause like it, I think it goes without saying for Josh and I, but it's worth saying here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't to say that like anything is wrong with us.</span></div><div

Mellanox did a bad job or the, like the server builder, the data center operator, the cloud provider, like the million other parties that are involved in building this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We are running these insane chips that are huge and complicated and built on tiny transistors at insane frequencies with insane heat in data centers that for the most part were not built remotely for this kind of power or heat and have been retrofitted for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like failures happen on a good day with normal CPUs and this is not a good day and not a normal CPU for the most part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, you know, it's fun to joke about all the weird things we see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not to say anybody's done anything wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just kind of part and parcel of working on a massive cluster running at multiple megawatts of power at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So optical cables, like all sorts, like everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll take the opportunity to start in going to the sort of infra piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's, there's just like a distribution of the infra just to give people a sense of what we talk about when we talk about massive clusters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm just going to read off the blog post here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This post is about one cluster that has 4,092 H100 GPUs spread across 511 computers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They use unified fabric manager nodes, which manage the infinite band network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you talk a little bit about your networking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there anything unusual about this setup that you'll call out to people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, actually, this particular cluster is a little bit non-standard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The normal vanilla setup for these large clusters, as vanilla as it can be, is what's normally like a 127 node cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So closer to like 1024 GPUs instead of 4,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here we have a larger cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you start to get into the larger clusters, the networking becomes a little bit more custom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a little bit more, it's a little bit trickier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a little bit more difficult to get these things to all be able to talk to each other at the same speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this has, in this particular case, this is a three tier network architecture instead of two tiers, kind of the normal one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So most of the clusters are a little bit smaller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you get to even larger scales, then it becomes, this becomes even much more complicated, much more expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we chose this particular scale, kind of knowing our own workloads and kind of what we wanted to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was kind of the right size for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, I think it's, it's, you know, it's not exactly vanilla already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's already getting into kind of the custom territory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Is this, is there any, so my understanding is that there, and for the, for what it's worth, I don't know if this is on the record or whatever, but you can just tell me to strike it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there any, is there any part of this that comes with the Voltage Park deal that you guys had?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is like, is that, is that part of the hardware that you got from the deal with them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so we worked really closely with Voltage Park to set up their, all their clusters and infrastructure and everything and kind of decide even like what to order, how should like, how should the networking work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we were very involved in kind of the construction and bring up of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what this post is about, is about that process of like bringing up all these, there's like different clusters in different places of different scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this particular post, we're talking about this one 4096 GPU, but there are other clusters that they have as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were very closely involved with figuring out the exact architecture and kind of the trade-offs that go along with picking, you know, those exact components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You really don't want to like place the wrong order cause it takes months to get it and it's very expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, we were happy to help out with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then your infinibit cables get stolen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We wanted to make sure that we ended up with compute that would work for us and that would also work for their other customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we kind of helped design something so that we would get exactly what we were looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We knew that these kinds of details would be super important and that getting down to the level of the hardware and like having these good scripts and everything was going to be a core part of like actually getting this to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm very glad that we did that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that most companies kind of take that like, you know, full stack approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But for us, it certainly paid off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's basically sort of built to spec.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's interesting that relationship because you usually, for the rest of us who don't operate at your scale, we take whatever we can get from cloud providers, but you are basically co-designing from a single machine up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you described that a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to take us through the process that you described here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so for the actual, like the blog post and kind of bringing these machines online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I think the process as we have it broken down in the blog post, there's kind of a few different layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First is like getting the individual machines to work at all and then getting the machines to actually be able to talk to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So getting the InfiniBand networking to work and then getting to a point where, you know, not just the machines are working and they can talk to each other, but everything is actually working correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a big gap between like it's working at all two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's working perfectly correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after you have all this stuff working perfectly correctly, nice and healthy, then now you get into kind of the software data like training issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after that, you're still not done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like now, even once you're training at full speed, things are going to fail over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Things are going to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's going to be new firmware updates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like how do you kind of deal with this change and flux over time without going crazy and pulling your hair out, trying to like reproduce things or understand why there were regressions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a lot of work to kind of automate the infrastructure tooling as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And kind of the first step, like bringing these things online in the first place, you know, you have hundreds of machines at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't necessarily want to be like walking around with like a CD-ROM or a USB drive, like plugging it in with your keyboard, like hitting next, next, next on the OS install.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not how this works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You do that for one machine and then you use, we use this thing called Metal as a Service to bring up all the other machines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a kind of server that can kind of install the operating system on these other machines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So most like when you're talking about these machines, like each machine is, you know, on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they usually come with a kind of out of band management interface as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they don't, they have their InfiniBand networking, they have their normal 100 gigabit per second, Ethernet networking is like dual redundant, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you also have this extra out of band management network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can log in and you can see like the boot screen or you can see the blue screen of death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can like get in there and actually see what was wrong, which is pretty fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it makes it like possible to automate a lot of this work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the beginning of that and the blog post goes into much more detail about like exactly how we set these up and kind of the other areas that we ran into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're bringing these online, you'll definitely have failures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if they all worked in the factory, they get shipped, some parts come loose, something fails, something goes wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're bringing them online, there'll be some that don't quite work for all sorts of reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you start to be working with machines at this scale, like, you know, if something happens one in a thousand times, you're like pretty likely to see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can get pretty rare, weird things, especially since we had fairly early builds and fairly early versions of this hardware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like these are some of the like first machines that were ever produced, some of the first GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've got some extra special things there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We definitely worked with Dell, for example, on making fixes in the firmware level to be like, okay, like this thing is wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we need to update this at the firmware to like actually fix this particular thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we worked pretty closely with Dell and Nvidia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's what I'm saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like this stuff gets complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing is like, you know, taking a step back, the whole reason we're doing this, right, is that we knew that this was going to be complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There would be these kinds of failures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we're just using, you know, AWS or some other cloud provider, these errors are still going to be there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're going to have no way to know and no way to debug this and no way to diagnose what's going wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we would much rather be able to like call up Dell and say, hey, this isn't working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're like, yep, okay, cool. See if I get together. Oh, I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, cool. We'll ship a firmware update and actually fix this for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a much better experience than like, great, just magically fails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess we restart and hope that that machine goes away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's not a very good place to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, that's kind of the first place is getting to a place where like GPU training is working on your single node machines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can observe stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have tons of tooling around like, you know, Prometheus and all sorts of other tools for understanding what's going on in these machines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want to be like logging into each one and looking at the temperature or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You really need to have tooling to collect all these metrics, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, all of the scripts that we have for this are like for this entire cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for all this infrastructure are a little bit like special purpose for our particular thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not that every script that we have, it's not you can just like take this and plug this in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if we did open source all the tooling that we have, you'd still have to do like a lot of work to open source it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we are releasing is as many of the things that we can that are going to be useful for other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're still going to have to have some way of kind of managing these things, making your own like logging aggregators, etc, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of bringing them up to the like, you know, the single nodes are working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">From there, it goes into I'm happy to keep going if you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I just want to leave the opportunity for John to comment if there's anything that's different from how he runs things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, all I'll say is I'll endorse this and say, this shit is hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, this is really, really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I have a special props to, you know, the folks in Vue, because they were building this from the ground up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, at Databricks and at Mosaic, we typically work with cloud providers, because some of this stuff is just, there's too much to handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot to deal with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this doesn't even get into things like physical security, you know, securing power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're the data center operator, like this gets infinitely complicated and you have to abstract somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, and then you get to the folks who are literally building their own custom chips and like, good God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, my God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's, you know, if you're one of those folks, you're having, you know, pour one out for the infra people at some of the AI chip startups who are having a really, really interesting time right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this stuff is really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think we talk about it much because there's so many other things that are hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the other hard things I think everybody's becoming pretty familiar with at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something that I don't think there's ever really been a comprehensive discussion of, at least not that I've seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so my impression is that you guys, Mosaic, have your own software for sort of spinning up and down machines, just like InView had to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But InView probably, it sounds like InView, you guys went fuller stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know how, I don't know how to describe it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, like Mosaic is not working with Dell on like their firmware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're typically working with like, you know, pick your cloud provider on their Dell firmware or what have you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's kind of, I think, I think one of the things, I don't know, Josh, you can correct me on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of impossible if you're doing training to not go all the way through the entire stack, regardless of what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, somehow I'm still chatting with cloud providers about power contracts, even though the whole point of dealing with the cloud provider is not to have to think about power contracts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Somehow I'm still asking them about which InfiniBand provider they used this time to see if this is part of the bad batch of cables I encountered on that cloud provider or what have you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like, we're still talking about a firmware update from pick your provider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you can't not do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's convenient that they have data center staff who are worrying about what to send back to which provider when.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have people who can go and wait for the InfiniBand cables so they don't get stolen outside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it's kind of, it's impossible not to really go full stack if you're thinking about the infrastructure at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, Josh, correct me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I think that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what we expected from the beginning as well, is that we would have to get inevitably have to get into the details here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm glad that we kind of just planned for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it made it a lot easier from our perspective to have direct control over this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of having to go to the cloud provider that goes to the data center that goes to the supplier, we could just go direct to NVIDIA or Dell or the data center, whoever was responsible and be like, hey, this thing needs to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're like, okay, yeah, that is our responsibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Great, we can fix that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was just a lot easier for us to fix these bugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we had to go through an extra layer of

a uniform failure like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But as it

we've taken the time to dig into a large, maybe larger number than we should have of these failures and get to the root cause of it and be like, oh, okay, that's exactly what's going wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we fix

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You got the NIC health checks,

target="_blank">00:25:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that one is one where we realized that actually like when these machines boot, sometimes they wouldn't actually boot cleanly all the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or when they rebooted, they had problems that they didn't have when they were working before, which was kind of frustrating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like usually if you restart your computer, it gets better here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

like in D message, like every single log line that your computer emits and says like, have we ever seen this before?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

very, very granular detail level what's happening on these computers to make sure that nothing is out of place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's critical because without that, if you're running your training, as Jonathan said, and this thing is slow, like what are you supposed to do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1594"

target="_blank">00:26:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you really, you really want to be very certain that like all 4,000 of these GPUs are working like they're supposed to.</span></div><div

something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And not because of this earlier thing that's like really hard to detect in software later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1607"

target="_blank">00:26:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the, I'm just curious to ask, like, you know, suppose you were to set up another, let's say another H100 cluster and it were at a different data center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And instead of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A decent amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it would go a lot faster the second time.</span></div><div class="c"><span

the health checks, releasing some scripts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.000</a></span> | <span

into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We tried to as much as possible surface those so other people could learn from those and avoid the same mistakes or failures as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it would go a lot faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Although, yes, there would certainly be some things that'd be a little bit different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there'd probably be different CPUs or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I

target="_blank">00:27:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think most of it would apply the second time around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

this in the blog, but I always wonder is what is the timeline that's like kind of reasonable for this amount of work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At least the initial stages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And also what does the team composition look like for setting up a cluster, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what are the mix of skills that you typically would require to get all this going?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.000</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like our infrastructure team is like, you know, fluctuates from week to week, depending on like how many things are on fire and how much we need to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1715"

target="_blank">00:29:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But inevitably, you know, you will have to replace something, which means like taking all the wires out, pulling the thing out, taking all the GPUs out, going and fixing some cable, putting it all back correctly, putting it back in, doing this every time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there's a lot of work that goes into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of people at Dell, NVIDIA, and at H5 that all helped a ton with this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know the exact size of the Dell team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It also fluctuated over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, excellent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, so you have all the hardware set up and now you're firing it out for a single node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a long description that you guys have about just like monitoring the MFU, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what each situation might look, might be indicative of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the most interesting things to me that I saw from here is like, you know, if training immediately starts off at 60 to 80% MFU, something's wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But like, you know, like what are like, you know, some anecdotes or, you know, notable scenarios here that you might call out as maybe counterintuitive or super interesting?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's just so many of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one of them, which I think is probably pretty common, like common knowledge by this point, but like we did have a sort of like, which one was this exactly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for the MFU, like gradually getting worse over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that one, when we saw that the first time we were like, what the heck is going on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why does it get just like a little bit worse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is so strange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what, is it getting lazy or tired or something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1862" target="_blank">00:31:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, is it heat?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what's going on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this particular case, it was memory fragmentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you have hundreds of machines, they're doing garbage collection at slightly different times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they get slightly further apart and slightly more and more jittered until eventually they're all happening kind of at random times and just like really messing up each one of your steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you just turn off garbage collection and call it a day, basically, to be honest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's other things you can do if you want to be a little bit more sophisticated about it, but.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also just manually have it all garbage collect on some interval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's what we've done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We just have a garbage collection callback that just runs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I've seen the exact same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought that one was kind of funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we did trace that one down and look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we did find the actual call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, again, this goes to like having good tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had really good tools where we could look at a bunch of like actual traces in C and be like, okay, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the thing that's taking a lot of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like, you know, this is the thing that doesn't quite line up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, oh, I guess it's garbage collection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, let's just try taking that off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what it was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we can fix it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so for each of them, like basically bugs are not hard if you have good tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you don't have good tools, bugs can be very, very hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So similarly for like heat, another thing that we saw was like, oh, you know, the CPU is getting throttled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, well, it's easy to see if you're monitoring the CPU throttling or monitoring the heat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're not monitoring that, it's really hard to know why it's just suddenly one of them is going slower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I noticed also in the piece that you mentioned FSDP with 0.3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I went to iClear and Guanhua from the DSP team was there presenting 0++.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was wondering if you want to make any call outs to, you know, particular open source or open library</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or open whatever implementation teams that were super helpful in your process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we ended up actually pulling from a whole bunch of different ones to pull things into our own particular pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we use things from NVIDIA's, you know, Megatron stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We use stuff from probably DeepSpeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we pulled in a bunch of different pieces from a bunch of different places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was really nice to see all these working open source, like examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I really appreciate all the effort that has gone into actually tuning these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you can tune them, but it's a lot of work to like tune this stuff and do all this stuff from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really nice to have like a working example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think those are probably the two biggest ones, DeepSpeed and Megatron alone, but there are probably other ones as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there, is there a particular thing in the ecosystem where you would call out as like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2008" target="_blank">00:33:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there should be something here that is open source, but like, it's not really, like everyone kind of builds it on their own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to say something with the file system because everyone talks about the file system eventually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The file system actually was, I mean, we did something kind of dumb there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we have our own sort of local mirror so that we can, you know, like a crappy version of S3 that's local.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's just a pretty simple script, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I think we run like a little web server that just like serves files and then, you know, can upload them and download them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of the reason we did that is that our internet connection in the beginning was not the like full speed one that we would eventually have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we are a little bit more kind of bottlenecked in terms of internet bandwidth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we had this, I think we looked at a bunch of services out there like Minio and some other ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of these like come with a lot of extra overhead and maintenance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And since we already have so much infrastructure to deal with, we kind of didn't want to, you know, bring in a whole other like cloud provider, virtualize something, something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We just wanted something simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we went with that, which is, which has been quite helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the, our tools are usually quite simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like Bash and Python and SSH and Docker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we'd like to keep things simple so that it's easier to debug, like less layers of infrastructure, less layers of abstraction, make it a lot easier to work with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we don't use Kubernetes, for example, I would just directly launch these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just been much easier to debug this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2090" target="_blank">00:34:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One, one tool actually that does come into mind that I will call out is Kraken from Uber.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We love that tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We were a little bit skeptical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Kraken is just, yeah, it's a distributed like Docker registry basically that uses BitTorrent to like transfer things between the machines in a sort of nice optimal way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like in the very beginning, the naive way is like you have this one Docker registry, which was outside of the cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So every time we change an image, you know, there's many gigabytes that each of the 500 machines needs to download.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that just takes a really long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2127" target="_blank">00:35:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this thing does is like just one of them downloads it and then like they all sort of broadcast all the pieces to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was just like a really nice, fast way of getting these images down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was very robust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there's a lot going on under the hood, but I think it's a pretty cool tool that we haven't really had any bugs with it at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, that's all my questions, I guess, for the info piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if, John, you had something that you were sort of burning to ask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All I can say is just same in a lot of places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Plus one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They've done that, seen this, plus one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the one big difference, you know, perhaps in philosophies is we've tried to basically standardize on as much commodity stuff as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just because, you know, I think the reason I asked about trying to do this on multiple different pieces of infrastructure is like, I think we're running on like six or seven different clouds right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And everybody has done something slightly different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And my gosh, the little differences add up, as you know, you've seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, our philosophy has been like, okay, whatever the hell we can standardize, please let's standardize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2191" target="_blank">00:36:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like vanilla off-the-shelf FSDB.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, you know, we wrote our own data loader, but we've tried to make that as much of a standard as we can across our infrastructure and in Databricks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because things just start getting really complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like we use Kubernetes extensively because it at least gives us a uniform set of APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's our hardware abstraction layer to a certain extent for everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just, you know, a difference in philosophy there, but otherwise like, yeah, this stuff is really, really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like we take for granted how much of this, you know, is done for us when you go and you just query chat GPT, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2227" target="_blank">00:37:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, oh my God, everything going on underneath that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's kind of a miracle that the machines boot up, let alone that you can like query a giant language model that's probably doing inference across multiple machines and was trained across thousands of machines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, minor miracle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it is an awesome amount of power that we invoke with a single API call that we take for granted these days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's absurd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, like Kubernetes, like that point about Kubernetes, I will say as a former AWS employee, like it seems like it would be ideal for imbue to at some point make it more abstracted or agnostic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you're going to want to, you know, replicate your setup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We do have our own sort of replacement, but it's just a much simpler version of Kubernetes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Kubernetes is really designed for running services, not for running experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's not its like main architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for us, like we have a thing that's like, cool, you're going to run an experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you want it to run to completion, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the primitives are sort of built around a slightly different style.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that makes it a lot easier, like just a lot simpler to fit the nature of like these machines are going to disappear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They will need to be rebooted for infrastructure upgrades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like something will happen to the GPUs, failures like baked into this as like a core part of our infrastructure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not that we don't have an abstraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2304" target="_blank">00:38:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that it's a sort of simpler, more tailored abstraction for the particular work that we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think it all depends on what your goals are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, I think the challenge in a lot of the deep learning stuff right now is that people are trying to, like people often build things that are more complicated than necessary to get the job done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the complication is the enemy of everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, don't use a fancier parallelism strategy than you have to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't use a fancier set of libraries than you have to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't do anything that you don't have to do because it's hard enough as it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like don't overcomplicate your own life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't try to bring in more tools or more fancy architecture tweaks if you absolutely don't have to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like getting to the minimum necessary to get the job done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really tempting to want to try to use everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like, I totally understand that one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the last piece I'll maybe call out is that I'm just going to weave this in just because I see the opportunity to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there any infrastructure shifts that need to be, that need to rise because of changing architecture?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think, for example, in Vue, like you're announcing a dense model, a 70B dense model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas John just worked on DBRX and the sort of image-to-text, the text-to-image model, which presumably has different bottlenecks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's correct for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we train both dense and mixture of expert models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The one we happened to, you know, kind of get permission to open source was a mixture of expert model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those models are very demanding when it comes to network bandwidth, at least if you're training them in kind of FSTP 03 style.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where there's just a lot of parameters getting shuffled back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And your ratio of kind of compute to amount of data that you have to shuffle back and forth becomes a lot worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you're now, you know, you're only using a fraction of the parameters for every token instead of all the parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we had to really push the envelope on getting all the stuff to the right places on time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so actually the networking part of DBRX was the single hardest thing, I think, of the entire process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just get MOE training, working at scale across a big cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We still managed to, I think, do it all with commodity parts, which was very exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the, like, we were using FSTP and we eventually used HSTP so that we could have, HSTP is a version of FSTP where you have multiple smaller replicas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're doing data parallel within those replicas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2455" target="_blank">00:40:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that helped a lot with network latency issues that we were running into just because we were transmitting so much data, you know, for every single part of the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it actually, like, it was instructive for how Google designs their hardware and software together personally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Their training, as far as I understand, using kind of a 0.3 style of training, it happened for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2475" target="_blank">00:41:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They also train mixture of expert models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2477" target="_blank">00:41:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">TPUs have a very different network bandwidth to compute ratio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2480" target="_blank">00:41:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They have a lot more bandwidth, just objectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And TPUs per chip tend to be a little bit less compute intensive and have a little bit less memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2489"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the ratio of flops to bandwidth is very different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2496" target="_blank">00:41:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that means that it's much easier for Google to be able to pull off some of this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They also have interesting, you know, TOR style network architecture, or TOR style, like, literal network architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like the model, but the network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this the sort of block attention?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I forgot what you call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is just more, yeah, this is more, not the ring attention, but these are the ring all reduces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you have three different dimensions of rings because they, they kind of put you in these three dimensional toruses from what I understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so like, you know, Google's infrastructure in some sense is kind of, I wouldn't say built for this, but maybe the way that Google trains models is built for a slightly different bit of infrastructure they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's kind of neat to think about that, you know, as, as one thing that I think NVIDIA announced for, you know, for, for both the GH200 and the GB200.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this hybrid networking where you'll have blocks of NVLink networked chips?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for the GB200, I think it's like groups of 72 GPUs will all have NVLink to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So higher bandwidth, then you'll have normal networking of some kind, InfiniBand or Rocky or what have you between these blocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's kind of a, you know, it's a change due to the fact that, you know, it's hard to build really high bandwidth networks over very large groups, but it is now a blocked networking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to think about how you architect your model and your parallelism differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You also have to think about fault tolerance differently because it now matters where you lose a GPU, whereas it didn't before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, it's, it's, it's just all really interesting and really fun speaking personally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2588" target="_blank">00:43:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's going to mean new nightmares when we all move to that generation and have to think about, you know, new versions of these problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you go up to larger scales, it gets quite different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like right now, you know, if you're experiencing, let's say, for example, you experience a GPU failure every day, that's fine, just restart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2607" target="_blank">00:43:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you make your thing 24 times as big, now it's once an hour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it stops being quite as easy to just restart, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now you have to kind of break, like bake in this sort of redundancy that you didn't have before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think as you go up in scale, you end up running into like a lot of really interesting problems that also inform the, the actual like design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2629" target="_blank">00:43:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, as an orchestration guy, this is why I always emphasize like very cheap storage or very fast storage so you can checkpoint more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't think that's probably not the best solution for fast, you know, training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2643" target="_blank">00:44:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which works fine when you're doing language and then you move to vision or video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, you have multi petabyte data sets and getting, you know, cheap, fast multi petabyte storage starts to bite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I've certainly encountered issues where the literal data center where my GPUs were did not have enough, you know, object store to fit the data sets that people wanted to bring into that data center from whichever users were, were trying to bring them in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you get to a whole different world of hurt where you have to keep your data in a different region because the region is just out of storage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So things get fun really fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaking of vision, Josh, actually, you know, Embu is an agents company, but you're only, you're announcing a text only model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2688" target="_blank">00:44:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where does, where does the vision side come in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we've actually done a lot of work in the past and people can see kind of our blog posts about sort of self supervised learning and some other kind of vision related stuff in the past as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're very familiar with, with that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think our main focus right now is on kind of, as we say, coding and reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there, there's certainly a visual component to some problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it's not necessarily required for all problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually we found that for most of the kind of like code writing and reasoning problems that we care about, the visual part isn't really a huge important part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes if you really need to, you can maybe describe the thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are other like, you know, multimodal models that you can use off the shelf to sort of plug in for those particular pieces that you need, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if something is driving a browser or whatever, like you can sometimes get away with not having to have that baked into the original model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So our focus, you know, in a sense, we kind of do a lot across the stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're working on our own infrastructure and pre-training and RL and fine tuning and products and everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in another sense, we're very narrowly focused on the application side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of the stuff across the stack is kind of going toward like a very particular purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that particular purpose right now doesn't really need vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we think that people are going to make all sorts of really cool image models like Jonathan, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all sorts of interesting multimodal models into the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll let them go do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll take advantage of that, partner with those people in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And right now we're really focused on kind of like core reasoning and coding capabilities and aspects of the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to go into Carbs since like that's like kind of the next layer of the stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about Carbs in the first episode with Kanjin, because you've actually had a blog post about it like a couple of years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe let's introduce it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Has that been a couple of years now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it must have been at least one year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully it's not a couple of years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm counting AI time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2804" target="_blank">00:46:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was going to say, you're making me feel really old right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I count everything before the General Intelligent Rename as like, you know, prehistory and now sort of modernity, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I actually thought Carbs was more about hyperparameter optimization in a sense of like sort of parameters, hyperparam search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas, you know, when you introduced it, especially in this blog post, it's more about scaling laws and predictability of like, are we sort of in the right ballpark before we scale things up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2838" target="_blank">00:47:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe sort of recap the history of Carbs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2841" target="_blank">00:47:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it really is a little bit of both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Carbs is, it's maybe a backronym, but it's for Cost-Aware Pareto Region Bayesian Search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is about technically how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But Carbs is like, you know, we like pastries and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the point is that it's a cost-aware hyperparameter tuner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So most hyperparameter tuners, you kind of say, OK, here's this objective function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to make this number as big as possible or as small as possible, whichever direction you want to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, just go make this number, you know, as small as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so it'll try a bunch of different hyperparameters, a bunch of different configurations to figure out, like, how do I tweak your network and architecture, et cetera, to get the kind of best performance I possibly can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2888" target="_blank">00:48:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's usually saying, like, you know, almost all of these hyperparameter configurations, let's say they're all going to use the same number of GPUs or the same number of nodes, so it's going to run for the same amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can get a number out, and that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what Carbs does is it says, OK, actually, what if we relax that constraint?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What if we say each of these different points, we're going to model how expensive it will be to sample this configuration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what if we train with just 1/100 of the data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, how well can we do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What if we train with 1/10 of the data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What if we train with all the data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That way, you can understand, like, as we get more and more data, as we spend more and more compute, as we make a bigger and bigger network, how does performance change with these things that change, like, how expensive it is to even explore this data point?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So by doing that, we can see the scaling laws for not just, you know, the scaling laws from, like, the, you know, Chantilla paper, but scaling laws for all parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see how does the number of layers change with this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How does the, you know, the learning rate change?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2943" target="_blank">00:49:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do the, like, you know, various types of regularization change?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see these nice scaling laws.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you're going across costs, like, how should this be changing as you're scaling up your model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that, coupled with the kind of metric that we chose, which is a very precise way of measuring performance, allowed us to really, like, hone in on parameters that worked really well and understand, like, how do we want to scale those up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially as we're changing things about the network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, one of the things that we did is we used a custom tokenizer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As we change this tokenizer, it changes a bunch of other things about the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how should we scale up this entirely new tokenizer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, no one has ever made a model this large with this tokenizer before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so how do we want to change all these things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Harps kind of shows you, like, look, as you change these parameters, like, these other ones are kind of dependent on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, this is the, these are the relationships between them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can better understand, like, okay, if I'm going to scale this up 10x or 100x, like, where do I want to be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can only go so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, we did run, like, I think maybe it was like a 14b one or something like that to check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, and so we had a bunch of, like, 1b, a 14b, and then a 70b.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we had a, I think we just did, like, one at 14b.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can, we get to check to, like, oh, is this on the curve?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, is this where we expect it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was, like, right there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3013" target="_blank">00:50:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So then, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Go on to the next one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, that makes a lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder if, so one of the key questions, and correct me if I'm wrong, but, like, usually people do search or do their evals just based on loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you actually evaluate based on, you know, the sort of end-state evals that people might expect, like HellaSwag and Lombata, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3041" target="_blank">00:50:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the norm here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a norm?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I don't know if it's 100%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I only see loss on most people's reports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's easy to, like, loss is very nice because it's very precise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will tell you, like, very fine-grained differences between, like, really small changes in your hyperparameters or network architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas, especially at the smaller scales, if you're looking at, like, accuracy, it's very noisy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it might be zero or 100 or, like, you know, fluctuating by, like, 10 or 20 percentage points, which makes it really hard to tell, like, did that change actually mean anything?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So our loss is sort of a combination of these two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of saying, like, let's just look at perplexity, we say, let's look at perplexity on the task that we care about for multiple-choice questions, effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're saying, like, yes, this is formulated as a multiple-choice question, and we're going to look at the, like, you know, the loss, the perplexity for this particular answer token.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that ends up being something that's, like, both targeted to what you actually care about and also very precise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The nice thing about this, though, is that it's independent of the data that you train on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing that's annoying about perplexity or about loss is that as you change your dataset, this is really obnoxious because now it fundamentally changes your loss, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can't tell, like, how do I tweak my dataset?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3113" target="_blank">00:51:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But because we have this held-out evaluation dataset where we're looking at perplexity, we can actually change the data mix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so CARBs actually control what is the mix of data that we want to see, like how much code, you know, how much internet text, et cetera, in order to figure out what is the best optimal mix of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That because we have this other metric.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was one of the things that was really, really helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there is a trend overall about changing data mix as training goes on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know how, you know, we're deciding not to talk about datasets in this podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what have you observed about the changing data mix question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We did some experiments and we've actually talked to a bunch of researchers who are doing work here as well and looking at kind of their experiments on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3164" target="_blank">00:52:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were originally pretty hopeful because it sounds like something that should work and make sense, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, oh, cool, like maybe you would have your model, like, learn the basic features and then over time it could get really good at these complicated math problems or coding or something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it just turns out that, like, yeah, it's just not the way it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, oh, we've done so many experiments and you can get like a tiny, tiny little boost from this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it just is not like, it's just not the important thing, at least in the experiments that we've seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, we've kind of, we're letting other people explore that more if they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that just doesn't seem like the most promising direction for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've had some surprisingly good luck with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3199" target="_blank">00:53:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We just released a paper on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The details matter a lot and it really matters what you're trying to do with the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's been, it's been quite effective for us, depending on the setting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And certainly when we're thinking about domain-specific models, this helps a ton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, to a certain extent, you can always think of this as like early fine tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3218" target="_blank">00:53:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, I, like, there've been little glimmers of this in the literature for years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, especially, I think the Gemini 1.5 paper mentions this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't remember whether the Llama 3 paper mentions this, but it's kind of, it's one of those, like, people have different ways to get to these endpoints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, there are the architectural tricks that each lab has to mitigate loss spikes or what have you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And everybody's got, you know, their own bag of tricks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3245" target="_blank">00:54:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it leads to kind of sometimes this contradictory information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not contradictory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">People are just kind of exploring different parts of the space in some sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are lots of ways to get a great model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But certainly for us within our config, and it seems like, I guess, for the folks at Google within kind of the part of the world they live in, changing the data set has helped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the details matter a lot, and it's really hard to get those details right for the reasons Josh, you know, just mentioned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there's a lot of search involved, and you essentially have to make hard choices about what parts of the space you're going to search and which ones you're going to leave be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, some people have done an amazing job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I think the, who is it, the DeepSeek folks have done an awesome job looking at, like, batch size warmup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's been really, really fruitful for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, other people are looking really hard at things like datamix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it just gets tricky to look at everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think we've found that, like, we could get some things that looked like gains from data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3296" target="_blank">00:54:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things that I like about carbs is that when we applied carbs to, like, properly tune things, then a lot of those kind of evaporated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas, like, if we just tune these other parameters, actually, we can get almost the same gains without having to do this more complicated thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, at least in the experiment, in the settings that we've, like, in the particular metrics that we care about, we haven't seen these kind of, like, pan out or scale up in quite the same way, but not to rule it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think you're right, Jonathan, that there probably are a lot of, like, details that go into, like, exactly what is the metric, exactly what is the data set, exactly which, like, what schedule are we using for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I certainly wouldn't rule it out working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Quick question about emergence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Doesn't emergence throw a spanner into the theory of carbs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, so there is a paper of which I really liked and I think informed a little bit of how we thought about this, which is "Are Emergent Properties of Language Models a Mirage?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3356" target="_blank">00:55:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think if you look at that paper, it actually makes a relatively compelling case that, in fact, you know, this emergent behavior that you're seeing is not really emergent behavior, but is really a function of the evaluation metrics that we're using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3370" target="_blank">00:56:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you look at accuracy as a metric, what's happening is that accuracy is actually going up continually over training, but it's in log scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it starts out at 0.001%, 0.1, 0.1, 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Only when you're going between 10 and 90 do you see this happen, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3386" target="_blank">00:56:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you go from 1 in, you know, 1,000 getting right to 1 in 1,000 getting wrong, like, there's many orders of magnitude happening here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're looking at this in perplexity, then you just see this nice straight line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3395" target="_blank">00:56:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's actually what carbs is exploiting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, since we're, since our metric is in this kind of, like, perplexity log space, like, you can see, like, oh, it's just, like, getting better as you make it bigger in this nice, very predictable way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3406" target="_blank">00:56:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that, and that is exactly what we saw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, these things were really, really bad at, you know, predicting the multiple choice answer, just always guess A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, it's so terrible at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3416" target="_blank">00:56:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was like learning to be less confident about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3420" target="_blank">00:57:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One trick I saw from one of the papers recently was just, like, just randomize the order of the multiple choice questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3426" target="_blank">00:57:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you, if that hits the performance a lot, then they're just basically memorizing the test set, which makes a lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is, I mean, you know, I completely agree with what Josh said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the, you know, my bigger lesson is that anything can look however you want it to look if you put it in a log scale to a certain extent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we love our log scales in deep learning for various reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything looks very clean on a log scale until everything looks very flat on a log scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3461" target="_blank">00:57:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I, like, log scales always mix me up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's all I can say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the last thing I was going to mention on Carves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3470" target="_blank">00:57:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, well, I mean, let's just kind of go right into evals because I think that's going to be the sort of crowd favorite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Carves, we already mentioned, you know, leans heavily on the sort of end evals that we would typically eval LMs on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3484" target="_blank">00:58:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Except that you had to make your own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3486" target="_blank">00:58:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a lot of documented problems with many of the common evals out there and you fixed all of them, it sounds like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know about fixed all of them, but I think in the same way that we like to dig into the infrastructure and hardware and understand, like, what actually is going wrong?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what is the actual error on this machine with this GPU and why did that happen and how do we fix it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3508" target="_blank">00:58:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We take the same approach to the evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we looked at the evaluations and actually looked at the data sets, you know, what we did is like, OK, if we're going to be, you know, evaluating natural language understanding and reasoning, like, let's look at all the data sets that are out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's actually look at a bunch of the examples and say, like, is this a good data set that we should use for evaluation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3526" target="_blank">00:58:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's kind of how we selected the evaluation data set that we had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3530" target="_blank">00:58:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when we looked at the actual examples in there, we noticed, like, a lot of these are very messy, like some of them messy to the point of, like, incoherence and some of the ones that we didn't choose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But even the ones that we chose, like, people tried pretty hard on these data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They did try and clean them, but there's just a lot of data points in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3546" target="_blank">00:59:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just easy to make mistakes, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3548" target="_blank">00:59:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, it's not that they have 100 people looking at every question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3551" target="_blank">00:59:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's just way too expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3553" target="_blank">00:59:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you end up with questions that just don't make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody didn't really see this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody just clicked the wrong box for the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or the question makes sense in your head when you write it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've often seen this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not even like malice or incompetence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3564" target="_blank">00:59:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really just like, you know, you write this, you write it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're like, this makes sense to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3567" target="_blank">00:59:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You show it to another person, like, that makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You show it to a third person, they're like, this makes no sense at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because you're kind of, you know, using a different meaning of the word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they say that, you're like, oh, wow, you're right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3576" target="_blank">00:59:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is actually really confusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easy for things to kind of make sense in our own head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we did for the evaluations is really dug into the details of each of these data sets and tried to ask, like, what makes a good question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What makes a good answer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3591" target="_blank">00:59:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what does it mean for it to be ambiguous?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3593" target="_blank">00:59:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had a whole, like, we looked at lots of data, broke this down, asked lots of people about all these different questions to build a model of this and help us kind of clean these data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was sort of one big piece of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A second big piece was making sure that our data that we're training on is not data that we're testing on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there we kind of took a step back and said, like, OK, well, let's just reproduce, you know, 500 to 1,000 examples for every single one of these data sets ourselves and just make sure that this data is definitely not in the, you know, the training set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we did that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3624" target="_blank">01:00:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're able to, like, now be confident about, like, our performance of our model and also performance of other open source and other closed source models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there's a lot there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3635" target="_blank">01:00:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You had 11, I don't know how many data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One, two.</span></div><div

definitely read the whole paper as you're looking at some of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the GSM8K one is a little bit weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one that was kind of funny was, like, low performance on ethics from some of the more recent models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3675" target="_blank">01:01:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that was a little bit funny because the models, you know, I think there was a reaction to, like, oh, no, like, you know, the models are saying bad things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3682" target="_blank">01:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they went way, way in the other direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3683" target="_blank">01:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, like, on the ethics data set, it's always like, this is totally unethical, even though it's really fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3689" target="_blank">01:01:29.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not to say that it's necessarily like a flaw of the model, but just kind of like, you know, political or tuning opinion.</span></div><div

performance is, like, once you fix these ambiguous examples, a lot of these benchmarks are really saturated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3713" target="_blank">01:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I think it's important to look at, like, you know, like, when you're talking about performance on ANLI or race or pool queue or something, like, what you're really talking about is, like, performance on questions that make no sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3725" target="_blank">01:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's just like, did it guess the answer in this, like, really weird scenario?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, those are the ones that are left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, when you look at the performance on the ones that actually make sense to everyone, all the models agree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We agree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, everyone's on the same page, which I think is kind of a really interesting result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The question then becomes, you know, what are the new, like, set of evals that would be like the next frontier that often embeds with it your idea of what reasoning is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3753" target="_blank">01:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because obviously you're super interested in reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, I mean, like, where does this, where does the state of evals go from here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This work and this blog post is talking mostly about the public evaluations and the things that we can release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We do have our own internal evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, one of them that we are releasing is the code understanding evaluation, which is about predicting, you know, what will this variable be or asking questions about code, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3779" target="_blank">01:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is one of the early benchmarks that we made that we can release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can partly release it because we can generate an almost infinite amount of this data because these are programmatically generated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, we're not really worried about there being like corruption in the kind of the training or test set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that makes it a little bit easier for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's, you know, we have built other data sets as well that we can't release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3801" target="_blank">01:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them, you know, for example, because they maybe use other open source code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3805" target="_blank">01:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can't redistribute it necessarily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Other ones, because, you know, that's I think evaluations and data are like a core important part of, you know, the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we take evaluations very seriously and are spending a lot of effort in terms of like, what exactly do we make as part of the evaluation set?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you evaluate these things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3822" target="_blank">01:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've done a lot of other stuff, you know, since these evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think a lot around like code understanding for us, since that's our main focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a nice like place to explore reasoning as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3834" target="_blank">01:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds like you talk a little bit about like code understanding as like sort of variable level, like sort of very micro context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a sense of like larger code context as well?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3844" target="_blank">01:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know what I mean by that, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3845" target="_blank">01:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's mostly just like if I told the senior engineer to go look at a code base, they would understand at a broad level the architecture, but also the design decisions and be able to tell me that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if that's useful or not, but I mean, that's useful to me as someone who might be working with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This particular data set is like the more low level code understanding, like just literally what happens in this code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is mostly because, you know, this is part of the CARBS tuning metric, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3871" target="_blank">01:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we care about the low scale version of this as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We want smaller scale models to be able to do something on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3877" target="_blank">01:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's kind of the focus for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully this is more useful for other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yes, those other questions are also quite interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3884" target="_blank">01:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They get a lot harder to evaluate, like, is this a good architecture or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3888" target="_blank">01:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you and I could probably debate for a while on, you know, different architectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it becomes a lot trickier to do these evaluations as they become more realistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3896" target="_blank">01:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's one of the things that we've been playing around with a lot, especially around like code generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3901" target="_blank">01:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're saying, you know, implement this function, OK, it can be kind of objective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3905" target="_blank">01:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, even MBPP, we've made our own internal version of this data set, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where we've taken like every single example and looked at it and then like, does this actually make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what is the type signature?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3915" target="_blank">01:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, can we, you know, remove all ambiguity, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3918" target="_blank">01:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you basically like reviewed every single question on, I mean, that's impossible for like HelloSwag, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3923" target="_blank">01:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, we didn't do that for HelloSwag, but this is for MBPP, which is only like a few hundred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just sat down and did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3931"

target="_blank">01:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I've taken a quick look at SweetBench.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I like that it's a much more difficult kind of coding, code related task for bug fixing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it gets into some of these problems where it is a lot harder to evaluate these things once they get more realistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3964" target="_blank">01:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we were looking at the AgentBench paper, I think, just last week for our paper club.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3969" target="_blank">01:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that we noticed is that actually like both of the examples in the appendix that are given as like traces where it got it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=3976"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4011" target="_blank">01:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Evaluation is the single hardest part of the whole thing.</span></div><div

the time on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think

feel like people tend to go and get into one situation or the other, like evals don't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4053"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do I do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4059" target="_blank">01:07:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think like a lot of things in deep learning, we have to make peace with just complete imperfection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the most

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet we can still cobble things together and make something interesting happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4074" target="_blank">01:07:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we were just

class="t">And now we're all the way up to like, how do we measure whether a model performed a complex coding task correctly and everything is broken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet we're still able to make huge amounts of forward progress.</span></div><div

evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think our blog post here is about going really into the weeds on these to figure out like, what does that look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think one thing is like, you know, as you said, we have been able to make a lot of progress without making these perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4103" target="_blank">01:08:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to have perfect evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4106" target="_blank">01:08:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the more interesting work is the stuff that we can't necessarily publish about, which is the imperfect evaluations that we have for, you know, actual coding tasks, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4116" target="_blank">01:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what does this really mean as a person?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4118" target="_blank">01:08:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there, as you said, it's much messier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4120" target="_blank">01:08:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a lot harder to put it out and say like, hey, everybody use this because there's so many rough edges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4125" target="_blank">01:08:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's so hard to like, even say, oh, is this even the right task?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4128" target="_blank">01:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this even the right way to do it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4130" target="_blank">01:08:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4131" target="_blank">01:08:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of intuition that it comes down to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4133" target="_blank">01:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, I think that's where it's critical to do if you actually want to make these systems work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to make peace with living in that in between.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4143" target="_blank">01:09:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that in some sense, when I hire researchers, that's the number one quality I look for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4147" target="_blank">01:09:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, can they be at peace living in a house that is neither clean nor messy, but it's just kind of somewhere in between?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4153" target="_blank">01:09:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And are they okay with that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4155" target="_blank">01:09:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Are they okay with a few dishes being out on the table and a few clothes being on the floor?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4159" target="_blank">01:09:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or will that drive them insane?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4161" target="_blank">01:09:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or will they just end up with all the clothes on the floor and like all the dishes out all the time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4164" target="_blank">01:09:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's kind of, I'm looking for that perfect balance because, you know, we have to operate in this imperfect world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4171" target="_blank">01:09:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, yeah, go ahead and give me the perfect evaluation for programmers or for an LLM that is a program assistant tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4177" target="_blank">01:09:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there is no perfect evaluation, but clearly we've made progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4182" target="_blank">01:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the most important part is just, are we climbing the right hills?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4185" target="_blank">01:09:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is why I'm so excited to see the ambiguity aspect of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We often think we have more room to climb on these benchmarks and it turns out we don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4192" target="_blank">01:09:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or it turns out that actually we're climbing, getting good at the benchmark and not actually getting good at the task we care about underlying the benchmark anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the model, like this is the famous example where if you get a hundred percent on MNIST, your model must be broken in some way because there are four examples mislabeled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4207" target="_blank">01:10:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's, it's that all over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4211" target="_blank">01:10:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Welcome to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4212" target="_blank">01:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4213" target="_blank">01:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the accidental canary in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4216" target="_blank">01:10:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one thing that's actually really interesting about this also is that, yes, like the ambiguous examples are sort of, you know, not that great from the perspective of these particular tasks that we're evaluating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4227" target="_blank">01:10:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually one thing that we're very interested in is ambiguity itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, can we detect whether a task from a user is ambiguous or whether you've, you know, completed a task successfully?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4236" target="_blank">01:10:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like these are actually hard, messy problems, but are really important from like the user experience of using these models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would much rather have a coding agent that will give me back a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4246" target="_blank">01:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it's, it's actually the code doesn't work like 10% less of the time than some other model, but it will tell me a hundred percent of the time when it got, like when it's not sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4255" target="_blank">01:10:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's so much more useful if it can communicate, like, I'm not really sure about this, or maybe there's some errors here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4260" target="_blank">01:11:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then just like, here's some code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4261" target="_blank">01:11:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have no idea if it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4263" target="_blank">01:11:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these kinds of like, you know, detecting ambiguity and detecting correctness or uncertainty, I think are really interesting problems that we're really like digging into quite deeply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4271" target="_blank">01:11:11.000</a></span> |

we were selecting for with these evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4351" target="_blank">01:12:31.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:12:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the ARC ones are like a little bit too probably visual for us to really be able to integrate with.</span></div><div class="c"><span

spend a lot of time getting really good at these kinds of benchmarks without making like, kind of more general purpose progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4374" target="_blank">01:12:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we're a little bit leery of going too far in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4377" target="_blank">01:12:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, like coding

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4386" target="_blank">01:13:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think you can go very far down that route and make something that's like really good at those problems, but not actually that useful as like a programmer day to day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4393"

doing this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4431" target="_blank">01:13:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if you're trying to

indicia of intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4448" target="_blank">01:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's

more down to earth things like having a model that can have a conversation with you about data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4457"

target="_blank">01:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And RAG, you know, in one sense, you know, the way that I think about RAG is it's the world's simplest agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4582" target="_blank">01:16:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is an agent that basically, you know, there's at least more than one thing happening in the process of building a model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4587" target="_blank">01:16:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's at least a system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4588" target="_blank">01:16:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you give the model the ability to decide when it wants to retrieve data from a context or retrieve data from a database, then we're talking about an agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4595" target="_blank">01:16:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So RAG kind of, I think, like, tows that boundary really nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4599" target="_blank">01:16:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a lot of reasons why you do genuinely need a long context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4602" target="_blank">01:16:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I don't think long contexts are problematic in and of themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4605" target="_blank">01:16:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there's some controversy even about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4607" target="_blank">01:16:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the idea of doing like thousand shot tasks as an alternative to fine tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4612" target="_blank">01:16:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the idea of pulling in lots of data into the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4614" target="_blank">01:16:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the idea of once you get into multimodal land, you're just going to end up with giant context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4618" target="_blank">01:16:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of unavoidable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4620" target="_blank">01:17:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The flip side is I don't know of anyone who, like, is hiding a secret passphrase in a book and needs the model to find it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4627" target="_blank">01:17:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Needle in a haystack is, it's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The challenge with long context, to my mind, and Josh, I'm curious what you think, is simply that annotating long context evals is really hard and really expensive, you know, intrinsically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you need someone to read 10,000 tokens or 100,000 tokens or, like, you need someone to read a 1,000 page book or the equivalent thereof in order to measure these long context benchmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4650" target="_blank">01:17:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if a human could solve these tasks, let alone that a human could do this in any amount of time where you're willing to pay the money to get the data annotated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4658" target="_blank">01:17:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so any long context eval has to, in some sense, be correct by construction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4662" target="_blank">01:17:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to, you know, you have to know the answer before you've created the example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4666" target="_blank">01:17:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And needle in a haystack is kind of the simplest way of doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4669" target="_blank">01:17:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the problems with needle in a haystack are well known, you know, it doesn't measure anything real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4673" target="_blank">01:17:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not even testing the model's ability to holistically use the context just to identify one part of the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4678" target="_blank">01:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can do some wacky things to your model, like quantize the hell out of the KV cache and still get needle in a haystack to work quite well because it's not trying to holistically take advantage of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I have some thoughts on things that I like more that are also still correct by construction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4695" target="_blank">01:18:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I really like the idea of doing thousand shot tasks where you can look at the scaling as you go from 10 shot to 100 shot to 1000 shot to fine tuning on that data instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4704" target="_blank">01:18:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I like that as a way to, you know, have something that's correct by construction, at least where you have a nice baseline that you can compare to automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4712" target="_blank">01:18:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm typically looking for like contexts that are situations where long context is one way to solve the task, but not the only way to solve the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4721" target="_blank">01:18:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have some other strong baseline floating around personally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4724" target="_blank">01:18:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, needle in a haystack, not my favorite thing in the world, to say the least.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4728" target="_blank">01:18:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, I agree with most of what Jonathan said, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4732" target="_blank">01:18:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one other thing that I will call it is that, you know, from like a coding application perspective, it's useful to have long context because the lazy thing of just like throw the whole repo in the context is like, okay, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4743" target="_blank">01:19:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, you can just get started with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then in, you know, in real scenarios, you don't necessarily want to put the whole thing in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4750" target="_blank">01:19:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have code bases that are bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4751" target="_blank">01:19:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably want to filter down to the stuff that's relevant anyway to not be confusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4754" target="_blank">01:19:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you probably, even if you did have a lot of context, you might want to sort it in some way to say this is more important than this other stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4759" target="_blank">01:19:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and you know, you don't want to wait for, you don't want to be wasting all this time and compute on inference and like doesn't really matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4765" target="_blank">01:19:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I don't know that it's the most important thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4770" target="_blank">01:19:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people will find creative use cases and like John said, I think the multimodality examples will naturally lend themselves to long context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4778" target="_blank">01:19:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4779" target="_blank">01:19:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then one last one on just general sort of agent related capabilities that we didn't really talk about in eval section is function calling and tool use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4788" target="_blank">01:19:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a recent trend, I think, basically led again by OpenAI on parallel function calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4795" target="_blank">01:19:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's always, there's been a limit on how many tools you can call from four to now, I think 128.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4803" target="_blank">01:20:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think theoretically Claude and Jem and I support a lot more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4807" target="_blank">01:20:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just generally, how do you think about evaling tool use?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4811" target="_blank">01:20:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that super important for you guys?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4813" target="_blank">01:20:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything else?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4814" target="_blank">01:20:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're thinking about it in a slightly different way, which is, yes, you can have this like hard coded list of tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4819" target="_blank">01:20:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if only you could have like this really large open set of like tools, maybe they would be like functions that you could call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4825" target="_blank">01:20:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If only there was like a language or like a programming thing, like being able to write code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4830" target="_blank">01:20:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for us, it's like, well, look, if we can write code, like now you have all these tools accessible at the end of the day, like function calling is just a function invocation, like literally in code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4839" target="_blank">01:20:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think our approach to this is like, instead of worrying about like weird, hard coded agents using tools, like let's just make them able to actually write code robustly and make that code work and be able to debug that code, know if that code is safe to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4851" target="_blank">01:20:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like get really good at the like code writing and execution part of things, because that will open up the action space like far more than, you know, 128 tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4859" target="_blank">01:20:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like just everything is at your fingertips, especially I think over the next few years, like we already have so many really good APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4865" target="_blank">01:21:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As we get better and better at writing code, we'll be able to make APIs to things that don't even have APIs today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4870" target="_blank">01:21:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's, that's kind of how we think about it is less as like a special purpose thing and more as like, this is one of the reasons to focus on code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4876" target="_blank">01:21:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On my end, the way that I think about this is, you know, I think a lot about how models interact with data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4882" target="_blank">01:21:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for me, tool use is really a question of how do you take models that are really built for unstructured data and have them interact with structured data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4891" target="_blank">01:21:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I, and I get the question a lot from my customers, like, what do I do with tabular data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4896" target="_blank">01:21:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or what do I do with like, you know, JSON or what do I do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4900" target="_blank">01:21:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you name it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4901" target="_blank">01:21:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, even what do I do with a PDF?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4903" target="_blank">01:21:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because PDF parsing is still an unsolved problem, even in 2024.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4908" target="_blank">01:21:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the answer, or even just the basic question of like, should I bother to structure my data anymore?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4912" target="_blank">01:21:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Shouldn't I just toss the table?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4914" target="_blank">01:21:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Shouldn't I flatten it and just throw it into the LLM context and like let the model figure it out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4918" target="_blank">01:21:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The answer is no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4919" target="_blank">01:21:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we've built all these fun APIs and fun languages and paradigms for dealing with structured data over the years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4927" target="_blank">01:22:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4928" target="_blank">01:22:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Have your model use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4929" target="_blank">01:22:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Train a model that can interact with these things in a meaningful way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4932" target="_blank">01:22:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's, you know, text to SQL is still, or like having a model be able to make SQL calls in the backend is actually like one of the single most useful things for my customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4944" target="_blank">01:22:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds really boring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4946" target="_blank">01:22:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the models are really good at it and it moves the needle day to day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4950" target="_blank">01:22:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So tool use for me really is that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4952" target="_blank">01:22:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, how do you just interact with structured data sources and take advantage of the fact that you have some prior knowledge about the structure of your data that an LLM would completely flatten away?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4964" target="_blank">01:22:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, in many ways, this is kind of one of the, one of my biggest frustrations with the fact that LLMs work well with code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4971" target="_blank">01:22:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have decades and decades and decades of understanding about the structure and interpretation of programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4975" target="_blank">01:22:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I think that's literally the name of a book on programming, if I remember right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4979" target="_blank">01:22:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, we, you know, we have all this theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4983" target="_blank">01:23:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We know everything there is to know about programming languages, if they're well-formed languages and have the right properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4988" target="_blank">01:23:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet when we have an LLM work with them, we literally just turn it into a token stream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=4992" target="_blank">01:23:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Despite the fact that we know how to parse it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="t">We're still just flattening it into a model and making the model relearn all of these things from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5005" target="_blank">01:23:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it frustrates the hell out of me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5007" target="_blank">01:23:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have a better answer when it comes to code.</span></div><div class="c"><span

function calling are just, in my mind, the right way to deal with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5018" target="_blank">01:23:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think basically what you're saying is like code is the God tool for Jonathan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5022" target="_blank">01:23:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, SQL is so much the right abstraction for accessing all this

class="t">We're going to be releasing this next week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5400" target="_blank">01:30:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I will be deep in my conference, the AI Engineer World's Fair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5404" target="_blank">01:30:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So people can just go to AI.Engineer and live stream it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5408" target="_blank">01:30:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you guys have any other calls to action before we wrap?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5411" target="_blank">01:30:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only one is, you know, we're definitely hiring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5413" target="_blank">01:30:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're interested in working on coding, reasoning, interested in working on all this stuff, you know, from the ground up and really deeply understanding not just how does the hardware work, but how do the models work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5423" target="_blank">01:30:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And also designing these systems to actually be useful for yourself day to day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5427" target="_blank">01:30:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, come say hi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5429" target="_blank">01:30:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the only thing I'll say is, you know, and I like saying it these days, it feels like the field is so crowded and, you know, it requires so many resources to do impactful work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5438" target="_blank">01:30:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, almost on some days it feels like everything's been done or somebody else is doing everything where you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5443" target="_blank">01:30:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At least I remember that feeling every single day of my PhD and even more so now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5448" target="_blank">01:30:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I hope like what you heard from Josh today tells you there is so much enormously impactful work to do in the field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5455" target="_blank">01:30:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If only you take a step back and take a fresh look at some of these things and just talk about what you're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5461" target="_blank">01:31:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a huge amount left to do here and a huge amount of exciting work happening every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5466" target="_blank">01:31:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, for those who are certainly feeling that exhaustion right now, and I count myself among those folks many days, it's refreshing to see these kinds of drops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5477" target="_blank">01:31:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, see that there is so much more, even in things that people feel like they understand, how to set up a cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5484" target="_blank">01:31:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5485" target="_blank">01:31:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, even in these evals that we think we understand, there is still more to understand and still more work to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5491" target="_blank">01:31:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, just I hope everybody's keeping at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5495" target="_blank">01:31:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Keep on keeping on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5496" target="_blank">01:31:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, thanks so much for your time, guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5498" target="_blank">01:31:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was great discussion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5499" target="_blank">01:31:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll put the links in the show notes for people to read more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5503" target="_blank">01:31:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5504" target="_blank">01:31:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5505" target="_blank">01:31:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks, Jonathan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5507" target="_blank">01:31:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Music]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHgk4rhL3g&t=5523" target="_blank">01:32:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div></div></body></html>
