And so this shows you the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4589">01:16:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">average sea surface temperature.

And this is also because of these El Nino</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4596">01:16:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">phenomena.

So off the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4609">01:16:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">coast of Acapulco, the sea surface temperature was 88</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4612">01:16:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">degrees Fahrenheit. I mean, it was so hot, the water like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4615">01:16:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">imagine an 80.

So when a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4622">01:17:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">storm goes over that level of heat, it takes heat out of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4626">01:17:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ocean.

And then the wind speed pulls more heat out of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4631">01:17:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ocean. And that's how these things become escalatory until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4634">01:17:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they hit something cold, like a mountain or the land, the land</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4638">01:17:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is much cooler.

And that's why these things form over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4641">01:17:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">ocean.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4647">01:17:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that's because we've never seen this level of energy stored in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4650">01:17:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the oceans before.
