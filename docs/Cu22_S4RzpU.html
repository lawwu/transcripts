Okay, so and here's how we're going to break the episode down. I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">start with the foundational strategies that make or break most award redemptions. These are things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility, booking windows, search tools, and how to understand program rules. From there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll dive into all the tactics for finding and booking, including sweet spots, hidden availability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">stopovers, leveraging positioning flights, and more. Then I'll get into a few things that I know trip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">people up like fees, travel coverage, and married segment logic. Finally, we'll wrap with some hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">specific advice and a few niche but very helpful tricks for families and Southwest travelers. So whether you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">booking your very first award trip or you've been doing this a while and you just want to keep leveling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">up your strategy, I promise there is something in this episode that's going to help you travel better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">use fewer points and miles than you expected, and enjoy your next vacation even more. So let's start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with flexibility, which is the first thing I want to talk about because the most successful award travelers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">tend to be flexible on some aspect of their trip. But I think sometimes people get caught up on what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility means and they think, "Oh, flexibility, it's just about being able to fly on any date and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">can't do that because I only have specific dates off work." Well, that's not true. When I say flexibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and that flexibility unlocks so much, that could be flexibility with your dates for sure. If you could go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to Europe and you can go anytime, that's going to make it even easier to find a great deal. But it also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">could be flexibility around where you go. So you might say, "I have very specific dates but I'm willing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to go anywhere." It might be flexibility on what airlines you fly on. I meet some people who say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"I really only want to fly Delta." Well, that's going to make it really tricky. But if you're flexible on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I don't care where I go. Or I don't care if I have to change planes a few times. Or if I route</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a different way, like from California down to Florida to get to Europe. That might not be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">most direct path there, but it might be the path that has the best deal. And at certain points of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your journey in this points and miles game, that might be what you're optimizing for. It might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility on which cabin you're in. If you're just trying to redeem first class or business class,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that could be a little harder. Not impossible by any stretch, right? I've done it hundreds of times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're flying economy or premium economy, that might make things even easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then another one that I think a lot of people don't always think about is the flexibility around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">when you can lock in the trip. I know a lot of people who say, "Well, I want to go to Europe and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to go this week. And in fact, I really want to go to Paris." And I say, "Well, the one piece of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility it sounds like maybe you could have is when you book the trip." Because if you wait till</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the last minute, you might get a really amazing deal. Or if you can plan it over a year in advance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you might get the best deal. So deciding when you're going to be able to book that trip is another form</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of flexibility. Because the average traveler is looking to book a trip somewhere around, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">three to four months out. So if you can deviate from that and book it a year out, or if you're comfortable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">waiting until two weeks out, things open up so drastically in that last two-week window that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I would argue that that's kind of the best time to buy. But I'm going to share a few tactics to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that less stressful because I know very well, I've had many conversations with my wife, the idea of waiting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">until a few days before we leave to know that the trip is even happening can be really stressful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are ways to avoid that. And we're going to talk about them. One other thing, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that we are using for a trip to Japan next year is we didn't have flexibility on dates. We didn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility on when we wanted to go. And honestly, with two young kids, we didn't want to be flexible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about the weather we changed stops. We wanted to go direct. And honestly, we wanted to go direct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on a flight in business class. So where we were flexible is we were able to find flights, one from San</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Francisco to Haneda and one from San Francisco to Narita, the two different Tokyo airports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my wife and I, at least right now, and we'll talk about what might change over the next coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">months. But we split up and each of us is on one of those flights with one of our children. And so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is another form of flexibility. So I think you've got to decide where you can be flexible. And the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">flexible you are, the easier it's going to be to find amazing deals. But even if you're not flexible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you can still find great deals. And we're going to walk through a lot of ways that we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to make that happen. The next thing I want you to understand is that almost every airline has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">handful of different airline partners. Now, sometimes those are part of the big three airline alliances,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">SkyTeam, One World and Star Alliance. And sometimes they're just one-off partnerships. Like Alaska has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one-off partnership with Condor, which gives you access to a bunch of flights to Europe from the US,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">even though Condor is not part of the One World Alliance. And every single one of those partners has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">different award price, a different fee structure, and a different way things operate. So just to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">point an example out, I'm going to look at this one flight right now. It's a flight from Boston to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Amsterdam on Delta. And the retail price of that flight right now is $2,700. And you can book it with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Delta miles. It's 240,000 Delta miles plus $6 in taxes and fees. Now, that's a lot of points. Maybe that's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">better deal than spending $2,700 if you really want to be on this flight. But if you look at the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">options, and I'm using a tool called point.me, but we're going to talk about some other tools today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you can actually book that flight for as low as 47,500 points using Virgin Atlantic Flying Club. And at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">first glance, you might say, well, that sounds like a great deal. That's way less than 240,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But Virgin Atlantic is one of the airlines that, depending on the route, can have really high fees. And so the fees on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this flight are $1,054. I think I'd still rather pay 47,500 points plus 1,054 than 240,000 Delta points. And it's even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">better if you have chase points, because right now there's a 25% transfer bonus. So you'd actually only need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">38,000 chase points to be able to have 47,500 Virgin points. But neither of those are as exciting as the fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Flying Blue, which is the frequent flyer program of KLM and Air France, you could book the same flight for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">64,500 points and only $33 in taxes and fees. So let's ignore the Virgin Atlantic option now because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">such high fees and say, Delta, 240,000 points, $6. Flying Blue, 64,500 points, $33. Way better deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you could also book it through Korean Air for 80,000 points. But I'm going to guess most of you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have Korean Air miles because it's very difficult to obtain them if you're not flying on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Korean Air because they're not a transfer partner of anyone. So that's just an example of how it can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">much, much cheaper to go look at other programs. And if you were stuck in the mindset of I'm flying on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Delta, I should book through Delta, you might completely miss the fact that there are so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">great ways to book it. And in this particular case, Flying Blue and Virgin Atlantic are partners of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Chase, Amex, Built, Capital One, Citi, and Wells Fargo. Basically, if you have transferable points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get them to Air France and Virgin Atlantic and get a way better deal than what you'd get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">booking with Delta. Just to paint another example, you can often book American Airlines flights with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">British Airways, Avios, which can be a great deal for short domestic flights. But on long haul flights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Avios similar to Virgin Atlantic often has high taxes and fees. So you'll always want to make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you're looking at lots of different airline partners, but we're going to talk about tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that make that so easy that you almost don't have to think about it. The next is that you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">understand the different rules of those programs. So yes, sometimes they take different miles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes they have different taxes and fees, but often they have different cancellation policies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, depending on how certain you are about this travel and how far out it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">might change how important these policies are. But there's a few airlines that I want to highlight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like Iberia, which might sound like they have a good deal when you see it, but Iberia awards on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">partner airlines are non-refundable. Meaning if you don't take that flight, you cannot get your points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">back. So I would strongly advise you, unless you're looking at a flight that leaves in three or four hours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're at the airport to not book partner flights through Iberia. Etihad is similar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">except they keep somewhere between 25 and 75% of the points, depending on how far out you cancel it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But still, that's a massive, massive penalty. Whereas there are lots of airlines, most of the domestic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">U.S. ones have no fees. Alaska has a $12.50 fee for partner awards. I know that there are a handful of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">European airlines where the fee might be $25 to $50 to $70 to cancel. So in my mind, if I'm planning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a really big family international trip that I'm pretty confident I'm going to take, but the penalty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is $25 or $50 if I have to cancel it and I get all my points and miles back, that's okay. But if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">more speculative where I'm not even sure if I'm going to take it, sometimes I might pay a few more miles to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to book it from a program where I can refund it with no penalty and no cost at all. So that's kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of how I'm thinking about this. A couple of cool, interesting hacks here. So LifeMiles, which is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">program of Avianca, they actually have high penalties for canceling flights that you booked with points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but they have this program called LifeMiles Plus. And I think it's somewhere between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">$20 and $40 a month and you have to commit for six months. Though when you commit, you get this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">monthly deposit of miles, but it completely waives all your award fees. So if you were to book something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and you needed to cancel it and you didn't want to have to pay those fees, it might be cheaper to join LifeMiles Plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and get all those fees waived. Also United has this ridiculously amazing thing where even if you book a flight with points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and you forget to cancel it and you miss the flight, they will even redeposit the miles on a flight that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you forgot to cancel before it took off for only $125 fee. Now, most airlines, I think you're completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">forfeiting your miles if you don't cancel it before departure. In fact, British Airways one time, I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">realize they require you to cancel 24 hours out. And I didn't know that. And I saw a flight that I thought was slightly better. So I booked a different flight than my British Airways flight, forgot to cancel it, and lost $62,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just because I forgot. And that was a painful lesson, but it's just part of the process. So that's cancellation policies. The other really important thing to understand are expiration policies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So many airlines, as long as you have some activity in your account, will keep your miles active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that activity doesn't always have to be flying with the airline. It could be transferring in a thousand points from, you know, one of your credit card programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Many airlines, as long as you have some activity in your account, will keep your miles active. And that activity doesn't always have to be flying with the airline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be transferring in a thousand points from, you know, one of your credit card programs. It could be buying a magazine subscription.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be donating some miles. For example, American Airlines is notorious for canceling your miles after two years if you haven't had any activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you do anything with those points and miles, if you open up a Basque Bank mileage checking account, leave a small amount of money in where it deposits, you know, your interest in the form of miles each month, your miles will never expire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, sometimes airlines have shopping portals, make a purchase through the shopping portal, credit the miles, miles extended.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there are some programs, notably ANA and Japan Airlines, that have hard expirations, and there's not a way to avoid them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a way if you want to go earn millions of miles with Japan Airlines and get into a status that removes their expiration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But for almost anyone listening that isn't so far down the Japan Airlines rabbit hole that they already knew that, those programs you can't extend after, you know, those miles arrive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those are programs where I'd be very, very cautious transferring to unless you were really sure you had a booking to make or you really had a lot of flexibility in the next few years to use those points and miles again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So know the program rules before you transfer.

to be so overcomplicated, they end up getting put off forever, like creating a will or trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=860"

sponsor, because it was quick, easy, and way less intimidating than it seems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">In a few guided steps, we had a solid plan in place to protect our family, and we were able to customize it to match all our nuanced preferences about what happens to our savings, who's going to be the guardian for our kids, and so much more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:15:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The next thing to understand is that every single one of those airlines, both the ones flying and the ones you can book from, have a different window whereby they release seats and make them available to book, and they're able to book flights on partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll link to a great guide that Devin Gimbel, who came on the podcast a few weeks ago from Point Me to First Class, has that you can download of when all of the different airlines open their schedules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, Japan Airlines actually opens their schedule at, I think, 361 days out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They're in the One World Alliance, but American Airlines doesn't actually open up their schedule or let you book until 331 days out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might think, oh, wow, Japan Airlines, I'm going to go grab one of those seats the moment the schedule is open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're planning to book those seats with a partner, and that partner doesn't let you book until 331 days, you're going to have to hope those seats stay there for 30 days before you can book them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's important to understand when different airlines let you book seats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason it's important is because some airlines have a practice where they just specifically drop a certain number of seats every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And Japan Airlines is one of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You can almost always find two business class seats on Japan Airlines on every single route the day they release the schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're trying to book them from a program that doesn't have access to Japan Airlines or does but doesn't have access at 361 days, you'll find yourself in a situation that you can't book those flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So on the Star Alliance side, Avianca lets you book 360 days out, Aeroplan lets you book 355 days out, but United only lets you book 337 days out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So similar process there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">On the hotel side, almost every hotel group lets you book about a year out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Hyatt goes a few months past that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's 13 months around there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Accor, I think it's around 13 months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Radisson, somehow they let you book two years out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think depending on the hotel program and the airline program, you'll want to look these up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll link to a guide that you can download that Devin put together and you can get all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Some other programs have reliable windows where maybe six months out or 14 days out, they release more seats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Lufthansa is notorious for only releasing their first class awards to partners within the 15 days before departure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are tools that make this really easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So seats.aero has a bunch of tools like the Lufthansa first class finder, the Qatar Q suites finder, the Japan Airlines first class finder, where you can actually just look for those routes that are really hard to find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll see right here that Lufthansa's first class is only available in the next three days, but there are 10 routes you can take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to go from Boston to Munich in first class, you could do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's 140,000 points through United.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a way to get access to that ticket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that doesn't mean that United, again, is the only place you can book it, but that's how they're searching this inventory with this tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really my next thing that I want to talk about, which is understanding these award search tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you go back to episode 166 and 167, I sat down with Greg from the frequent miler and we broke down all the best tools for booking flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the next episode on hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not going to do a masterclass on flights and hotel award search tools because I've already done that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll just broadly remind everyone how these tools work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's really two searches you'd want to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of them is a discovery search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And for that, I think Points Yeah has this daydream explorer, which is a really cool thing where you can say, hey, take me from the United States to anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you could say, oh, I'm looking for a beach and I'm looking for something that I can transfer my points to from Amex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd like to find it in business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Tell me what you can find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll just show you all these ideas of what's possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, I'm looking right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I can go to Italy for 55,000 points in premium economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I can go to the Maldives, 35,000 points in economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This is great for when you're really, really flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">These discovery tools that are just like, help me get the most out of my points and miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Then on the flip side, there are flight search tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And they can let you say either San Francisco to Tokyo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Or depending on the tool, some of them let you say San Francisco to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Or West Coast airports to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">The one I probably use the most is Award Tool or Seats.Aero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But almost every one of these tools has both of those features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd encourage you to play around with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of them give you free access to search in a limited window, like in the next 60 days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the paid tools give you a longer window to search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So find the tool that you get the most value out of and explore that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Another tool is Point.me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They recently also offered something like that flight discovery tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They call it Explore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing that I think they really shine at is two or three things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">One, on the search side, I feel like they have a great set of partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They used to have at least the most number of partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you found a flight you specifically want, you just want to know where's the best place to book it for the best deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Point.me has that data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I really feel like they have a comprehensive list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But where they really shine is that they're going to walk you through exactly how to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They also have a concierge where you can spend $100 to $200 per person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And they will go out and do all the searching and do everything for you and walk you through the whole process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So having an award search tool is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">On the hotel side, there's a ways, max my point, and stay with points that are all different ways to search and set alerts for hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of these tools have added hotels as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span

be your favorite tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But definitely go back to that episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">The other tool that I'll include on this list that is a little bit different is called PointsPath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way that tool works is it's an extension that sits on top of Google Flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you search for a flight, it'll tell you, hey, this flight's $419 or 37,500 miles on United.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Use cash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you scroll down, I'm looking right here, $419 on Alaska or 20,000 points, it's a great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Use your points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it layers it on top of your searches you're already doing on Google Flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But it has a very limited number of airlines it supports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's a really good tool for domestic because they include all the domestic carriers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're looking for kind of long-haul, complicated international flights, I don't think it's going to be as helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The other tool I use a lot is called Flight Connections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason I use that is because you can basically search for an airport and it'll just tell you all of the flights that fly directly from that airport.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's pretty helpful if you're thinking, oh, where can I fly direct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Who flies out of this airport?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or when we talk about positioning flights in a little bit, I'll explain how I use that tool as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, I'm hopeful that as AI agents get better and better, they can learn to use a lot of these award search tools and help all this process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But I haven't seen that yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The last foundational tip I want to share is around buying points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Just because you don't have the points in your account doesn't mean you can't take advantage of some of these amazing deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Points are very, very often on sale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the case where sometimes I've been able to get four, five, six cents a point, you can almost always buy points for less than four cents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You can almost always buy points for in the one to two cent range, depending on the program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the hotel side, they're often down as cheap as half a cent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I know I've seen Hilton points and Choice Hotels points down at half a cent pretty regularly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So points are always on sale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Some airlines like Avianca and Air Canada are notorious for putting points on sale all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think Avianca had their points on sale 13 times back in 2023, Air Canada 10 times, Hilton 6 times, British Airways 8 times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say using these award tools to see if there's an amazing deal, even if you're not really deep in the points and miles game, is still valuable because you might be able to buy those points at a price that still makes the flight cheaper than if you paid cash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of some of the foundational stuff that I think you need to know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to be flexible, but not in the way you might think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to look at all the different partners, understand their rules, understand when their schedule is open, find an award tool that you can use to search, and consider the fact that you can buy points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you find an amazing deal and you don't have the points, that doesn't mean you can't take advantage of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's jump into the tactics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one I want to talk about is finding award sweet spots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing that's interesting is that every different airline has a different way that they price flights using their points and miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes they have one way they price flights on their own airline and then another way if you're using a partner airline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of those are dynamic, meaning they don't actually have an award chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't tell you how much it's going to cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't know until you search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of the U.S. airlines have started adopting that program where you just search and it just tells you a price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you've done this enough, you kind of have a sense of, oh, when it's low, it's going to be about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But when it's high, it's somewhat correlated to the flight price and it could be quite expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But other airlines have either distance charts or zone-based charts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Air Canada, for example, on their partner airline chart, there's actually a set price depending on where you go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">For some airlines, that's based on distance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can go up to 12,000 miles or something from a destination and it's going to be the same price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reason I bring this up is because for each program, there are some really, really great sweet spots that can be awesome ways to take advantage of points and miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So Turkish Airlines, for example, charges 7,500 miles for one way and economy within the continental U.S., but that includes Hawaii.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you can find space on United to Hawaii within the U.S., you can get that for only 7,500 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That flight on United might be 25,000 miles or more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">British Airways uses a distance-based award chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can be really fantastic for really, really short flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So flights under 650 miles might be as little as 4,500, obviously, in one-way economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you're going from Miami to the Bahamas or Hong Kong to Taiwan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Being able to do it for that small, small number of points and miles in a scenario where that cash price might be way, way higher and the price that most U.S. programs charge might be way higher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can start to learn if you search for sweet spots getting to a certain place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That can be really, really powerful to find great deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Then on the hotel side, Hilton free night certificates have no cap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the sweet spot with Hilton free night certificates is finding those hotels that cost the most, which in a recent devaluation, I think now it's up to 180,000 or 200,000 points a night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And for people who are using Hilton points, that's a bummer because it might have gone up 50% in terms of the number of points you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have free night certificates, at least right now, that doesn't really matter to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't matter if the hotel is 180,000 or 30,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Those free night certificates work no matter what the price is, as long as it's a standard award.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, sometimes you'll go to Hilton and it'll say 2.8 million points for this room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Those don't work for free night certificates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's their dynamic pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely want to steer clear there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, let's talk about transfer bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I briefly mentioned earlier that, you know, if you were looking at a Virgin Atlantic flight and it was 47,000 points, transferring from Chase right now because there's a bonus makes it even more compelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so right now, there's 30% bonus transferring from Amex to Avios, 25% from Amex to Hilton, 25% from Citi to Wyndham.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are changing all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So don't read into anything I just shared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">By the time this comes out, all of those will probably be expired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But I looked back over the last few years and every year since 2021, there's been over 50 different transfer bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And in 2025, just in the first five months, there's already been 30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So transfer bonuses are amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They typically range from 15% to 20% all the way up to 50%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Except in the case of built, they have these crazy transfer bonuses sometimes that have been as high as 100% to 200%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So transferring one built point into two or sometimes three miles in another program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But the transfer bonuses are only when you transfer the points from that transferable currency to that airline or hotel group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're not reversible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So as much as I love the fact that there are these amazing deals, I encourage people not to necessarily jump in and take advantage of them until they're ready to book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless you're really, really comfortable with that program and you know how you're going to use those points in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say that because I was really comfortable with Air France.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I transferred in some points to book a flight that we weren't sure if we were going to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We ended up not taking it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I felt really comfortable about Air France.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I felt comfortable with that deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it turns out that Air France last year, the year before, was really generous at releasing European award space in business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This year, they have not been quite as generous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have some Air France points and I don't have an easy way to use them anymore until they start, hopefully, releasing more space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So just keep in mind that those transfers are not things that you can reverse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're looking to book a trip and those transfer bonuses are happening, it can just further reduce the number of points you need to have if you're starting with transferable points in Chase, Amex, Capital One, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In addition to transfer bonuses, they're often award sales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So flying blue regularly, as much as they might not make wide open U.S. to Europe inventory as pervasive as it used to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They do have these promo rewards every month.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The next tip is to almost always book your award travel with one-way flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a couple reasons for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">One, you don't have to book roundtrip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When you book a lot of international roundtrip flights with cash, you get a much better deal than one-ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But with miles and points, there's almost never a scenario, except for maybe one or two programs that I don't use that often, where booking two one-ways is different from a roundtrip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm always booking one-ways, not just because of that, but because sometimes I don't find the availability on the other leg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we were looking to book these flights to Japan, we were trying to book them right as the schedule opened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">If I wanted to wait to book a roundtrip, I would have had to wait until the return leg opened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And by then, maybe the outbound leg was already taken and there wasn't any availability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we booked one-way trip to get to Japan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then about 10 days later, when the schedule opened for the return flight, we booked those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm booking one-ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It gives you a lot more flexibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easier to change or cancel because if you have a roundtrip, sometimes you have to call and get them to split it into two items.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can cancel one leg in case something better pops up or you want to change it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why I love one-ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I say almost all-ways because there are probably two scenarios I can think of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1787" target="_blank">00:29:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">One, there are some airlines that might charge a fee both for canceling or booking an award flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if they charge that fee based on the number of legs, then it doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But if they charge it on a booking, then it might make more sense to book a roundtrip because you'd only pay the fee once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas two one-ways, you might pay the fee twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the other one is there are some regions, and this is pretty common flying out of the UK and sometimes Europe, where if you have a trip that originates in that region, it might be more expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there might be cases where booking a roundtrip to Europe is slightly cheaper than booking two one-ways because the taxes and fees might be a little higher on the return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one where I've read it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1829"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd encourage you to go look around, but it's not one that I would think too long and hard about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, until finding

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is to look at trying to book your long haul flight, sometimes separately from the flight from your home airport or to your final destination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why doesn't always make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes I've found that the hardest flight to find award availability on is the easiest one for me to pay for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And this has happened in the past where we were trying to get from San Francisco to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And I could not find an award flight to get to Los Angeles to connect to the Los Angeles to Europe flight that was available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2025" target="_blank">00:33:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just booked Los Angeles to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we bought a paid flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, depending on the airline, if you see that San Francisco to Los Angeles flight pop up in the future, you can absolutely call the airline and see if they will add it on to your itinerary for free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe they won't, maybe they will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end of the day, a lot of these positioning flights that either get you from your home airport to that long haul international flight or from your destination on the long haul international flight to your final destination, they're very inexpensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So last year or the year before, when we were going to Europe, we wanted to go to the island of Mallorca and getting to Mallorca with points and miles would require me finding a carrier that flies from the U.S. to Europe because there are no direct flights to Mallorca.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would also have to find a carrier that flew to Mallorca.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And of all the airlines and their partners that fly to Europe, I would guess that a small number of them also have flights to Mallorca from the airport they fly to in Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So searching SFO to Mallorca was basically zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There were zero flights I could find using points and miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But searching SF to Paris and then coming home from Zurich back to SF was easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We found amazing deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out the flights from Paris and Zurich to Mallorca were like $50, $60 on Transavia and Condor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So absolutely every time I'm looking for trips, I'm trying to search from a region to a region looking for those flights that can get me across the ocean, get me 90% of the way there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's one of the things that a lot of these tools do now is you can search for West Coast airports or USA to Europe or put in six or seven different airports if you're not flexible with all of Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2129" target="_blank">00:35:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will flag one important thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are booking flights separately, they're not on the same itinerary, you are not going to be protected if the first flight is late or you miss a connection or, you know, your bags aren't going to be transferred usually over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're going to have to make sure you leave time to collect them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's just something I consider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when I think about those positioning flights, if it's a positioning flight from my home airport to the airport I'm flying internationally from, I'm probably a little more risk averse and don't want to cut it too tight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if a flight's an hour or two late and then you miss your long haul flight, that could be pretty costly mistake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas if I'm flying from San Francisco to Europe and I have this connecting flight to Spain, I want to leave enough time that I can collect my bags and go through immigration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But the worst, worst case is that I might have to miss that flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I can't get the airline to give me another one, I might have to buy another one and it might be a few hundred dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm not missing that long haul international flight, which is going to be a much harder thing to replace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So keep that in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you really want to be risk averse, you can code the night before or you can leave a really long layover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And fortunately, if you have the right credit cards, you can have lounge access and you can at least make that long layover a little more enjoyable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Next tip is to take advantage of stopovers and open jaws.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you're not familiar with open jaws, it's where you fly into one city and fly out of another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In a world where we're almost always booking one-way flights, it's not really a perk that matters because you could just book two one-way flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're in one of those scenarios where you're redeeming points and the fees or the regions make it such that it's really more advantageous to book a round trip, but you want to hit up two cities, it might be very possible to book it as an open jaw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is often allowed with programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, if you're booking one-ways, it doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, if you were flying from your home airport to city one, added a stopover and then flew to city B, then you on your own went from that second destination and bought a flight or a train or a bus to third destination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then booked an award from that third destination home, you would actually be able to visit all three destinations with two one-way flights, one with a stopover, only having to buy that one flight in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And like I said earlier, if that one flight happens to be very close together, maybe you'll get an amazing deal for under 5,000 points with a program like British Airways Obios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So taking advantage of stopovers lets you hit two places in one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do it on the outbound, you can do it on the return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Many programs have a limit of one stopover, so you're not going to be able to stop 15 different times on your trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's again where you can look and say which airlines are the best for stopovers, and you'll get a lot of answers, whether it's ChatGPT or just a search online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2291" target="_blank">00:38:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The next tactic is mixed cabin awards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2293" target="_blank">00:38:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And this has both a pro and a con.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So most of the times, there's actually no discount if part of your trip is in economy and the rest of it is in business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2303" target="_blank">00:38:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you want to make sure that you're keeping an eye on this because there are some websites where they'll say this is a mixed cabin award.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you don't look into what that mixed cabin is, so let's say you're going from San Francisco to LA to Japan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If that San Francisco to LA flight is an economy and the long haul is in business, that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That might be totally fine for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2320" target="_blank">00:38:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if the opposite is true and it says first class, but it's actually just first class to LA and then economy to Japan, that's going to be a terrible redemption of points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">However, where this can become valuable is sometimes those domestic legs are really tough to find in business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you can't find San Francisco to Tokyo in business class because you're only looking for 100% business class, you might be able to find an award where you fly in coach to a connecting city in Seattle or Los Angeles and then connect on in business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's something that's interesting and a way to book that positioning flight as part of the same award just in a different cabin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there are a few programs, I think Life Miles and Cathay Pacific are two, where they average out the award based on what percentage of the distance is in economy versus business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you were flying from, I don't know, San Francisco to New York to London, and you're okay doing the San Francisco to New York in economy, but you really wanted to do the New York to London in business class, that actually might be one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you booked through Life Miles or Cathay Pacific, you'd get a much lower price because they're going to average that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">When I talk about hidden city ticketing, I'll talk about how this could actually be something you use to your advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this next tip is one I use all the time, and it's that I try to book flights that will work, but maybe they're not ideal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I set up alerts to try to find the flights I really want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that gives me the comfort of knowing that the trip is booked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't have to wait until seven days before departure to know that we're actually going on this trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe you really want to fly business class, but you end up booking premium economy one way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you really want direct flights, but you end up booking a flight to change planes in another city because that will work, even if it's not ideal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you really want to stay till Sunday, but you decide that you book a flight coming back Saturday because you found it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We do this all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then most of these award search tools have the ability to set up alerts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">To take my previous example, we booked two flights to Japan where me and one of my daughters is on one, my wife and the other daughters on the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have 11 months until we're leaving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I went in and put alerts on both of those flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So if two seats open up on either of those flights or if four seats open up on any other flight that day, we'll be able to easily cancel or change our flights so that we're all on the same flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I remember I told my wife, you know, yeah, it's not ideal that we're on two separate flights, but if I had to put odds on it, my gut says that there's a greater than 50% chance that between now and the day of departure that we are all on the same flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And very, very often a lot of these seats open up in the final days or even hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the searches I was doing today, kind of prepping for this episode, there was amazing inventory for flights that took off in the next 24 hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be very stressful for me and my wife and the whole family if we were planning our flights and travel 24 hours out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we know, hey, we're leaving this day, we've got two separate flights, but we're leaving this day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If six hours before I can change that flight to all four of us on the same flight, that doesn't really change anything because we were already prepared to leave that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if we were booked in premium economy and one hour before departure, business class opened up, which has happened multiple times because they open up this last minute inventory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I log on, change, move to business class, amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if those kinds of changes happen last minute, it doesn't really throw us off the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes things better, totally fine with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2532" target="_blank">00:42:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things I'm always doing, I'm booking flights that could work, setting alerts for better flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if there's no flights that work at all, I'll set alerts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">If we knew we wanted to go to Japan and I couldn't find anything, I'll just set alerts for all the West Coast cities flying to Japan for at least two people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll wait until I get an email and inevitably something will open up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And we actually did that because I was thinking, why not spread our options out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously, sometimes booking multiple flights that you won't end up taking requires you to have more points and miles and have them in different programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I get that that's not something that might be easy out the gate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's certainly not something where you'd want to buy points to be able to have backup flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But the last tactic in this section is backup flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you have enough points and miles in different programs, especially now that a lot of programs have very, very flexible cancellation policies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2583" target="_blank">00:43:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I will, every now and then, when I think it might be necessary, book a backup flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We've all probably been at the airport in a scenario where a flight was canceled or significantly delayed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If you already have a backup booked and that backup can be canceled up until departure for no penalty, there's not a lot of reason not to do it as long as you don't need those points and miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2603" target="_blank">00:43:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I remember when we were coming back from Hawaii, I just booked a second flight just in case we show up and something was canceled and we wanted to get home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We had it. Turns out nothing was wrong. Canceled the flight. Got all the points back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, keep in mind, transfers to programs are irreversible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this doesn't work well if you want to make sure you keep your points as flexible as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you already have points, especially in programs like Delta, American, Alaska and United, where booking and canceling has no penalties and no fees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">then this is something I use all the time just to make sure we're backed up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I also use it for domestic flights with carriers like Southwest just to make sure there's another option if something were to go wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The next three things I want to talk about are things that kind of trip people up or can cause a lot of pain when you don't realize them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I talked about fees and program rules above, but I'm just going to focus on one specific one, and that's the fuel surcharge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at the list of fees, it's usually denoted by YQ, and I want you to make sure you're always keeping an eye out for this because not every airline charges it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2662" target="_blank">00:44:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're looking at an award flight and you see a really high fee, just like in that example earlier of the flight from Boston to Amsterdam, that doesn't mean all the partners are going to charge it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if it's an airport tax, you're probably going to pay that everywhere, but if it's a fuel surcharge, you might not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, British Airways, Lufthansa and Emirates are notorious for high fuel surcharges, and United and Air Canada are awesome in the opposite direction in that they aren't charging those extra fuel surcharges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2688" target="_blank">00:44:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the award search tools will show you these fuel surcharges, and many of them even have the ability to limit the amount of fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can say, hey, I want to search for flights from the West Coast to Europe, but don't show me anything if the fees are more than $500.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, keep in mind that high fees aren't always bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">In that example before, if your option is a $2,700 cash price, a 240,000 delta mile, or a 47,500 points plus $1,000, well, that $1,000 fee might feel like it burns, but it's way better than paying $2,700 to take that flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in that case, the flying blue option was way better, but in general, I would say just make sure you're accounting for those taxes and fees when you try to decide whether something was a good deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Another important one is when you have those taxes and fees, there are credit cards that will extend all their travel benefits if you just pay the fees on that card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Chase Sapphire Reserve is one of the best ones here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got to go look at your card's list and guide to benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But with the Chase Reserve, even if you just pay the taxes and fees on the card, all those extra travel benefits, whether it's delayed flights, lost baggage, anything like that is going to be covered just by paying those taxes and fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So make sure that you pay the taxes and fees on the right card so that you're covered for all the travel protections on that trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.440</a></span> |

around hidden city ticketing or married segment logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2839" target="_blank">00:47:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way this shows up is you might find a flight from, let's call it, Washington, D.C. to Paris and then connecting to Nice on Air France.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And Air France, Americans, Swiss Airlines are the airlines I've seen this happen most on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll find that flight available with points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But maybe you don't want to go to Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So then you just search D.C. to Paris and you can't find it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for reasons I don't always understand, airlines can kind of marry these segments together and say this flight is only available with points and miles if you take both segments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2869" target="_blank">00:47:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This also happens with cash tickets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are times where flying from Denver to San Francisco is way more expensive than flying Denver to San Francisco and then connecting to Redding, California, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a whole website called SkipLagged that makes it easy for you to search and say, hey, I'm looking for flights from city A to B.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Show me all the flights, even if they connect through B and go on to some other city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a couple of things to keep in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2893" target="_blank">00:48:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">One, if you check bags, almost always your bags are going to be checked all the way through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't want to check bags on flights like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">If you schedule a layover and that layover is overnight, or if you're on an international flight coming into the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and you left from a city that doesn't have you clear customs and immigration in the foreign country,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">then you're going to have to collect your bags and go through customs and immigration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are cases where you might be able to have your bags only be checked to the first destination and not worry about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But in general, most people say, if you're going to do this, don't check

to do this regularly, don't put your frequent flyer number on your ticket because airlines don't love when you do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If it happens one time and you get off the flight and send a message to the airline and say, something came up, I have to cancel this flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to be going on to Nice or I'm not going to be going on to Redding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think it's going to be a single problem if you just do it one time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2945" target="_blank">00:49:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think if you make a regular habit out of this, airlines will be upset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The good thing is if you're booking flights with points and miles, you're not going to earn points and miles on that flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So having your frequent flyer number attached maybe doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Most frequent flyer programs preload your profile with your frequent flyer number and don't let you change it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if you're booking your partner or, you know, your kids or your family members, they usually don't require you to attach a frequent flyer number to additional travelers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2972" target="_blank">00:49:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can always just create an additional traveler that has your name and date of birth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And instead of using I'm traveling, you say, hey, the other Chris is traveling and that Chris doesn't have a frequent flyer number attached.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that might be a little bit easier, especially in a situation where having your frequent flyer account doesn't actually add anything to the trip or scheduling a really long layover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, if you were flying to Paris and you had an overnight connection, you could probably make a case that you want to only check your bag to Paris because you're going to have to go stay at a hotel and you need your things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So definitely something to try out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can also turn this into a hack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If you remember what I described with mixed cabin awards, Avianca, Cathay Pacific, if you have some economy legs, it might be cheaper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3013" target="_blank">00:50:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine you were looking to fly from San Francisco to Japan and then you had an onward flight to India.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe with a carrier that has regional pricing, whether you fly to Japan or India is the same price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But that Japan to India leg is entirely an economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3028" target="_blank">00:50:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It might actually bring the entire cost of the ticket way down because it's only half in business and half an economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, you want to make sure that your bags aren't going to end up in India because that would be a massive challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.300</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll link to that in the show notes if you want to go deeper.</span></div><div

to this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">They probably go beyond anything I've ever even done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But for the adventurous person that wants to go down that rabbit hole, I will share that link.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, I want to talk about hotel tips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And this one's pretty quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">There aren't as many tricks and tips for hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">However, Hilton and Marriott offer fifth night free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're booking your stays in groups of five nights, you can get about 20% off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's based on usually the cheapest of the nights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3076" target="_blank">00:51:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the nights fluctuate in price, it might not always be 20%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But if they were all consistent, you'd get one of five nights free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you have an IHG card, you get the fourth night free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So 25% off, assuming they're all the same price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hyatt and Hilton also don't charge resort fees on award nights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when I went to San Diego the other week, the hotel had a $42 a night resort fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3097" target="_blank">00:51:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But because I was staying with points, they waived that fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Hyatt also waives that fee if you're a globalist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are multiple ways to get that resort fee waived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, if you have the Hyatt business card, you get 10% back on your points bookings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">After you spend $50,000 a year, you only get up to 20,000 points back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3113" target="_blank">00:51:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd say it's a small benefit relative to the cost of spending $50,000 on a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is a benefit nonetheless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3120" target="_blank">00:52:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a couple of the hotel tips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">In general, there aren't as many tricks and tips for booking awards for hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will say those Hilton free night certificates are amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Hyatt suite upgrade awards are pretty amazing because you can actually confirm at booking a suite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We've used those a few times, especially now that we have kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And that has made travel with hotels using points way more relaxing and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.180</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:52:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, two quick niche hacks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">One again on kids is that different airlines have different pricing for lap infants and children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we don't have lap infant aged kids anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">However, when we did, it was really surprising how different the pricing was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes it was so different that it was worth paying a little bit more for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the adult ticket in order to get a way better deal for the child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because the price can range wildly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, Air Canada, $25 or 2,500 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">British Airways, 10% of the mileage of the trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3176" target="_blank">00:52:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But Delta and a lot of other carriers are 10% of the adult fare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so just because you booked with points and miles doesn't mean that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">adult fare might not actually have been way more expensive, especially in the case of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">one-ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we did this one time and we were looking at Air France and the adult fare on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3194" target="_blank">00:53:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Air France was only 50,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But the adult price, if you paid cash, was like $7,000 as a one-way ticket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So the lap infant fee would have been $700.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas if we had booked that same flight on Air Canada, it would have been $25.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, Air France and Air Canada are not in the same alliance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

had way more reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu22_S4RzpU&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">lap infant
