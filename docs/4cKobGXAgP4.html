So in April of 2022, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">book I read, and we talked about this on the show was the seven story mountain by Thomas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Merton. So you remember, this is the story. It came out in 1948. It was a memoir of Thomas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Merton who had grown up with his artist father, traveling throughout Europe, ended up in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">States, ended up at Columbia, was sort of a intellectual writer, started teaching English</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">literature classes and dropped everything and became a Trappist monk at the Garden of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Gethsemane Trappist monastery in Kentucky. And the Trappists, if you don't know, are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty, pretty, um, far on the aesthetic, no, ascetic end. You know, we're going to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not out there in the community also having jobs and we're not Jesuits that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">also astronomers. It's like, no, we're chopping wood and waking up four times in the middle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of the night to say prayers. So it was about that transition. It's very influential. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">very influential because it, it, it came out during this post-war doldrums period where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">people were adrift and moving to suburbs and getting boring jobs. And so this book of reinvention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and focusing on depth and values in a radical way. And this is a clear example of my notion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the deep life in action really struck a chord. So I figured I needed to read it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so much more that's recent is informed by it, whether the author's note or not. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we talked about it before because I tried to read it on Kindle and I was like, nah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this book can't be read on Kindle. Uh, I need a hardcover. But instead of just like a normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">person buying a hardcover, I went back and bought a first edition, first printing from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">1948 of the book. I think it really mattered. I think it really helped. I think it really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">changed my experience of reading the book. Um, and it's a long one. It's 400 something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pages and in the original hardcover, which are wide pages. And they didn't mess around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with this sort of business book you buy in the airport in the 2000 and twenties, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">know, double spaced lines and giant fonts. They didn't mess around with that back in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the forties, you know, people had time. So the lines are, the lines are small. So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">took me a while to read. Um, but I'm really glad I did. I'm really glad I did. I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">more about Catholic practice now than I ever have before. So I, I recommend it. It is the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a foundational book that so many more self-transformation books, all of the big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">self-transformation books that fall in the 20th centuries were informed by seven story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">mountain and he's a good writer. All right. So speaking about writing, I then went on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to read Anne Lamott's bird by bird. I had never read that. No, I had read the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">famous writing instruction books. So bird by bird, if you don't know, is Anne Lamott's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">book about writing. It's a book about writing now, because as you might expect, I've internalized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a patriarchy. I had read Stephen King's book on writing on writing, probably because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of the, the male gendered gaze was more comfortable for me than the, the, the female gaze or what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have you. But for whatever reason, I had never read bird by bird, but it is right up there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with Stephen King's on writing as one of the two most famous nonfiction books about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">writing from the last, whatever, three or four decades. I like Anne Lamott. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I like her writing. I like her as a person, just her, excuse me, like just her approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to life. She lives and she's had an interesting, difficult life. And she, I always go deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">stalker mode on, on the houses of writers. And so she bought this cool piece of land</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in Northern California that was kind of run down and they slowly converted it over time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">into this like Oasis. I love that type of stuff. The book is good. It's focused on fiction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">writing and I'll say the main thing I came away with other than Anne Lamott is a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">writer. And the main thing I came away with is fiction writing, I think attracts more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">aspiring writers than nonfiction because on paper becoming a success seems easier. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what I mean by that is when you read bird by bird or you read Stephen King's book and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you read about novel writing, the only real activity you do is sit down at a computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and write. And so it's all about that, like just sitting down there and writing and overcoming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the psychological fears. So in theory, if you've never written anything before, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have all of the tools and things you need to potentially write a great novel. You just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have to sit down there and write. Where nonfiction, excuse me, seems more scary, right? It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like I got to get a book deal first. You don't write nonfiction before you get the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I got to go actually talk to people. I got to do interviews. So it seems harder. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the reality is when you read something like bird by bird, it's like, oh my God, fiction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is so much harder. Like, yeah, yeah, you can just get going, but man, it's just you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the screen and you have to just craft out of nowhere these characters and narratives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that reveal the human experience and do so with perfect craft because any deviation from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect craft is going to ring out. Where in nonfiction, I don't know, you just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to be competent. I have something to read about. I did research on it. If I just do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the work to do the research and I know how to write in a way that's not going to annoy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">people like you can be in the game. So I think this is the allure of National Novel Writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Month and fiction writing and bird by bird is like, maybe if I just sit there at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">keyboard of mice and men is going to come out. But I think it's way harder. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">glad I'm not a fiction writer. That just seems like it's impossible. It's like trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">be a screenwriter. Everyone's like, I bet I could do that because I know movies. I movie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">seems straightforward and it's impossible. It's impossible to actually like, right, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone can do it, but to do it well, it's like near impossible. So it's a good book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Makes me glad I'm a nonfiction writer and to all you aspiring writers out there. Nonfiction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually way, it's way easier in my opinion to like be a working writer than in fiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Then I went on and read some fiction because April had some good weather and good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">weather. I like to have fun books to read. So I went and read the Carl Sagan novel contact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">which actually I really enjoyed. So it was a premise of the book was it focused on someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">at SETI, S-E-T-I, search for extraterrestrial intelligence. And Carl Sagan works through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">what would happen if we actually did get a signal from an alien civilization. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">parts I like the best actually is he works through the science of how that would work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, okay, it would be a signal on this frequency that corresponds to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">emission frequency of hydrogen. And there would be pulses corresponding to the prime</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers because that'd be really universal. And then they're using various modulation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">screens to encode information into those, into those symbols. And so anyways, I thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that was real interesting. So I really loved the part where he got in whenever he would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">get into the science of like how alien communication would work and, and how we would track it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">down. I love those parts, but there was pretty good characters as well. I mean, it was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">good book and I love when scientists write books and they're good. The only nerd comment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to make, my apologies to the Sagan estate, actually no apologies, it's not his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">fault. It just is a demonstration of how things have changed. So the book takes place like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">in 99.

He didn't get the internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">right. So they had instead these like portable fax machines they would carry around that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">like would send messages, they would like send and receive messages through portable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">fax machines. Like he wasn't quite there on the internet, but, but you know, it was pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">close. But the, the, the small nerd detail that I noticed is the aliens used for one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of the layers of encoding in their signal phase modulation. And in, in the book Sagan's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Oh, we don't phase modulation is something that theoretically you could do, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">not something that we use really in like human devices.

Based on my understanding, phase modulation is actually now heavily used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">in wireless data protocols, like in particular in 802.11 protocols for access points, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">phase modulations at the core of it.

Then I went on and read a book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I found in a little free library at the field where my oldest son was playing little league</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">called blue latitudes.

He died a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">few years ago, like at the age of 60, just tragic, just like heart attack, just boom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">streets of DC, you know, fickle finger of fate, which was really tragic.

Talk about a writing power couple, by the way. So he married Geraldine Brooks, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">novelist.

I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">know if it was March or The Crossing.

So Jesse's going to fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">check that. Yeah. Maybe that's what it was. Originally conjectured by Henry Poincare in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">1904, the theorem conserves spaces that locally look like ordinary three-dimensional space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Was it solved? Attempts to resolve the conjecture drove much progress in the field</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of geometric topology during the 20th century. So a guy whose name started with G who solved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it? I'll keep on looking. Yeah. Anyways, the point be there was something famous solved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and the guy was this weird eccentric, I think it was Russian. And he didn't even show up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">for, I think he got to give him like a Fields Medal or something. He didn't even show up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyways, this book was sort of about a character like this. So it's a math prodigy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">who became obsessed with solving this conjecture. And basically his life fell apart because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of that. And it is from the perspective of his son who kind of uncovers this. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it's cool. It's a short book. I wouldn't say there's a lot of sophisticated plot in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like long periods of just exposition of like, let me just tell you, let me just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">summarize my uncle's story. And it kind of just tells the story, but it's really cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">because he puts in a lot of famous figures from logic and number theory and analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So Turing plays a role.

It's like all these mathematical cameos, not much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">really happens, but I love to see specialists in their fields, write fiction about their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKobGXAgP4&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">fields because I want to do that one day.
