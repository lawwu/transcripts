I think you have to be really mindful about directed attention fatigue. So if you're trying to study or you're at work and you're having a really hard time concentrating, I would recommend not just trying to power through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have the ability and the time to take a break, I recommend that you stop and you take a break. And what kind of break do I recommend you do? I recommend that you go and try to find some nature and walk in nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">What if you're having a hard time getting into a focused state at all? It's not that you fatigued it that day. You know, so many people that I hear from who listen to the podcast and elsewhere will say, you know, they get up, they did their best to get their sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They get their morning sunlight, they hydrate, they drink their caffeine, they sit down to their computer and they just can't focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they start thinking like, do they have brain fog? Do they need a nootropic? You know, all these questions start to arise. What are your thoughts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in some sense, even though you might be very well slept and very well fed, you could still be in a directed attention fatigue state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think, yeah, if you can't concentrate right in the beginning of the morning, then you should go for a walk right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">That should be the first thing you should do. Or if you don't have access to nature, maybe listen to some nature sounds or watch a nature video or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We find that all those things can be beneficial. Even looking out the window to nature can be beneficial. Looking at a picture, you've got a picture of nature here, looking at a picture of nature can be beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say anytime you're having trouble concentrating, it doesn't matter if it's at the beginning of the day or the end of the day or the middle of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I would recommend that you take some kind of break with nature and it could be simulated nature, like listening to nature sounds, watching a nature video, looking at nature pictures or even better is if you can actually get out and interact with nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because Steve Kaplan used to also talk about these other elements that might be important for a restorative environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">One was that the environment had to have extent, meaning that it had to have enough interesting things to look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it doesn't mean that it has to be Yosemite Valley, which has incredible spatial extent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's huge. It's enormous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, like near my office at the University of Chicago, we have this Japanese garden, the Garden of the Phoenix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be only like 100 square meters. It's pretty small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But, man, it's still got a lot of extent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's got a walking path. It's got a little waterfall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see Lake Michigan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one element.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing about the nature is that you want it to be compatible with your goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do I mean by that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If you've got a big exam and you haven't studied, I'm not sure going for the walk in nature is going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You better use that time to study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can't concentrate, you know, trying to power through, I don't think it's going to be compatible with your goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I think going in for the nature walk is compatible with your goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's another thing that's going to be really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other concept that Steve used to talk about being important is that the environment needs to give you the sense of being away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're kind of removed from your current environment, almost like a change of mindset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, that doesn't mean you have to go really, really far away, but you might want to go to a location that's not at your desk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe don't sit at your desk and look at the nature pictures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you want to go somewhere else and look at the nature pictures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And this kind of distance, I think, could be helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if Cal Newport talks about this in his deep work, but, you know, I've heard people talking about in an office, you might want to have like a separate area of your office for deep work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this kind of sense of being away is related to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You kind of want to get out of your current state and go into this other environment that might be able to replenish those resources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm hearing that there are two sides of the coin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">One is to designate an area for work that's truly for deep work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I followed Cal's recommendation, and now I have an area in my basement, believe it or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And there has never been a phone in that basement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There are no phones allowed in that basement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not a rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a protocol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a policy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember he talked about in his, he has this library office that he goes to, and I very much agree with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I do get internet access down there a little bit if I need to look for papers, but I've been turning off Wi-Fi on my computer when I go down there to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I get more done in three hours down there than I would in three weeks above ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I swear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a huge effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The other side of the coin is this business of getting out into a different environment, and it sounds like these walks or these ventures into nature don't take terribly long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">How long does one need to do this in order to get the enhancement and focus and working memory?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what do the data say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, when we did the, our walking study was 50 minutes, but I've seen other studies with as little as 20 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You can get the effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">For cognitive enhancement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">For cognitive enhancement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's actually been some interesting studies with kids with ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And they find attention benefits for these kids with ADHD after just a 20-minute walk in nature that actually was similar to, like, a dose of Ritalin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was pretty incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't have to be super long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we were doing the slideshow of nature pictures, that was only for about 10 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't have to be a really, really long immersion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLY8PmvIlI&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There have been other studies that have suggested, like, overall, you might want to get about two hours a week in nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
