And my answer would be reliability. If somehow it ends up being the case that you really want them to be reliable and they ended up not being reliable, or if reliability turned out to be harder than we expect, I really don't think that will be the case, but if I had to pick one, if I had to pick one and you tell me like, hey, like why didn't things work out?</p><p>It would be reliability, that you still have to look over the answers and double check everything. That's just really puts a damper on the economic failure that can be produced by those systems. - And they'll be technologically mature. It's just a question of whether they'll be reliable enough. - Yeah, in some sense, not reliable means not technologically mature,</p></div></div></body></html>
