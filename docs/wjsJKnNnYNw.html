A tight novel, quick moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I like the structure of Michael Crichton's The Terminal Man. It's a very quick moving, takes place in near real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's over like two days. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Limited set of characters, limited set of locations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But bring in an Andy Weir style blackboard sci-fi where you really get into like how would that actually happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like this is it was running, you know, we're at this type of deep learning neural net and we're in the Google cluster and the scale got to this and like really working through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think there would be a public interest aspect to this, a way of bringing people into the world of AI technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And don't hold punches like this is complicated technology, but let's get into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that'd be such a cool book. And I think it'd be fun to write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have no time to write something like that, but it's part of my aspiration that my life should be, my life should get to a point where I could write something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's a scheduling dream of mine. I have too much going on right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How would I know that I have the right mix that I could write a book like that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I should bring Andy on to talk about that. Like how does he write? How does he work it through? What's his process?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He has a cool story, by the way. I don't know if you know it, but he was working for NASA when he wrote The Martian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was not even self-publishing. He was posting chapters on the web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it was just going to a website. Like, let me work through what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was also another great example of slow productivity in action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was just working through chapter by chapter at a completely slow, because it's just him, completely slow pace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just he thought this was fun. The main character's name is Mark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what's the challenge Mark is facing next and how would he work it out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was just publishing these things on a website and people loved it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at some point a publisher said we should put this into a book. We should sell it as a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what classic slow productivity, right? It wasn't this stressful. I'm on a book deadline. I have to get this thing done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was just working on this thing, crafting it. And that's what made it work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He could take his time and work out the math and it wasn't stressful and it became a huge seller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to get Andy on. I want to talk about that. And I want to talk about how do you write a book like that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I just have to figure out how to take like 17 out of 26 things that I'm currently committed to do off my schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that should free up, I think like a tight 15 minutes a week I could work on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which means by the time the book comes out, we would already be enslaved by artificial intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'd be relevant. Gotta have relevance to what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. In terms of fiction recommendations, don't come to me to fiction recommendations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a terrible fiction reader. I grew up with genre books, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I began reading at a very early age, adult fiction and the books my mom would get me from the library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">She's like, I don't know what books to get an eight year old. So she would just get me genre fiction books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I have a weird, nostalgic childhood affection for genre nonfiction fiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I read so much nonfiction for my work that I don't have, I use fiction reading as a escape or relaxation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's all embarrassing. All of my suggestions are embarrassing because it's all just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's genre fiction writers for which I have some sort of childhood connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I enjoy, you know, getting some crackers and reading it on the couch or something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like for example, at the moment, I'm reading Wilbur Smith's very first book that he wrote in the 1960s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Smith died a few weeks ago. He was a British or maybe African writer of, I don't even know what you call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's genre, it's adventure. He writes a couple different topics, but sort of like adventure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not thriller, but more like adventure books, epics, and it's none of it's good literature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's all of its time and incredibly anachronistic. But I grew up on these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he'd write books like, he wrote one, I think called Gold Mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It would just be about a gold mine in Africa. And there'd be some protagonist and antagonist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and there'd be some drama. And he wrote a book, I think it was called something like Hungry as the Sea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was about a salvage boat captain, you know, and like they're trying to salvage a boat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then bad guys get involved and try to hold them hostage. I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's usually some adventure in it or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was like, oh, let me go back and read his very first book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called When the Lions Feed, and it's an epic of some, this family, the Courtney's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's in South Africa, I think. And it's set in the 1800s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, again, it's of its time and very anachronistic, but not great literature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsJKnNnYNw&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I love first books.
