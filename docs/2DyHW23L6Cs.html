here in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a second there is a QR code here

save the big questions to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">end but basically we'll be popping back and forth between the slides and then between hands-on work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">inside of a notebook so if you do get stuck with anything raise your hand we'll come over and try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">help you through and try to stick to our schedule as well with around 10 to 15 minutes per each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">section and there's about five sections for us to walk through so before we start there's two things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to do if you haven't done them already the first thing is we want to create a blank Neo4j graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">data science sandbox this is going to be at sandbox.neo4j.com so basically what you're going to do if I go ahead and click this link</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you might have to create an account really quickly on this page and then you're going to click for data science here and then it's going to be this if you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this blank graph data science thing here so you're going to click on that blank sandbox graph data science</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and then your that will create an instance for you and it should come up with username and password that you're going to use inside of the notebook so this will be the database that we'll use throughout the course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the next thing that you're going to do is go to the notebook so the notebook is going to be in this link and also by the way this QR code so I'll go back to that in just a second if you missed it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but before that I just want to show you this GitHub repository and it's gen AI workshop is the notebook so what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to go to this notebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you're going to want to click open in Colab this will require a Google account if you don't have a Google account you can use VS code or you can run it locally that's fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">but then when you go in if you are using Google Colab the internet is a little bit slow so it might take a while for it to load here hopefully once everyone gets settled it will go a little bit faster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but basically what will happen is you just want to go to the top menu and you're basically going to go like file and you're going to save a copy and drive just so that you have the ability to edit it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">so you go file and then you say save a copy and drive and then it will create another copy for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'm going to go back to the slide and I'll give everyone a little while to get that all set up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">actually too while we're waiting on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">15 people can still sit in the front if you don't want to stand in the back so feel free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">yes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it might be a good idea for you to start running the notebook cells so especially the first cell the pip install</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">just because that might take a little while if when you just start that might it's probably the longest running cell in the whole notebook is just loading all the requirements for today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so to say again create your sandbox blank sandbox at blank sandbox gds graph data science and then you're going to open that notebook create a copy of it or have it locally and then start running that pip install cell right here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so what happens i did the blank sandbox instead of the blank data science sandbox</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">i did the blank sandbox instead of the blank data science sandbox</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that one will maybe work but what i'd recommend doing is just terminating that instance so if you go to the um if you go to the screen once it's there just uh press terminate there's like a garbage can icon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and then go and create a graph uh data science sandbox yeah blank it's blank sandbox dash graph data science is the one we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">so the main difference is actually that the graph data science sandbox has a little bit more of memory so as we're doing some more involved operations it's just faster to complete so the regular blank one should still work but it will take longer so the graph data science one will just be faster so it runs with a little bit more memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah i know it's we need to work on that it's a little bit tricky</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">alrighty so um i'll leave this here is there can i get a show of hands of how many people have the notebook set up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so we're pretty good um is there is there anyone who still needs to stay on this pr code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">okay we'll go ahead and move on um so i'm gonna do like my general spiel that i normally do i think for a lot of us this is gonna be review um we're gonna be talking a lot about retrieval augmented generation today um and for those who are you know unfamiliar right retrieval augmented generation is just when you have this step in the middle when you're communicating with a large language model where instead of sort of like in a chat gpt like way where you're just sending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a question and getting a response back you're going to have that LLM application go and pull relevant data through some query</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">um that it can then use to reduce hallucinations provide more domain specific context enable better traceability etc</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and when we talk about graph powered retrieval augmented generation and we'll use the word graph rag kind of throughout this course is we're talking about the combination of three things that we're gonna look at today so that's gonna be vector search which i'm sure a lot of you are already fairly familiar with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge graph traversals which is going to be traversing over structured data in addition to the vector search and then we're gonna do some cool things with graph data science so we're actually gonna create a new type of embedding a graph embedding and we're gonna use that that vector to do some very interesting things for recommendations with structured data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">um and today so um everyone does chat bots which chat bots are wonderful i wanted to do something a little bit different today um so we're actually going to do an example of using a large language model to construct an email um sort of like a recommendation recommendation type of email um and this is going to be for clothing so imagine um someone's looking for something like a halter neck top right how do you choose what to buy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">why well you need a list of things that are available in your online store you need to match that specifically for that specific customer right which different customers might have different preferences um and then you might want to have other recommendations to pair with that item like maybe a pair of pants um or a hat or other accessories and things of that nature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and so what we're going to do is sort of build an AI fashion assistance so to speak to help scale this um so we're going to use real world data from a Kaggle competition from H&M um and we're going to do some search and retrieval we're going to add some context for personalization a small recommendation engine and we're going to wrap that into sort of an LLM chain inside of LANG chain to show you how to generate that response um and the idea behind this right is again we're combining sort of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we're combining sort of this knowledge graph which provides this context and this enrichment with the large language model giving that reasoning and that creativity and sort of the we're giving some liberty to the large language model to kind of take what's in the knowledge graph based on the customer's purchase behavior and other textual data and vectors um and and kind of say use your creativity to put something together for this customer basically um and while we're doing sort of a fashion recommendation thing here this same process could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">could work for different types of support agents um or a lot of different types of internal search and customer experience use cases um and this is what we're going to build today um um what's that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to be sharing the deck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">deck is in the github repo i need to it's not the most it's not exactly the one that i have here but i'll update it tonight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">pdf pdf the pdf of the workshop slides is in the repo yep yep yep um so this is what we're going to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">today it's a little gradio app um where basically we're going to enter in some customer information their id</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a time of year um and some of the things they're interested in and we're going to generate an email that provides</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">various recommendations to that customer so imagine you're trying to create targeted marketing content or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever it may be this is sort of an example of how to do that and these are the specific technologies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll be using um so we're going to use open ai for the language model we could of course substitute that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">out um with vertex ai or gemini or whatever we wanted to there we have lane chain that we're using to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">orchestrate everything so that's going to be creating the vector stores and also the large language model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">chain we're using colab obviously and then gradio just to kind of show you an example of a very simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">ui that you can put on top of that just for demonstration purposes and this is going to be how we're splitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the course up um so basically there's this journey that we're going to follow we're going to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">with building our graph

that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">better personalize the

basically what this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">graph is telling us

you can have a certain style of jeans but they can be you know have different color patterns different sizes etc</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">so the product is sort of like the product and then the article is like the variant of that product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">we also have each

for example the customer id to uniquely identify a customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=784"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that takes some messy data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and it puts it into a compact format</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

co-purchase relationships in a graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.240</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:27:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that can become very valuable for then using downstream</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">in vector search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1669" target="_blank">00:27:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">yes yep we will walk through that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so similarity for something like a text embedding is referring to semantic similarity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so the meaning behind a text sequence for a graph embedding right similarity can mean similar in position</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or structure inside of a graph and that can have semantic meaning too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and right now what we'll be using vector search for is just on text embeddings and later when we get to recommendations is when we're going to use graph embeddings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and specifically node embeddings that we're going to use there inside of vector search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so talking a little bit about just what's inside of neo4j so neo4j has multiple indices and you can use these in combination with each other so we have things like range indices which is just a general kind of index that can do range comparisons and equality comparisons on numbers and dates and things like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">point indices which are geospatial or I guess point space indices right text indices and full text indices so we have a full text index that's backed by Lucene for example that is tokenization analyzers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and today what we're going to be focusing on primarily are vector indices and our vector index uses HNSW hierarchical navigable small world yes there we go for approximate nearest neighbor search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of this might be review for the folks in this room right but the idea behind this is that if we have some product some text about a product and let's say a search prompt on the right here for a halter neck top we can start to identify things that might be more similar to that using that embedding vector right and sort of the semantic similarity inside of that space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And right and right and right and that semantic similarity can be measured by either in Euclidean distance right or cosine distance and like I said before we're using HNSW to perform approximate nearest neighbor search or we will be here in just a second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to start you know let me just go ahead and jump into the notebooks I think it'll be easier to do live so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: I have a question before we're going to ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for those who are not familiar with Neo4j, how to visualize a node for me. We have created something that's not clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, so right when we're done with the vector indexing I will go into browser which is one of our tools for visualization and we can take a look at that but basically if you go into this page here I can go to open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: Open and then it will take me basically into the browser tool. This is going to take a while because of the internet lag and we can visualize in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're willing to bear with me in creating a vector index first because I want to just go over that very quickly and then we can go into the visualization portion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: But yes, we will very soon be visualizing the data. What I wanted to do first though was just kind of get it, get our index set up and just show you how to do some searching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: So basically what we're going to do with our data. We're specifically going to match the product nodes. So if you remember we have that product node which is a variant of an article and the way that this is going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: You can call embedding models externally too but what we're going to do here is basically match the product where it has a detailed description.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: So basically some of these products don't have complete information so we're just going to take the ones that have complete information and then all this thing is doing is it's using this code gen.ai vector encode batch to on the server side create embeddings and then set that embedding property on a property called text embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: We're using OpenAI for this. There's a few other models that we can use here or a few other API providers rather. By default this is using text embedding ADA or ADA but you could also use Vertex.ai here as well as Azure OpenAI or AWS Bedrock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: And then you can also just generate your own embeddings externally and ingest them for any other type of model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: So if you go ahead and give this a run it will start creating your embeddings and then the cell after that is going to create your vector index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: So this isn't creating an index all this is doing is basically populating in batch a text embedding property and then after you create that this cell down here if you run that is going to create your vector index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: We're going to set it ahead of time to use cosine as a similarity function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: And then you're just this next call is just to wait for it to come online since once you set it it just takes a little bit of while for it to index all the data and become available for querying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: Can you just clarify the difference between generating the embedding, which is the semantic of the text, right? Versus creating the vector index and what's that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: Right, so when you're doing the embedding generation, all you're doing is you're taking this text field that I talked about earlier, you're sending it to OpenAI to say, hey embed this, you take that back and then you set that as a property.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: So all this cell is doing is basically making these vector array properties inside of the node and then the vector index actually sets the index to make that searchable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: Once you've gotten that done, we can do a couple examples of search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: And again, this is sort of just using Cypher here and you can do this externally as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: But in this cell, I'm taking a search prompt that is very simple, just denim jeans, and then I'm passing it to this function, which is running Cypher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Male Speaker 2: All this is doing actually is just encoding, so basically it's just creating the query vector, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I were to just encode denim jeans, this is the query vector that that creates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2074"

fully understand your question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">When you create, you basically instantiate an index for one or a set of properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That can be on a node or it can be on a relationship, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I make one index to cover, you know, the property of text, that's one index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I could create another index to

you said you're using Lucy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2654" target="_blank">00:44:14.380</a></span> | <span

automatically auto-sharding it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what are you doing to make sure --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There are, there are ways to federate the database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you could, you could create different shards based off of metadata values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're, that's stuff that we're, like, currently building on and experimenting with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And for very, very large, like, if you, if you truly had, like, tens of billions of documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you can also integrate with your vector store of choice, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then just basically you substitute out the vector retrieval call with, for that vector database</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you can use Neo4j for doing a lot of the graph traversals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's one of those things where we're continually improving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're coming out with new features to handle that sort of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's start with semantic search with graph patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is going to be, basically, building on top of vector search where we start to work with structured data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when we think about Neo4j and semantic search, there's sort of multiple layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2736" target="_blank">00:45:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the first part is vector similarity search, which we just went over, which is just finding relevant documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">After that, there's graph pattern matching, which is basically saying, hey, can I find entities associated to these documents?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2749" target="_blank">00:45:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And the sort of patterns in that connective data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have the more data science and machine learning part on top of it, where we can improve search relevance and do other things by running graph algorithms like embeddings, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when we think about semantic search patterns with graph, there's connections that we have based on purchase behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, given that you have one person who purchases relatively the same things as another person in this graph, you can start to make inferences about what they might want to purchase next, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is sort of like if you've ever dealt with collaborative filtering or sort of those types of patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a very common recommendation pattern that we can do with structured data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2790" target="_blank">00:46:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we go back to the graph, we'll start exploring the data set now in a little bit more detail with visualizations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what I want you to do, and I don't have these calls saved, but I'll go ahead and copy them over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, you're going to go back to your browsing window, and you're going to open your blank instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm going to click open, and hopefully, that'll work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And if not, I might actually start hot spotting myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2831" target="_blank">00:47:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2836"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll get this pretty graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a sample of the data that we loaded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So customers are in orange, articles are in blue, and products are in

right, is we have these customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.380</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:50:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Make that a little bit bigger so you can see when I go to purchase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">it should have a transaction date, a price, all that sort of stuff.</span></div><div

here's my article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And my article is a variant of a product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we've done so far is if you go down here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we've created, right, this text field for every product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what the text description looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we've created this text embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is our OpenAI embedding that we have here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we zoom out, the graph structure that I was talking about before in slides,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we start to see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you start to see that you have these customers that are co-purchasing things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">right, at different times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can start leveraging that graph structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can use that graph structure to start informing our search and our LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">how to return better responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, what I'm going to do is I'm going to feed it a specific customer ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So all this does is it basically caches this parameter for this specific customer ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can use that in later query calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to go ahead and put that in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I am going to take this query here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically what this query is just going to do is tell me the history of this specific customer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">their purchase history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to go back here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to say, hey, get me the customer with that ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then get me all the things that they purchased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then all of the product categories that those were in basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3096" target="_blank">00:51:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And just return some metadata about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to go ahead and give that a run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will tell me this person purchased the specific product names right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The product type that they belong to, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And the description of those products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3110" target="_blank">00:51:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the cool part about graph is I can basically start taking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I can pull the latest purchase history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I can start making recommendations off of that latest purchase history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3123" target="_blank">00:52:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's lots of more complicated and fancy ways to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But the basic idea here, right, is that if I go with this, I can pull the latest purchases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So similar to what we did before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Just say, hey, take this customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Get everything they purchased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Get sort of the max date as the latest purchases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm going to do this long query here.</span></div><div

is say, hey, take this customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Take their latest purchases, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at other customers that purchased the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then look at what they purchased, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what it's saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like, right, if ABK, if I buy the same things as ABK does, I can say, right, which, okay, thumbs up, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, and then I can basically say, well, for me, look at what ABK has purchased</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and a few other people that have similar purchasing behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3174" target="_blank">00:52:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And is there anything there that I haven't bought yet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That's basically what this query is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you run this query, what you'll see is you'll start to get these different sweaters and everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And this will change for every customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea here is that this structured data that can feed us this, you see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you have these common purchase scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is basically scoring the amount of times that you had common purchases between customers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and then like sort of the next thing that they buy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, eight other, there's been eight other common purchases between people that have bought this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and between something that this particular customer has bought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3213" target="_blank">00:53:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these top, go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You can imagine this as your peer group, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So the people that are like you, that buy the same stuff or interested in the same stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's your peer group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3224" target="_blank">00:53:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You just look what else has your peer group bought that you haven't bought yet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3228" target="_blank">00:53:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of what is behind that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are the top ring things in the peer group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So this specific sweater, this T-shirt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Say slowly again what the common purchase score means in plain language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me look at it again just to make sure I have it right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're basically counting the number of paths between the number of co-purchase paths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically this customer, when we go out and look at what other people have bought in that peer group basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">how many times has that item been bought in that peer group?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3268" target="_blank">00:54:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so it's the score attached to an item.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.380</a></span> | <span

means lots of people have bought it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.380</a></span> | <span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3279" target="_blank">00:54:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">How does it, sorry, how does it know it's a peer group?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Peer group being that it's sort of the local graph structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm doing right is I'm basically, if I look at this graph, I'm basically going like I'm starting at a specific customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I'm looking at the article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm looking at everyone that bought this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm going out one more hop, right, to see everything they bought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm going to count up how many times those purchases appear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3311" target="_blank">00:55:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more purchases there are, the more likely it is, right, that that individual customer is likely to like that product just based on the common purchase behaviors in the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3321" target="_blank">00:55:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case then, the customer that you were just pointing out, the, well, yeah, before you scrolled away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just, I want to make sure I understand the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you picked that one random customer and you said you go one hop away from, so yeah, so assuming that person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Then that blue product, I guess, so that's the one they bought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the one to your left, I suppose, that would, or I guess right, whatever, the next, the closest blue dot, that's another product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div

goodness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There's lots of products, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's basically going bought this, this person bought that, and then for all of, see, and there's a lot of interconnected relationships too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it, and then yes, for all of that, and then go out one more purchase relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're basically going out and then you're saying, okay, how many times do these other blue nodes show up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3383" target="_blank">00:56:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more that they show up inside of that graph, the more shared purchasing behavior you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's basically just counting that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3393" target="_blank">00:56:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You could write the query to go out further if you wanted to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You could.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You could build it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and part of the machine learning piece does that automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I ask a question about time window?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, here you are considering like, you know, the person, no matter if it's one month or one year, that's one transaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3417" target="_blank">00:56:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Versus if I'm considering window, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">One month versus one year versus one way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a way like, you know, to make this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3425" target="_blank">00:57:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3426" target="_blank">00:57:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you notice, let me get out of this view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3430" target="_blank">00:57:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If I go up to the query that I just made here and maybe I went through this a little bit too fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But you should see in here I'm saying, I'm just going on max date.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3442" target="_blank">00:57:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could filter the date to say like TDAT, which is the purchase date variable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You could say, do that for only the last week or only the last two weeks or whatever filter was relevant for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's basically the idea that we're going to use to provide additional, we're actually going to do a graph post filtering pattern with vector search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're going to do is if you, if you come back to the notebook and you go down and run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, here's the query, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3477" target="_blank">00:57:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what we're doing is we're going to instantiate another vector store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Except here what we're going to do is we're going to say, we're going to put a retrieval query at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this is going to do is it's going to do vector search like before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3492" target="_blank">00:58:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But then after it does the vector search, it's going to try to match for that customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to create that sort of peer group, that local graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it's going to score, well, how many times does that product show up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So this matches maybe almost backwards, making it probably a little bit hard to read, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's the same query that we have before where we take the customer ID and then we go sort of one or I guess two hops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But really we're saying, okay, get me that peer group where we go to the article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We look at all the purchases, the common purchases between customers and then we compute that same score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3528" target="_blank">00:58:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's some multiplication here that I do basically to combine the vector search score with the, what we're calling the purchase or the co-purchase score here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically what this does is it now allows me to pass a customer ID into the search result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when I do similarity search with that, it will start sorting things by basically this purchase score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So now instead of getting, because denim jeans is like this really generic thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So different customers, and we'll see when we run the app later, if you plug in different customer IDs, this result is going to be different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3567" target="_blank">00:59:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's personalized now to this customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically with vector search, we're now using this post-filtering pattern in the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can also do a pre-filtering pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3576" target="_blank">00:59:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're using a filtering pattern, right, to now rescore these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So now, okay, we're just returning, for example, these different denim items, which are much more relevant for this specific customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you explain the difference between search score and purchase score?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3598" target="_blank">00:59:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me see what I did here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So search score is basically just the vector score that came back from the cosine similarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're doing similarity between two vectors, right, for the text description, that's going to be your search score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Purchase score is going to be what we were showing before, which is showing the popularity inside of the peer group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm just multiplying them together to create a combined score here, but there's different ways that you can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So are you going to use this product as a way of ranking those results?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3630" target="_blank">01:00:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look down here, these results are now ranked differently, and it's actually different from the query we ran before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3636" target="_blank">01:00:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So we ran the same search prompt with denim jeans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But here you can see we get like Rachel HW denim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We get Jade HW damn skinny and all this sort of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3646" target="_blank">01:00:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at what we ran before, if I were to scroll up to the top here, this one, you'll see that these are different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">These are actually different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">These are different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3666" target="_blank">01:01:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a different ordering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some similarities here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like this is number three where it was number one below.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea is that you're sort of re-ranking this right now that you're personalizing it to this specific customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And this gets really powerful as you get more and more structured co-purchasing data, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3684" target="_blank">01:01:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3685" target="_blank">01:01:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are there a bunch of purchase scores zeroes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there's going to be, if you, it's an optional match.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3692" target="_blank">01:01:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you notice, the sort of literal reason is that this is an optional match.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But the other reason too is that there could be a situation where they're searching for something that isn't bought in their peer group yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3708" target="_blank">01:01:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is just organized so that even if you didn't catch anything in the graph structure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3713" target="_blank">01:01:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you would still have a way to return results based on the vector scoring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3719" target="_blank">01:01:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will, and it will try to see if there are, if anyone else has bought anything of that nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3743" target="_blank">01:02:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3744" target="_blank">01:02:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they have, then it will, it will help reorder the ranking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could do it the other way around too where basically, and we have another app and I might take it to our booth where you could do the graph traversal first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3763" target="_blank">01:02:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3764" target="_blank">01:02:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So like if you, if you had a scale problem that was, you know, very large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3768" target="_blank">01:02:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the, one of the ways we can scale is through basically, hey, I would do the graph search first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3773" target="_blank">01:02:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after that, I can do the, the vector search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3776" target="_blank">01:02:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, whatever you are getting in this, how is that different from like, like, the recommendations for products that you may have to say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a separate system competing with batch recommendations for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, people can't hear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3808" target="_blank">01:03:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question, the question was, why can't you use like an external batch recommendation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you potentially could.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3817" target="_blank">01:03:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What you're getting here is basically as this data is updated in real time in a transactional store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3822" target="_blank">01:03:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to be able to re-query it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're getting everything kind of in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3828" target="_blank">01:03:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're doing rag and you want answers to be, you know, adjusted for what people had just purchased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3834" target="_blank">01:03:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3835" target="_blank">01:03:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This would be a way to accomplish that inside of a graph database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3838" target="_blank">01:03:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a lot of flexibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3840" target="_blank">01:04:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You can change the way this query is, you know, you can shorten the time period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3844" target="_blank">01:04:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You could create a different type of traversal to go more than one hop out, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

way to get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=3866" target="_blank">01:04:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But is there a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4172" target="_blank">01:09:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we're going to start augmenting semantic search for knowledge graph inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4182" target="_blank">01:09:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So this will get a little bit into what you were talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4185" target="_blank">01:09:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot more, so I didn't like, we have a whole knowledge graph builder where we build relationships from unstructured data that we're not doing in this course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4194" target="_blank">01:09:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But we do have it at our booth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4198" target="_blank">01:09:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, this is where we're going to start using the graph data science portion of Neo4j.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4207" target="_blank">01:10:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we have this thing called graph data science inside of our product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4214" target="_blank">01:10:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, what it does is it offers various graph algorithms to you and this special workspace and data representation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4221" target="_blank">01:10:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can effectively create a projection of part of your graph in sort of this sparse matrix representation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that allows you to run a lot of algorithms very efficiently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4231" target="_blank">01:10:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So things like path finding, centrality, community detection, different machine learning algorithms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4237" target="_blank">01:10:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and of course embeddings and K&N similarity, which is what we're going to talk about here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4243" target="_blank">01:10:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">With a lot of focus on this graph embedding piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4247" target="_blank">01:10:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a customer who created a very nice sort of periodic table of all of our algorithms for reference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4255" target="_blank">01:10:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of different areas, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4257" target="_blank">01:10:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of things that we aren't going to get to talk about here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4260" target="_blank">01:11:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So things like community detection, path finding, centrality, topological link prediction, and directed acyclical graph algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4270" target="_blank">01:11:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But we are going to talk about similarity in embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4273" target="_blank">01:11:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, a node embedding works just like any other embedding except it's for a graph where the things you're embedding are nodes in a graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a picture of a very small graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4288" target="_blank">01:11:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's Zach's Karate Club is the name of the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4291" target="_blank">01:11:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's basically the relationships between different people in a karate club.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4295" target="_blank">01:11:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea is that I can take this graph and I can turn it into a set of vectors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4301" target="_blank">01:11:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, it's a 2D vector, which is a 2D representation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to create longer vectors for the notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4307" target="_blank">01:11:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea here, right, is that the yellow nodes that are similar in the graph in the sense that they're really close in the graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4315" target="_blank">01:11:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to be really close in the embedding space and the orange nodes and the green nodes and the blue nodes, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4320" target="_blank">01:12:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the idea of what we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4322" target="_blank">01:12:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We're basically embedding what we call homophily, which is basically this fancy term for like the locality inside of the graph structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4329" target="_blank">01:12:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And once we do that embedding, what we're going to be able to do is start inferring relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4335" target="_blank">01:12:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So someone mentioned being able to do sort of inference beforehand so calculations are available at query time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4343" target="_blank">01:12:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to use k-nearest-neighbor for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically this is happening outside of an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4350" target="_blank">01:12:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What we're going to be doing is creating graph embeddings, specifically on the articles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4356" target="_blank">01:12:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to be inferring these k-nearest neighbors between them based on k and n, which is this semi-supervised or unsupervised algorithm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4364" target="_blank">01:12:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can do this for a lot of different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4366" target="_blank">01:12:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We are going to use co-purchase relationships for this and kind of scale that process for multiple hops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4372" target="_blank">01:12:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could do this for other forms of link prediction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4375" target="_blank">01:12:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, things like entity resolution or if you're trying to resolve, you know, maybe you have people and locations in the same graph and you're trying to resolve whether or not a person is in a specific location.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4386" target="_blank">01:13:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use these sorts of models to start making those knowledge graph analytics and drawing those relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4396" target="_blank">01:13:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's dive into the notebook to see how that works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4399" target="_blank">01:13:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4400" target="_blank">01:13:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4401" target="_blank">01:13:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned you're embedding the nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4402" target="_blank">01:13:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we essentially throwing away the edges?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4405" target="_blank">01:13:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not embedding the edges?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4407" target="_blank">01:13:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're doing a node embedding which is specifically focused on nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4414" target="_blank">01:13:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We could do different types of knowledge graph embeddings which embed like the edge and like, right, it embeds the, what is it, the head and the edge to the tail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4423" target="_blank">01:13:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4424" target="_blank">01:13:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are those types of embeddings and there's different types of subgraph embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4428" target="_blank">01:13:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">For today, we are, the relationships are used to understand where nodes fit inside of that vector space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4434" target="_blank">01:13:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4435" target="_blank">01:13:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">In terms of clustering of, in this case, what's going to be co-purchase behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4439" target="_blank">01:13:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're not throwing them away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4440" target="_blank">01:14:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They're going to be used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4441" target="_blank">01:14:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But we, and we'll use the, yeah, you'll see as we go along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4446" target="_blank">01:14:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll continue to use the relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4448" target="_blank">01:14:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Sounds good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, what we're going to do here is we're going to create a customers also like relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4457" target="_blank">01:14:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, this cell, so it's going to be the first cell after you get to augmented semantic search with knowledge graph and ML.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4465" target="_blank">01:14:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you run that cell, it's going to run our GDS algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have some utilities to kind of help clear, clean things up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4475" target="_blank">01:14:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then basically, we're going to create something called a graph projection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4480" target="_blank">01:14:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't have a whole ton of time to go into detail on these in a two-hour course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4485" target="_blank">01:14:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But the basic idea, right, is that I'm going to look for these common co-purchase relationships between articles and customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4493" target="_blank">01:14:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm going to project that as a co-purchase relationship to an in-memory graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4500" target="_blank">01:15:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm creating basically this graph that contains articles and then a weighted co-purchase relationship between them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4506" target="_blank">01:15:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">After that, I'm going to run our node embedding model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4512" target="_blank">01:15:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have supervised models that we can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4516" target="_blank">01:15:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But in this case, I'm going to use something called fast RP, which stands for fast random projection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4521" target="_blank">01:15:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, what this is is a graph embedding that is going to use a lot of sort of this matrix multiplication with sort of this sparse random matrix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4533" target="_blank">01:15:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So the math behind it basically allows it to calculate an embedding really quickly without necessarily needing a neural network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4540" target="_blank">01:15:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to make these embeddings 128 dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4543" target="_blank">01:15:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to specify certain things like an iteration weight that will tell me how many hops to go out when looking for other similar nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4551" target="_blank">01:15:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once I create that embedding, I'm going to write GDS KNN write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4558" target="_blank">01:15:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what this is going to do is it's going to find nodes with similar embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4563" target="_blank">01:16:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to write a customer also likes relationship between those nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4568" target="_blank">01:16:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's some sampling procedures that I can use inside of KNN to make it run faster, which I'm doing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4575" target="_blank">01:16:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once I have that, I can write both my embeddings back to the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4580" target="_blank">01:16:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And in KNN, I just wrote the relationships back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4583" target="_blank">01:16:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we have these customer also like relationships between articles inside of the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4589" target="_blank">01:16:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I get some stats when that's run telling me about whether or not it converged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4594" target="_blank">01:16:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The number of new relationships written, which is going to be generally a lot because it's doing this quadratic comparison.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And each relationship is scored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4604" target="_blank">01:16:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a similarity cutoff at I think 75 and this was using cosine similarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4609" target="_blank">01:16:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it would be negative one to one, I think, that it was using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4615" target="_blank">01:16:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can visualize node embeddings as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4619" target="_blank">01:16:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's interesting to do in the sense that it will tell me clusters of purchase behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4625" target="_blank">01:17:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So these cells that I have here, I've commented out because they take a while to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, this should still be able to be rendered here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4635" target="_blank">01:17:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This visual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4638" target="_blank">01:17:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, what this visual will show you is you see we get these clusters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4641" target="_blank">01:17:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, what I did is I took those 128 dimensional embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4644" target="_blank">01:17:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I used a TISNI, which is just a way to condense that down to a smaller space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4649" target="_blank">01:17:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I condensed it down to a 2D space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4651" target="_blank">01:17:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, what you'll see is you'll get these clusters of commonly purchased things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4656" target="_blank">01:17:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this is sort of doing the multi-hop thing that you were referring to earlier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4662" target="_blank">01:17:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">where now it's starting to look at, okay, well, these different clusters, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4666" target="_blank">01:17:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">These clusters represent items that are often co-purchased together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4670" target="_blank">01:17:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Baskets, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Baskets, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4672" target="_blank">01:17:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, baskets in a sort of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4675" target="_blank">01:17:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now, it's just co-purchasing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4677" target="_blank">01:17:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could organize into orders inside of the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4679" target="_blank">01:17:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could do co-purchasing baskets as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4681" target="_blank">01:18:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, with that information, we can start to sort of scale how we power just plain recommendation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4690" target="_blank">01:18:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I can create a new query here, where basically, instead of going to the vector database,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4696" target="_blank">01:18:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I can just say, okay, we'll match the customers, get me everything they purchase, the articles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4701" target="_blank">01:18:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">get me what else customers also like to buy, and get me the product behind that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4706" target="_blank">01:18:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's similar to what we did before, except it's scaling it to sort of a, to a multi-hop pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4713" target="_blank">01:18:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can substitute other machine learning models in here if you wanted to, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4718" target="_blank">01:18:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If you had, for example, a supervised model that you wanted to use for recommendation, that could be substituted in here to make these inferences,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4725" target="_blank">01:18:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you all of a sudden have these customer also purchase relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4728" target="_blank">01:18:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You could also create a vector index for that graph embedding, which we're not doing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4733" target="_blank">01:18:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We've sort of done the KNN beforehand, right, and we've written the relationships to the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4738" target="_blank">01:18:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that allows me to do this customer also liked relationship that I can draw in the query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4743" target="_blank">01:19:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that gives me a set of recommendations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4746" target="_blank">01:19:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, not necessarily based off of a search pattern, but just based off of what the customer had purchased before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4753" target="_blank">01:19:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And to your point earlier, we could create time, date, and date cutoffs, and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4757" target="_blank">01:19:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is basically just a way to kind of scale things with the machine learning model and leverage graph embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4766" target="_blank">01:19:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that was it for the graph embedding and sort of the graph machine learning section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4772" target="_blank">01:19:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, you can use a lot of different types of machine learning models here to basically infer these relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4780" target="_blank">01:19:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">some of which exists, like, inside of our platform through graph data science and others that you can bring in externally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4785" target="_blank">01:19:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We're at 4:48, so we have, what, 45 minutes left, a little under.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4792" target="_blank">01:19:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we haven't taken a break yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4795" target="_blank">01:19:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm wondering if we should power through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4798" target="_blank">01:19:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4800" target="_blank">01:20:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">How do people keep going?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4802" target="_blank">01:20:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, keep power through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4804" target="_blank">01:20:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4805" target="_blank">01:20:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4808" target="_blank">01:20:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you always have to recalculate it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4812" target="_blank">01:20:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there, like, any communication going with customers coming in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4815" target="_blank">01:20:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, right now, you do, yes, have to recalculate the graph embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4821" target="_blank">01:20:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Ideally, right, if you, like, over time, if customers have been in there for a while, that graph embedding, like, well, it'll slow down how much it changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4830" target="_blank">01:20:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We are working on things for the future that might make that easier in terms of getting things in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4837" target="_blank">01:20:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But right now, for calculating graph embeddings, it is something where you have to recalculate it for the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4842" target="_blank">01:20:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Thankfully, though, with something like FastRP, that'll work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4846" target="_blank">01:20:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we've, I've seen it work on graphs with billions of nodes and relationships, and it can calculate in, like, half an hour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4854" target="_blank">01:20:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But yes, right now, you do have to recalculate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4857" target="_blank">01:20:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You could use other methods, too, like, averaging the neighborhood as well, for sort of, like, intermediate embeddings as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4871" target="_blank">01:21:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you didn't want to recalculate it right away, you could take, like, the average of the neighborhood and use that as, like, a stand-in embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=4884" target="_blank">01:21:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What's that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Here's the prompt itself. So this is just the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5594" target="_blank">01:33:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt we look at in the slide before.

So it's basically, right, using a combination of this vector search to pull</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5718" target="_blank">01:35:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">things back, personalizing it so that it becomes specific to just this user, and then adding additional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5725" target="_blank">01:35:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">recommendations to that as well. And of course you can change the prompt to be just the recommendations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5730" target="_blank">01:35:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">portion if you wanted to or just the search portion or, you know, whatever, whatever was appropriate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5735" target="_blank">01:35:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for the application at hand. And if we just looked at, so basically this cell, if I run it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5743" target="_blank">01:35:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all this next cell will do is show you the prompt, the full prompt that was set to the language model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5751" target="_blank">01:35:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we look at this, this is basically showing you, if I were to scroll all the way to the top,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5755" target="_blank">01:35:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it provides quite a few products. You can see here this is the data that it retrieved and formatted from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5761" target="_blank">01:36:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the database for the relevant products, all the different garments that it selected. And then if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5767" target="_blank">01:36:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I were to go down more, it would eventually bring me down to the recommendation products, which I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5773" target="_blank">01:36:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it already did here. So if I go up further, yes, relevant products. And then it should give me about 10 of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5782" target="_blank">01:36:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">those. And then other recommendations from the graph embeddings that go along with that going down here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5788" target="_blank">01:36:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it basically chose from those products to generate that given response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5794" target="_blank">01:36:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Yeah. If you look at the way those queries were written in the cells before, I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5809" target="_blank">01:36:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">first one for the search responses, I limited them to 10. And then for the recommendations, I'm actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5814" target="_blank">01:36:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">passing 100. So I'm passing quite a few. But yeah, eventually, if you provide enough of them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5820" target="_blank">01:37:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you will hit a context window issue. And then, so basically, once we have that, we can run a demo app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5828" target="_blank">01:37:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, we're using Gradio. This is just some examples, preset examples for that we can use in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5836" target="_blank">01:37:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">application. And this is running the application. So I'll go ahead and give it a run. And if you have it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5843" target="_blank">01:37:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">your notebook, it should just give you a link that you can go to. And basically, let me make this bigger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5850" target="_blank">01:37:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's seeable. So here's just a UI of what we had before, right? So this is the example that we ran</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5856" target="_blank">01:37:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier. So if I say submit for this specific user, it should pull back hopefully in the next 20 seconds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5864" target="_blank">01:37:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">or so because the internet is slow. Normally, it's around 10 to 15 seconds. Yep. And this will pull</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5871" target="_blank">01:37:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">back the email response. And the interesting thing about this is if I took, you see this customer ID</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5877" target="_blank">01:37:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is like D-A-A-E. If I select a different customer ID, but the same prompt, so say it's this person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5886" target="_blank">01:38:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I click that and then, yes, this change to this other customer. This answer should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5892" target="_blank">01:38:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be different. And if it isn't different, it's because they have a very similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5896" target="_blank">01:38:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">peer group and a very similar piece in the graph. But if you see HW denim and skinny jeans, and then this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5904" target="_blank">01:38:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see they get a bunch of different recommendations and search patterns. So the idea here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5910" target="_blank">01:38:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">right, is even though these two individuals had the same interest based on their purchase behavior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5916" target="_blank">01:38:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the graph, we're able to give them very different recommendations because they exist in very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5921" target="_blank">01:38:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">different parts of the graph and have different interests based on their purchase history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5924" target="_blank">01:38:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can play around with this. Like if I, you'll see it'll give me some summer things here. If I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5930" target="_blank">01:38:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">change this to like February, right, this is nothing to do with graph. This is purely an LLM thing at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5938" target="_blank">01:38:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">point and I submit it. It should, the email should change to winter and then it should give you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5943" target="_blank">01:39:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of summer must-haves, it should give you something about winter and it should be able to select</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5949" target="_blank">01:39:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">different products down here that should hopefully, if the LLM is doing its job correctly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5956" target="_blank">01:39:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">go for more winter related items like sweaters that you see here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5959" target="_blank">01:39:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the, that's the full app that kind of leverages all the things that we just went over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5967" target="_blank">01:39:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Thank you so much, everyone. This was really great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5971" target="_blank">01:39:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5973" target="_blank">01:39:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DyHW23L6Cs&t=5976" target="_blank">01:39:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.</span></div></div></body></html>
