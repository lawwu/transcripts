I think most people would agree that one hiccup, sort of funny, two hiccups in a row is really funny. And three hiccups in a row is where it starts to be concerning in part because hiccups can be kind of painful. There is a technique that can reliably eliminate hiccups. And it's a technique that takes advantage of hyper-contracting the phrenic nerve over a short period of time so that it then subsequently relaxes or alleviates the spasming of the phrenic nerve. And that simple method is to inhale three times in a row. This is a very unusual pattern of breathing, but what it involves is taking a big, deep inhale through your nose. Then before you exhale any air, take a second inhale through the nose, however brief that inhale might be. And then a third, even micro or millisecond long, inhale through your nose to get that third inhale and then hold your breath for about 15 to 20 seconds and then slowly exhale.</p></div></div></body></html>
