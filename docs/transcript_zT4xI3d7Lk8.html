You know, Kobe said his dude was the hardest player he ever had to guard. I had the pleasure of playing for this dude in Nathan Hale. He taught me a lot, he's been a big bro to me since.</p><p>So I appreciate you being on the show, my brother. - Oh yeah, no doubt, thanks for having me on the show. - You already know. So we're gonna start out in the NBA, just 'cause that's obviously where most people know you from. And I grew up watching you, idolizing you.</p><p>So we're gonna start up there, then we'll kind of move to some other stuff. Man, so yeah, I wanna, first off, I just wanna ask you about your favorite players. Who was your, like your time, who was the best players that you played against in your area? - Yeah, so my area meaning?</p><p>- Like your era, your era. - Yeah, well, I guess I'll start with first, you have the names that are like LeBron James, you know what I mean? Him are a class apart, so. - So already back then, he was like-- - Well, I never played against him, but hearing about him and just hearing the legend of LeBron James, it's like, okay, is he that good?</p><p>So when I first seen him, I went, damn, he is the best player. You know what I mean? It's not that you say, oh, I'm gonna concede to this guy, but watching him, he was that good at an early age, and I think that kids kind of get that misunderstood.</p><p>And I think I told you, I'm like, you're one of the best players I've seen since a LeBron. That doesn't come around often with size, handle it, shoot it at a young age. So he was off top, the best kid when we were in high school, and then another guy that was big was Carmelo Anthony.</p><p>He's the next dude you always hear about. And again, like I said-- - So you was the same age as those guys. - Well, yeah, we're the same age, but we're a class of, me and Carmelo are a class of 2002, and Bron is 2003. - Oh, okay, okay, okay.</p><p>- So I think Melo might be 37, I'm 37, Bron's 36. So yeah, so we're all in that same, I would say, era of guys. And Melo, and then CP3, them dudes are all that good. - Right there. - Ramy Feldman, those are, again, so when I get a list of my era, I always try to go with, okay, those are the dudes that's in the league, you know who they are, they've been good pretty much their entire life.</p><p>But then, locally, I've always had really good battles with, you found out coming to Seattle, Rainier Beach High School's a big high school, so I had battles with Logic Stewart, Roderick Stewart, twin brothers, Nate Robinson went there. So we battled, another cat that went to Franklin High School, Anthony Grant, he's really good.</p><p>Then you got, my brother was always the hardest player I'd rather play against. - Your brother? - Yeah, my older brother. - He would beat you one-on-one? - Yup, yup. - That's just the older brother thing, though. - Yeah, you know, you play, I see you and Tay play, it's kinda like the big brother has that slight mental edge.</p><p>So, those are all dudes that I always looked up to, admired playing against, competing against, and again, to this day, they're the ones that push me to always wanna keep getting better, 'cause you're always hearing about them, and seeing what they're doing. And then it's like, all right, I wanna try to make sure I stay on that level.</p><p>- Right, so then, you didn't mention Kobe, so he was obviously a little older, but how much older was he than you? And I was gonna ask you, what is your favorite Kobe story? - Yeah, so with Kobe, now that's, you know, I always start with Michael Jordan as my favorite sports figure, greatest athlete ever.</p><p>But what was really cool about Kobe was, he eventually became my second, because when I got introduced to basketball, it was like, Jordan, you know, he's at the top. But when Kobe came into the league in '96, I'm like, okay, damn, he plays like Jordan, but he young. - Yeah.</p><p>- And he kinda cool, and more fitting, you know, the age group and the popularity of how we wanna do things. - Right. - He had the little baby fro, and you know, I'm getting to high school, I got the baby fro now, you know, so it was like, Jordan was the guy I idolized, and then it moved into Kobe.</p><p>But it was cool, because I always try to play like Jordan, you know, footwork, pump fakes, fade away, and Kobe was doing it too. So now I'm going into it like, damn, so now my second favorite player plays just like my favorite player, but he's younger, and I can relate to him more, you know, it's like, you know, you watch the shows like Moesha growing up, and then Kobe go to, you know, you see him and Brandy going to prom, and it's like, damn, this is all my, this is all the stuff I'm into.</p><p>When Jordan was, you know, he was older and more mature and doing different things, so that was real, that was real dope, and then, yeah, ever since then, he's just always been the guy that I idolize watching and playing basketball. So, you know, I would say my favorite Kobe story was when I was in Portland, and we had a win streak against the Lakers in the Rose Garden.</p><p>So, you know, I got hurt, and leading up into this game, Kobe sprains his ankle, you know. I mean, I wouldn't say it then, but I used to watch Laker games, you know, it's just as much as, you know, playing, it's like, all right, now I gotta, I record my DVR of my Laker games, 'cause, you know, Kobe was still my favorite player, but I didn't want anybody to think that he had an edge on me because I did like him so much as a player.</p><p>So, you know, we're getting ready for the game, and, you know, they asked me, am I gonna play, and I was just like, nah, it's just not ready yet. I think it's my hamstring, and, you know, Kobe was like, gonna play if I was gonna, if I was gonna suit up, he was gonna play, and I was like, no way, he hurt his ankle too bad.</p><p>- So, like, if you was gonna play, he was gonna play? - He was gonna play, yes. - How did you know that? - Yeah, so, we'll get to it. So, you know, long story short, they ended up scratching Kobe, and they're like, all right, he's not gonna play.</p><p>You know, they do that stuff on ESPN, and then our little pack is like, we don't know if he's gonna play or not. So, we're gonna prepare as if he is and go over the Kobe sets and how they're gonna play. So, I was like, nah, I'm still about a week away.</p><p>So, I put it out there early, and then, you know, he's obviously in the other locker room. You know, we know he's in the arena. Every camera follows him in. So, I'm in the training, doing all my stuff, and then I go back to the locker room, and I had a friend of mine, Chuck, he works with Nike, and then he worked with Kobe.</p><p>I was like, is Kobe gonna play? He was like, if you play, he's playing. I'm like, I'm not playing. You know what I'm saying? He was like, all right. He said, nah, I don't think he's gonna play. So, I was like, all right, cool. I said, ask Kobe when the team's about to warm up.</p><p>Can I come down and say what's up? He was like, all right. So, long story short, Chuck didn't come back in the first quarter. So, he came back in the second quarter, and he was like, Kobe said, yeah, come down there, but wait 'til the teams go out and come after halftime.</p><p>So, I was like, for real? So, I'm getting all nervous. Like, I played against him, but we never talked during the game. You know, he'd just be going at me. So, I was like, for real? He was like, yeah. He was like, he said come down, but let the teams go out.</p><p>So, I'm like, all right. So, the teams, you know, Nate come in and give his speech. Both teams go out, and I'm walking up to the locker room. I'm like, damn, so what I'm gonna say to Kobe? So, I'm all nervous, and I walk all the way down the hallway, and then I get to the door, and I'm kind of listening in, and I like tap to knock on the locker room door, and the trainer was like, who is it?</p><p>And I peek in my head, and I was like, oh, it's B-Roy, and Kobe was laying on the table. Like, he was fully dressed. He had his whole warm-ups on, everything. He was laying on the table getting stretched, and the dude was like doing something to his ankle. But, so I'm like, oh, man, it's like Kobe.</p><p>So, he hops up off the table, and he's like, B-Roy, come here. And I went to dap him, and he like gave me like a bear hug, and I was just like, this is Kobe. And then I like loosened up, and he's like, how you doing, man? So, I ended up sitting down.</p><p>Like I said, he's laying on the table. I sit like in the little locker, and we ended up sitting there talking, and you know, joking the whole second half of the game. - For real? - And that was, you know, for me, you know, not just because of his passing, but that was like, damn, I'm meeting, you know, my idol, and I get to hang out with him.</p><p>You know, and talking. Man, I asked him everything under the sun. You know, I was like, so how's your and Michael Jordan's relationship? He's like, me and Mike's cool. I'm like, oh, yeah, that's cool, you see. But, you know, most people, you know, I always try to look at it like I'm in the NBA, but I'm still a fan of it.</p><p>- Right. - So, you know, I asked stuff that I think my dad would. You know, we wanted to, you know, know like, how does Kobe tie his shoes? You know, all that stuff was cool. And then I even joked, I was like, so you really was gonna play?</p><p>He was like, yeah, if you was gonna play. I was like, damn, you are dressed. - How old was you at this time? - Man, I was my, that was my third, that was my third year in the league. So, I made the All-Star game my second year. - Right.</p><p>- And it was in New Orleans, but Kobe didn't play 'cause he had like a bad thumb. And we really didn't talk much. Like, I was in awe then of him. You know, I mean, we had a few different things where we all did it together as a team.</p><p>But, you know, I remember like getting on a bus and it's like, damn, it's Tim Duncan. You know, you're in the West. It's like, they're going mellow. It's like all these great players. Iverson's on the team. Shrimp did the next, Shaq's on the team. So, it's like all these dudes are idolized.</p><p>But then it was like, okay, where's Kobe? I'm all sitting on the bus, patiently waiting. Where's Kobe getting on the bus? So, then Kobe comes and cameras follow. He get on the bus. I'm like, yeah, that's Kobe. So, no, it was cool, but we didn't really have a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>- Right. - Of course, I was playing well in New Orleans and he was like, man, stop being nice, man. Stop being passive. Like, you can go be MVP. I'm like, MVP of the All-Star game? Yeah, right. And he was telling me to do it. And I was like, man, all right, we'll see.</p><p>But that was kind of like the most of our interactions at that point. So, then that next year, like I said, when he didn't play, that's when I was able to sit down and have, you know, a real long conversation with him. - So, even all the way back then, like dudes in the league, it was, there was a lot of really good players, but Kobe was respected on a whole 'nother level than like-- - Yeah, you know, and it's hard to explain.</p><p>Like, they're all really respected. You know, I was just as happy to sit down and, you know, have conversations with Tim Duncan. You know, I had watched him, you know, he was in college. This was way before you guys was, you know, probably even born. But, you know, I watched those dudes 'cause we got to build relationships with our favorite players from the college level.</p><p>And that's how we got to know 'em. Where you guys are, you guys get idolized a little younger, more like high school. Like, I didn't know nothin' about Tim Duncan in high school. So, we see Chris Webber and them dudes, like we learn 'em from Michigan and the Fab Five.</p><p>You know, and Tim Duncan and those dudes. So, that's how we got our celebrity. That's how they got their celebrity, but that's how we got to know those guys. So, it was big, but yeah, there was somethin' about Kobe comin' around. You know, it was somethin' about him where I seen how like, okay, like, you know, this is LeBron, this is Mello, but they're all the same age as me.</p><p>And we all looked up to the same dude. Even though they're great, and you know, LeBron's MVP and a champion, and Mello's one of the top players in the world, we're all still like, when we was kids, lovin' this dude the same way, just in different areas. And you can sense that, I think, with bein' around a lot of young dudes.</p><p>You know, 'cause Chris Bosch, all those guys. You know, it's all class 2002, three, one. And Kobe was like that first dude to really just be, you know, he was cold, but he was also, you know, he was that next level of like, all right, he goes to private school, but he's gonna go outta high school, you know.</p><p>That whole kinda, you know, he got game type thing. Like, yeah, he's really doin' it. And he's, you know, all-star, he's rookie, second year, everybody's votin' him. So, he was just really that guy that I think a lot of guys my age just really, you know, we loved him.</p><p>- Even your age, but my age too. I mean, that's one thing that I like, really wish coulda happened. Like, I never got to even meet Kobe. I remember I was at the Nike Basketball Academy. And Kobe-- - You never got to meet him, huh? - He flew in on a private jet.</p><p>And I left that morning before he flew in on the jet. So, all my homies got like, you know, Trey, Gary Trent. All those guys got the picture with Kobe. I never even got to meet him. So, I love asking stories about him, 'cause that was just like, it was your idol.</p><p>Like, even younger dudes, like, he spanned across generations, like his, like. So, even for me, I was like one of my favorite players, so. - Nah, it was, you'da liked meetin' him too, because, you know, I was always worried, 'cause on the court, he was like, you know, he'd go after it.</p><p>- Right. - So, you know, I'll tell you somethin' that's funny. Like, when I was comin' in the draft, I think the Lakers was pickin' like 20th, 21st. And I knew I was gonna be a top 10 pick. And I told my agent, I'm like, man, I think I'm gonna go to the Lakers.</p><p>You know, I'm gonna play with Kobe. And he's like laughin', like, nah, I'm like, I'm serious. Like, you know, is there anything we could do? He was like, I mean, I'll call him. You wanna work out? And I was like, yeah, I'll work out for the Lakers. So, I ended up workin' out for the Lakers my very first workout.</p><p>- For real, 'cause you wanted to play with Kobe. - Yeah. - And y'all was the same position. - Yep, so check it out. So, we do the workout, Phil comes in there, and he sits on his little Bosio ball, and he's, you know, he's watchin' the workout. Craig Hodges ends up workin' me out.</p><p>I was juiced, I'm like, Craig Hodges from the Bulls? So, you know, I was like, man, this is crazy, just bein' in here. So, we end up workin' out, and, you know, I'd worked out really well. I worked out, I think, with Aaron Oflalo, and we ended up goin' up to the back, and I met with, you know, Mitch Kupchak and Phil, and they were like, all right, so let's just get to it.</p><p>Like, why are you workin' out for the Lakers? And I was like, man, I think me and Kobe can play together. You know, and at that time, that's when the Lakers had, you know, lost Shaq, and then the Heat, so I was like, man, I gotta get my guy, Kobe, back on top.</p><p>(laughing) - Man, that's crazy. - And I never even, I hadn't met him yet at that point, but I went to all the Laker games at that playoff series. I was there, and he made the shot against Phoenix. - For real. - And, you know, I was, yeah, my agent's like, man, you know you gotta play 'em next year, right?</p><p>So you can't be, you can't be sittin' here. - Yeah. - You know, yellin' and screamin'. I wore my Kobe jersey. I was like, I'm gonna play 'em if I have to. I might be a Laker, you don't know. You know, it hurt a lot to hear that he had passed, because he meant a lot, you know, just to me, and just basketball, period.</p><p>- Man, I remember when that happened, I was sittin' in the locker room. We was about to play a game, they canceled it, and I couldn't believe it. - Yeah. - So, like, when you, when that quote came out, where Kobe, they interview him, and they was like, who's the best player, you gotta guard, and they said, like, Brandon Roy.</p><p>Do you remember when that was, and like, what year? Do you remember what year that was for you? - Yeah, that would've been my third year. That would've been my third year. I think we was playin' Houston in the playoffs. And I'm like, I was happy, 'cause I was like, yeah, Kobe said that, but also, I'm like, man, you puttin' a bullseye on my back, with Ron Artest, so.</p><p>- But Ron Artest said it too, though. - Yeah, but, you know, I didn't take it, like, in a bad way, I took it like, that's big time. And, you know, Portland's in a smaller market, so when somebody like Kobe said that, you kinda gotta look up, like, is Brandon Roy really that good?</p><p>Like, why are these dudes sayin' that about him? And I took it like, I'ma make sure I try to live up to that. - Right. - But it is a situation where, you know, I'm not a big, you know, media guy, to where I do a lot of media stuff, and a lot of promotions.</p><p>So, you know, I remember goin' back east, and, you know, the media was like, well, you know, New York fans don't really know who you are, and, you know, but a lot of players speak highly of you. And I was like, that's fine with me, because I'm not really goin' after the, long as when I step between the lines, a guy respects me, or, you know, approves of me, then that's all that really matters.</p><p>But, yeah, no, that was, you know, that was like the icing on the cake, you know, for Kobe. It's not often that, I don't care in what profession that, you know, you're in, that, you know, the guy you idol that is at the highest level in the sport, gives you, you know, that kind of a compliment.</p><p>So, I definitely knew what he meant by it, you know, because, you know, when we talk, you know, he's just like, man, you know, you have counters, you know, you can tell, you adjust. If a guy tried to take this away, you'll do somethin' else. And Ron Artest pretty much said the same thing.</p><p>So, I just took it as like, you know, validation to a lot of my hard work, to always tryin' to go in the gym and get better. Because, you know how it is in this game, man. Dudes are smart, there's a lot of smart players, there's a lot of smart coaches, and they're watchin' you goin', how can we take somethin' from him?</p><p>And I've always tried to keep addin' and addin'. As long as my body physically would let me, I thought that, you know, I could, you know, just keep improving, because, you know. So, that was, that was cool, man. I mean, I don't even wanna, it was better than cool, because, you know, I don't think people would really understand how much that meant to me, for him to say that, and to publicly say it.</p><p>Like, you know, like, who's the hardest player? I was like, wow, you know, and then Ron Artest is awesome, 'cause those are both good defenders. - Exactly. - Like, you know, I've had my struggles with Ron. You know, dude's a, he's strong, he's physical, and a lot of times, I try to use my weight, or my size, to get guys.</p><p>And I had to learn with Ron, I was like, man, I gotta try to out-quick him, 'cause he's too strong to be tryin' to go up against all day long. I'd be tired, and then he had really quick hands. Like, Ron had really, really quick hands, so I had to protect the ball, try to attack his feet a little more.</p><p>So, all that stuff is just me bein' a fan of it, and just tryin' to, just really win the dang game. You know, it's like, you know, you work so hard, you're like, man, I wanna get over the hump, get over the hump, and in order to get over the hump, you gotta be somebody pretty good, or go after somebody pretty good.</p><p>- You ain't lyin'. Shoot, like you said, you kept adding and adding, and kept getting better year after year, and that's, like, you took that compliment as a testament to your hard work. I wanted to ask you, like, I remember you, you talked to me about this one time, but your game day routine, like, so, like, we gonna talk about the lifestyle stuff off the court, what you like to do, but on the court, what was your, like, motto?</p><p>Did you, like, was it the same thing every day, and kinda, like, walk me through what a game day would be like for you? - Yeah, so, college is different, you know, 'cause college is always a little more team-oriented, but professionally, my game day usually always went with, like, I would wake up, but I wouldn't eat before I left the house, I would go to shoot-around first, and then I usually try to eat right after shoot-around.</p><p>So, wake up, shoot-around, depending on what's ache, you know, aches and pains, it would depend on how early I would go before. And also, depending on how deep into the season, if I wanted to lift, I would always try to lift, usually a little closer to game time, 'cause I wanted to feel a little stronger going into it.</p><p>So, my mornings was really chill, and I would almost even tell my body, like, I'm gonna be relaxed until about four o'clock, 'til kinda getting up and getting my shower in. So, we'll do shoot-around, then I would eat, then when I go home, you know, I have my son, I think my, end of my rookie year, so I would always try to play with him on home games in between.</p><p>And then it's like, all right, now I'm gonna take my nap. I might have played one or two basketball games ever from high school on without taking my nap. - For real? - And it throws me off in the worst way. It's like, if I don't get my nap and my shower, I just do not feel like the same person.</p><p>I feel like I'm exhausted. It's like, damn, I feel so tired out here. And it's like, man. So, I would always do my nap, I get a pre-game nap. Then for my pre-game nap, I wake up, and then I put on whatever music I got. If I'm on the road, I put my thing on the little speaker, play music.</p><p>If I'm at home, I got my music ready, blast it, shower, start getting into my groove, getting my body going. And then early in my career, I would drive to the games. Later, I didn't wanna drive. I was just like, nah, I wanna just sit in the car and ride 'cause traffic picked up in Portland a lot.</p><p>So, I was like, man, I'm gonna be in the car for an hour. Nah, I'm bumping cuts, changing songs. You know what I mean? Last minute tickets here or there, talking to mom and dad last few minutes. And then I get to the arena, I would try to go in and get shots early before the court fill up.</p><p>You know, you got the times where certain dudes come in. And shit, I'd go out to the court. And we talked about it. I just tell you the biggest thing is listening to your body. If I felt really tired, I would just tell whichever coach I was working out with that year or that time, like, I'm a little tired, but I wanna work on this.</p><p>I feel like last night, I didn't feel good shooting my pull-up. Or, you know, this team loads up a lot. So, I know they're gonna double the markets. I might get some open threes. So, you know, let's get some touch on that. And then I try to work on a sweat.</p><p>You know, I'll go good for about, I might be out there for 30 minutes, but 15, 10 to 15 minutes, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna work up a lot just to get a feel. I wanna get a feel for the arena, the ball, you know, all that stuff. You know, I don't know about you, but all that stuff seems to matter to me.</p><p>It's like, damn, what ball we playing with tonight? Like, 'cause some of 'em are bad and then some of 'em are, like, damn, that feels plush. So, for me, it was like, all right, once I got that feeling, I was going back to the locker room and shit, I was kicking my feet up.</p><p>- For real? - Yep, I kicked my feet up going to training room, messing around with Jay Jensen, all the guys in there, rank joke. I play better the looser I am. - Yeah, and I'm the same way. - Yeah, you know, I kinda like to take my mind off of it.</p><p>Me and Nate had had that conversation. You know, he was like, the locker room kinda follows your mood. You know, he's like, I'm the type of dude, I'm serious. So, when Nate come in, Nate's like real, he's the coolest dude, he just looks serious all the time. So, he was like, but you, you know, I hear you talking and, you know, kinda goofing off.</p><p>Conversation ain't got nothing to do with the game. We might watch another game, being on the West Coast. We get all the East Coast games to be on. And then I'll just kick back and, you know, clown around again until I tell my mind, all right, around, you know, 20 minutes before tip, Nate'll probably do a speech.</p><p>And then that's when I'll start to tap back into, all right, this is what we gotta do. So, again, it was always a shower. It was always a nap. And then, as far as how I worked out, which is depending on how my body felt, you know, if I felt like I had a lot of energy, I would go harder because I play better when I'm a little tired, you know?</p><p>Yeah, people would always ask like, why you play good in the fourth quarter? I'm like, 'cause finally it seemed like my body settled down. Or like towards the end of the second quarter, you know, we had games where I didn't even wanna shoot early 'cause I felt a little too jacked up.</p><p>So, I swing it, you know, try to come out and get some stops, play defense. Coach Monte was the one to tell me I had went through a struggle early my rookie year and I was already playing well. And then I just went on like a dive. I just couldn't seem to mentally figure it out.</p><p>So, we first started at the free throw line. He was like, you know, you never look at the free throw. He said, you always dribble, dribble, but you never look at the rim. He said, start looking at the rim more. I was like, all right. So, I started picking his brain more and more about other little stuff, you know, inside of the game.</p><p>And he's the one that really helped me, you know, kinda evolve, not just being a player, but mentally thinking like, hey, go ahead. It's okay to think about it or visualize it before you actually, you know, go out there and do it. So, that was really cool to have him there to give me a lot of those small pointers.</p><p>- That's dope. And then off the court, you've always been a real chill dude. I mean, you know, I've been around you a lot, be around Dell a lot, telling me stories. How was your, some dudes get in the league and they like to wild out, go out all the time, spend money.</p><p>Dell, say, you just be chilling. Like, what was your, how did you like to, you know, be off the court during those years? - Yeah, so I would say it's balance. Some of it is like, I have my son in my rookie year. So, I never really just had that time to say, okay, life about me right now.</p><p>'Cause it's like, once he came, I'm like, all right, I gotta focus on that. But I also set the bar high for myself with basketball. So now I'm going, man, I wanna come back and get that kind of attention and praise more next year. You know, being rookie of the year was like great, but now it's like, so that kept me focused.</p><p>It kept me grounded. And, you know, like most people, I think it's always good to have your fun. But for me, it was always, you know, I was gonna put my family first and I was gonna put Portland first. It was like, you know, this is gonna take away from me, you know, taking us up this hill.</p><p>Then I ain't gonna do it. So I was really focused in that way. And for the first time, I would say in my life, I was starting to get some attention. You know, I've always got it flown under the radar. People go, he's good. I like him a lot, but nobody really knew me.</p><p>So it was like cool to kind of start getting that attention and then I didn't wanna let it go. So off the court, you know, I've always been big on like going to movies, doing family stuff. I mean, I like my fun time too. You know, I just try to be private with it.</p><p>And I think, you know, people can do what they want. But for me, I like to be a little more private just because it's not really everybody's business. But yeah, I like to have fun too. You know, I just do it in a private form. But other than that, man, I'm like, I'm chill, dude.</p><p>I think I was watching one of your episodes. You said you could just go away for a year and just get off everything. And I'm like, man, I can really do that. Hard part for it now is you'll see is your kids got stuff going. - Yeah. - You know, it's like, I'm like, if I go run away and disappear, I'll be happy.</p><p>But it's like, damn, I gotta go back to first day of school. Oh damn, my kid got a game, you know? So it really becomes impossible to do it. So you gotta learn how to do it in spurts. - Yeah. - And that's how I learned how to do it.</p><p>It's just always taking my time and, you know, never feeling rushed for it. So, and then when it's stuff I gotta do for the kids, you know, I gotta, of course, always just be a father for them. But I'm chill, man. I could disappear. I'm fine with nobody, you know, mentioning me.</p><p>I'm the same way as you, bro. - Yeah, not wrong with it. - Man, one time we talked about, I want to bring this up, Greg Oden. Because I seen a video on Instagram and it was just a video of him. I don't know if you've seen him walking around and like a lady, an old lady just asked him, "Did you used to play basketball?" And it was like, he said, "I used to." And he was just like, you could just see how sad he was.</p><p>- Yeah, I've seen that. - But me and you have talked about Greg Oden and how good and dominant he actually was. Like even in the practices with you, he was obviously one of the best players. So talk about that dude for a little bit. - Yeah, man, Greg, no, I'm glad you even asked me about him.</p><p>Like you said, I always speak about him, but, you know, never with much of an audience. So that's cool of you to even think about him. But, you know, you were a reason why I did think of him because, you know, when I got to the Blazers, Greg came in a year after I did.</p><p>And man, I remember I was the, I had just won Rookie of the Year, and I think it was Kevin Pitcher was like, "Man, you want to do the draft lottery?" And I was like, "No." 'Cause he knows I don't like to fly and travel, especially, you know, my off season.</p><p>He's like, "Nah, I ain't asking this time. "You gotta do it, come on, B. "You gotta be our good luck charm." And I'm like, "Man, all right, but I'm gonna fly there, "and I'm gonna fly right back." He's like, "All right, done." So I ended up going out there.</p><p>And we knew who it was. It was like, if you're number one or two, you're gonna take Durant or Oden. So, but we were gonna be like seven. So I was thinking like, "All right, whatever." Man, and I get there, and we ended up getting the number one pick.</p><p>And I was like, "Oh, man, I am the good luck charm." So I joke around, and to this day, I still got the jersey that they gave that day where Blazer was number one pick. I don't know if they know that, but I kept that. So I was going through some stuff the other day, and I had seen it.</p><p>But, you know, we get the number one pick, and people are asking all these questions. But before I went on, our media person was like, "Don't tell anybody "who we're picking or if we're leaning." I'm like, "Yes." I give the whole, you know, what you call it, public answer or whatever they call it.</p><p>So I ended up getting back to Portland, and I'm thinking like, "Well, who are we gonna take?" 'Cause now everybody's texting, you know? It ain't social media. Everybody's like, "Well, who are you guys gonna take, "Kevin Durant or Greg Oden?" And, you know, everything that I'm gonna say about Greg Oden is not taking anything away from Kevin Durant.</p><p>Kevin Durant is, you know, again, he's on that level of guys where, you know, my favorites are, you know, Jordan, Kobe, Kevin Durant. He's in that conversation. So, but Greg Oden, man, when I seen him, and you gotta remember, this is a different NBA now. You know, you still post up.</p><p>You know, you still play with the big. So, long story short, we end up drafting Greg, and we're having like, you know, these workouts. And we're doing like football stuff, and we're out in the field. Man, we was doing 100 yard down and backs, and, you know, Greg and LaMarcus are like, they're winning, and these dudes are the tallest players on the team.</p><p>Like, he could run. Like, he could run. And then, when we got in the open gym, whoever's team Greg was on was gonna win, 'cause you know how it is. Like, man, we're all good, but it comes down to those, like, you know, couple plays here and there, and Greg could defend better than just about anybody, and then he can get offensive rebounds.</p><p>He kept every ball alive. So, I was like, man. And I remember calling my dad. He was like, you know, how good is he? I was like, oh, we could win a championship. Like, for the first time in my life, playing with him, I was like, we could win a championship.</p><p>He was that good. And I'm not saying we could win, like, that year, but having him on the team, we had everything we needed to win a championship, because he filled a lot of those holes. And I was like, man, he was that good. I mean, once he got comfortable in games, I was telling Nate, I'm like, I don't know.</p><p>I'm kind of bored, 'cause Greg does so much. Even defensively, you know, I'm guarding dudes, and, you know, our help defense don't have to really help, 'cause he helps everything. So, I started, like, learning, like, okay, so I'm gonna leak out. I started getting more transition stuff, 'cause I'm like, Greg's gonna get the board.</p><p>And offensively, he gets tips. He just tips. It doesn't matter. He's pushing dudes, just tipping the ball, keeping plays alive. We got second chance points. And I was like, man, he made the game so damn easy. And, I mean, LaMarcus had to figure out how to play with them, because, you know, even when he get post touches, man, they're doubling, so we're more open, and we're not used to being open.</p><p>We're used to, like, having to, you know, carry the load to win games, and now we're winning games more comfortably. So, no, he was a special player, and I mean, I hate when people try to say stuff, you know, a bust, you know. He was injured, but if he was never injured, there's no way in hell he was a bust.</p><p>I mean, he had a Hall of Fame talent. I mean, that kid was, he was good. He could shoot free throws with his left hand. He shoot 'em with his right. He had everything, and I just wish the world would've got a chance to see that. You know, he was that good.</p><p>He was that good. He was an even better person, man. He would've loved to be his teammate. Cool as a fan, man. Best dude. I'm telling you, man, we were in Vegas. I went to Summer League, and, like I said, I just wanted rickety. I played really well, and, man, we were all down there playing the little dollar slots, clowning around, and, you know, people were coming up to us.</p><p>Man, Greg came down to the lobby. Man, it was mayhem. People were going, I was like, we got the league. Security was like, man, we was gonna take you guys back to your rooms, 'cause people just went that crazy, and I was like, damn, he's that big. So it was real special to see Greg again.</p><p>You know, Kevin Durant has blossomed to, you know, he's one of the best players to ever play the game, and then Greg Owen was right there with him. You know, they were, you know, again, like I said, even then, it was no who's better. It was just, you know, they're both gonna be great players.</p><p>It's just a matter of what's gonna, or who you're gonna take, and that's what made it, that's what made it like, man, I just hate that the world couldn't see, you know, him at that Kevin Durant level, 'cause they would still, they would probably still be rivaling each other, you know what I mean, going at it, 'cause he could protect that basket, Kevin Durant could stretch the court, so, you know, I thought they had that kind of vibe.</p><p>- Greg, actually, you know, I don't know if you had to do the rookie transitions back in the day. - Yeah, heck yeah, we did, man, it changed. - So, when I did mine, Greg came down there, and he gave his whole, you know, I think it was the first year he did it, he did a whole speech, and that's when I really like, I think I hollered at him after, just, man, I connected that, because I got injured, I didn't know at the time if I was ever gonna be the same, I wasn't playing at that time, and he was saying, kind of when he was talking to the whole group, like, about what happened after that, like, he got hurt, you know, and then eventually, he's out the league, and like, the toll that took on him, you know, he talked about, man, he just, he was in a down place, like, I think he said he went to the woods, you know, was just drinking too much, like, every day, like, - You could tell he was depressed.</p><p>- Yeah, he was, you know, that obviously was a lot, and like, even for you, you went through these injuries, people talk about you could've been an all-time great, does any of that stuff ever, like, weigh on you the same way, and do you ever think about, kind of like, what could've been, or are you completely past all that?</p><p>- You know, I would say compared to you and Greg, the way I look at it, it was, I was able to get the early years, so, you know, when it did come to that decision of saying, like, this is just getting too painful to keep trying to rehab and play through, I was older than where, you know, Greg was, and, you know, the thing I always felt bad for Greg, because, you know, again, we didn't have this, it wasn't the social media era, but the era we came in was, it was tough, because, you know, I think the country was in a recession, you know, they don't even feel right giving you money, you know, in the league, so it was like, we were under that scrutiny of, but are you really worth it, or, you know, every time the wind blows, you're hurt, so we had to deal with a lot of that media presence that can really wear on a person, so you can see it with Greg, because the media put 'em here, and then the media felt like they had to bring 'em here, and that was the disappointing part, our time that we lived in as players, it's like, you know, there was days where, you know, I was really in pain, but I didn't want to hear the radio shows, and people going, oh damn, he's hurt again, so I would try to play, and I would keep trying to play, because I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want to deal with the naysayers, and then you gotta deal with the side of contractual-wise, they're like, you gotta pull teeth to get contracts, you know, so, you know, and I had heard Trae Young say that, and he was right in a lot of ways that we didn't have the social media, you know, towards the end, when I was in, I think Portland, 2010, you know, I was in a playoff game, and I think I played like five, six minutes, and, you know, I think it was Patty Mills, and they were looking through like their Twitters, and I was just like, what they say about me?</p><p>Fans was just going in on me, I was like, damn, how y'all do that? Like, how do you guys read it? - I can't, to this day, I don't do it. - I would be ticked, and I'm thinking in my head, like, man, I only played six minutes, how will I upload a damn gig?</p><p>But, you know, so, but then I kind of caught myself in understanding where young kids now, you know, you guys always got that, that everybody has access to tell you what you look like, so, for me, you know, I always just tried to, you know, block it out, but I definitely understand, you know, where he's coming from, but, you know, it's also, in our era, it's like, you know, I was a three-time All-Star before my second contract, and, you know, my negotiations was hard as hell, because, you know, you got owners losing money, you got everybody, and, where now, you know, I see dudes making, you know, double the money, and never really, you know, they're just still getting seen as the potential, and every era are gonna argue about which is harder, which is tougher, I just try to get advice to, you know, master your time, don't worry about what our era was talking about, you know, 'cause I'm sure I didn't go through as much as what guys did in the '90s, I just have a lot of appreciation for what they went through, so we was able to get more, you know, and then the next generation gets more, so that's how I just always pay it forward, because there'll be something the next generation will go through that you guys don't, try to explain to them what they're not seeing, so it's not never about looking backwards, it's always looking forward, but that was just kind of a, you know, what Greg had to go through in our generation, you know, it's like, then you can see the pressure from the general managers and coaches, it's like, well, you know, we gotta stick with 'em, you know, we gotta stick with 'em, and Greg felt that, you know, insecurity of maybe if they wanted to, or did they have to, 'cause we took 'em one, and then you got Kevin Rant, becoming one of the best players in the world, so he always had to deal with that, so I always felt bad for him, because he was a good dude, if he was a jerk, I think you wouldn't care, but he was a really good dude, so I was, you know, again, I was happy you asked that, you know, he was gonna be, he was on his way to being an All-NBA player.</p><p>- That's dope. So more as advice for, like, younger dudes, but going through everything you went through, what would you have done different, as far as, like, listening to your body before all the injuries, like, what, if you could go back, like, what would you do different than you did?</p><p>- Yeah, I mean, of course I would listen to my body, you know, I try to tell people, you know, because of our, you know, what do they call it, air, we had to, we had to play through some stuff, you know, it was like, we couldn't just say, look, I'm just gonna take this time and get my body right, you know, you wasn't gonna get the money you wanted, neither, so, you know, in order to change, like, that part of it, we would have to change a lot of things, but I would say that the one thing that I would have changed was how I prepared.</p><p>I always, like, wanted to go and prepare as far as play basketball, and I would have put more time into, you know, what I think, you know, a lot of younger guys do really well, you know, like yourself, is you guys put a lot of time into your bodies, as in, you know, sometimes you go to the gym and you don't hoop yet, you just do a lot of stretching, lifting, just, I would have really focused on that area of it, where I was a dude to, you know, I'll go in the gym and I'll do my lift, but then there's, like, I wanna get on the court and start doing some court stuff, where I would have changed that part, I would have probably put a lot more into, you know, I had a chef, but then it was like, man, I don't really know if I really needed a chef, I would have been more committed to that part of it.</p><p>- Yeah, but there wasn't as much research and as much, like-- - And they were trying, they were trying, though, Mike, I mean, I will say, like, we put a lot of, you know, especially with being hurt and then Greg being hurt, you know, we brought in a lot of people to really try to focus on those things, it's just we weren't, we weren't used to it, we weren't used to putting that much effort into something, you know, we weren't, you know, the research and the effort that they brought to us, we weren't into it, it was like, that's just not what we do, you know, and I think it's, you know, if you go back to the era before us, it's like, man, all that rehab and stuff, it's just, let's hoop, you know, so that's where I would have really focused on, I think young guys already do it, you know, focus on your bodies, you know, look for your body to be able to play until it's 40, you know, and whatever it takes, be into it, like be into, you know, nutrition, be into, you know, you should be able to teach strength and conditioning, you know, by the time you're 30 years old, because you're just, you got to really adapt and to get into it, to where as players, you know, I tried to really adapt to, you know, how their coach gonna think, you know, what's their scout gonna say about me, and I should have did more of that in the, into taking care of my body, I should have really just been like, man, I know my body really well, I'm eating better, you know, more consistently, just really buying into the, into the taking care of, you know, what's gonna, you know, provide for me, so I wish I would have did that better, you know, and not do it better, I wish I would have been more into it, and I think that would have gave me, you know, more years in coming into the league, being into that.</p><p>- Right, right, right. - My summers was like, all right, cool, we're gonna hoop, we're gonna work out, I didn't really lift a lot during the summers, and then, you know, I started to do it once I had more injuries, I started to try to catch up, but by then, sometimes it just feels like it's too late, so I wish I'd have came in a little bit more ahead of the curve in taking care of my body.</p><p>- That makes sense, yeah, I definitely think it's more of an emphasis now, a lot of it is 'cause of the guys' careers got cut short. - Yeah. - But man, off the court, like, off of the NBA stuff, you, I mean, the last few years, you obviously coached me for that year, Nathan Hale, you've coached Garfield a couple times, you've coached three years, three state championships, but like, now, what does life look like for you, and what are you really up to these days?</p><p>- Yeah, well, you know, I'll first say, you know, thanks to you, basketball coaches have been good, you know, I think it's no secret, you know, that team that we had, you know, helped, you know, my coaching, so, you know, when I first was like, okay, do I wanna coach?</p><p>You know, I kinda avoided it for years, I wanted to be around basketball, so, I'm like, man, I think I wanna coach. I finally just said, all right, Brandon, you're gonna have to get out of your comfort zone, and you can't be a player forever, but there's nothing wrong with being a coach.</p><p>So I had talked to Coach Romar, I picked his brain about a lot of stuff, and the one thing I wanted to know was, does it feel as good being a coach as it does a player in good games? And he understood what I was trying to ask, he's like, man, when I play and I go home after I played and we did good, it's like, yeah.</p><p>I'm like, do you feel good like that as a coach? 'Cause you didn't play. - What'd he say? - He said, no, it's not like that, but it's close. And he said, do you understand that? I was like, yeah, he said, it's close. So, coaching you was cool because, you know, when you play in the NBA, you're around talented players, so it's like, man, I gotta go to high school, I gotta kinda, you know, I don't wanna say dumb you down, but the players aren't as good.</p><p>But when I seen you, I'm like, ah, this is like coaching a pro. So, I was happy about that, but I was also happy at the same time because I felt like I was back being around basketball again. So, to coach, you know, you guys that year, it was cool because it's like, I didn't have the experience, but I had the player.</p><p>So, it helped me where I wasn't as prepared, you were over-prepared being good. So, that was like, you know, that was a blessing for me. And, you know, even Coach Romer said, you gotta enjoy it now because everybody ain't gonna be as good as Mike year after year. You know, you gotta have to, you know, lower your expectations.</p><p>And not to say that the kids, you know, there's only one number one player in the nation every year, you know, so everybody ain't gonna get that. And for me to have it my first year, you know, I still found the joy in coaching kids that weren't the number one player, but it's just the difference that goes with it.</p><p>So, coaching has been, it's been fun. It's been fulfilling. You know, the one thing I will say is, and Coach Romer came to the game when we were in Portland and we beat Sierra Cane for the championship. And I remember dapping him up after the game on the court, and I was like, I feel like I played today.</p><p>You know? - We was hype. - I was like, I gotta be real with you, it felt like I played. Like, so then I got the understanding of, you know, me and him have moments, coach player moment, and I was like, coach is juice, you know? I seen that, I felt it.</p><p>I was like, damn, I really went back. It was like laying in bed, like thinking about the game, like I played. - We was so lit. - So that was the moment that I knew like, okay, coaching is fun. It gives you that competitiveness. You know, you preparing before the game, can't sleep, thinking about this, thinking about that.</p><p>So it gave me all that competitiveness I needed back. And I also felt like, you know, the wins were like, I felt good. Like, that was crazy, we won that way. - I know. - Even when we were in, where was it? We played Oak Hill in, yeah. And I think we were-- - We was in Boston?</p><p>- That was Boston, yeah. And after the game, I think I told you guys, I was just like, man, we're gonna be the number one team in the nation on Monday. You know, USA Today, like that's-- - Like bro, when they talk about arguably the best teams ever, they put Nathan Hale in there.</p><p>- That's crazy to me, but we were a part of it. You know, and I think that's the part that, you know, you gotta always take with you. And I told PJ this, it's like, man, don't let people erase, you know, your history. You know, it's always good to be proud and think about stuff you did that was cool.</p><p>And there's nothing wrong with it. So, but I remember being in the locker room after we won that one. I was like, damn, we really doing it. And that's something I dreamed of as a player, but never accomplished it. But now as a coach, it's like, it feels like I'm right there with you guys.</p><p>And I felt like a player. So, you know, anybody that, and I try to tell guys that can't play no more injuries, it's like, man, coaching is not a bad way to go. Like, you know, you get to get into it. It's fun. And it's another way to be able to be a part of the hoop, which we love, but it's just in a different way.</p><p>You know, it's just more strategy. - Man, I tell people all the time, I told this to my AU team, and I tell this to like the young dudes or the coaches that were gonna coach my AU team. Like, I tell them about how you coached me. Like, it wasn't, man, there was no pressure.</p><p>You said, man, go out there, be you. It was ultimate. The way your coaching was was ultimate confidence. It wasn't like, you know, some coaches got all these little things you gotta follow, which isn't a bad thing, but your approach was confidence. And that's why we were number one team in the country, 'cause we just went out there and hooped.</p><p>And obviously we had to get along off the court. But man, the way you coached me, like the jump I took from my junior year to my senior year was the biggest jump I took. And it was a large part to you. I mean, we'd be in the gym, I'm working on my footwork with you.</p><p>Obviously that helped. But like the way that you coached me, it took my game to the next level. - But you know, that's what I thought. It just worked. I don't know how we, you know, we meet at that point, but I always looked at it like, man, he's really good.</p><p>You know, so I never wanted to make it confusing. It was like, whatever you wake up in the morning and figure out, you can do it. So I never wanted to step on your toes in that way. So I said, well, what's the best way I can help Mike?</p><p>First was make sure you're confident. If you're confident, then the team's gonna do fine. And then the next thing was just not, guys around you be complacent to go, oh, we're just gonna, you know, so I'm like, oh God, I gotta kick this guy's butt. Or I gotta kick this guy's butt.</p><p>Or in practice it's more like, you know, Mike, you know, let's split it up. But these guys need a little more work because, you know, in harder games, you're gonna need 'em more than, you know, maybe, you know, 90% of the games. You know, you could probably, you can't win by yourself, but to win championships, you're gonna need, you know, these guys around.</p><p>So no, I just wanted to give you confidence. I always told, you know, like I always talk to my parents, no matter what I do, it's like, mom and dad are always gonna be, you know, rocks because that's who I sat with as kids and bounce stuff off. And my mom had told me, she said, you don't have a big ego, so you'll be okay as a coach because you won.</p><p>- Exactly, that's what it was. - But she's, that's what she, and I was, when I talk to you and other people, or other players, it's just the same thing. It's like, I don't feel like I gotta put my stamp on it. It's like, nah, if we win, that is the stamp.</p><p>So with you, it was more like, I don't need to prove to nobody that we're winning. You know what I mean? So I don't, but I didn't feel like I had a personal thing to prove to anyone. I'm like, but let me show I can draw this up, or let me show you that my scheme is working, or let me, because I never looked at it, was it about me, it was about the team.</p><p>So, and each year is different. Like, I can't play, you know, this upcoming season like I did when we had you. I gotta go cater to their strengths. So my biggest thing was just to try to cater to your strengths, and then I think the rest filled in. You and Tay being brothers helped because him being a second best player, you guys already had your chemistry.</p><p>So he was like, yeah, Mike's the guy, and I'm right there with him. I'm riding with him. So I didn't have to worry about my two best players having a problem, because my two best players were brothers that you guys just had, you know, you guys had chemistry, great chemistry.</p><p>So, like I said, my job was easy the first year. It was really, it was sweet, you know? You got me started on my coaching. I'm like, people ask me about coaching. I'm like, you guys gotta thank Mike, man. Mike got me coaching. He got me in the game, you know?</p><p>So no, I appreciate that. I mean, you were the, you know, hardest working dude. I tell the kids that I coached after you. I said, I had a player who's the number one player in the country. He worked harder than everybody on the team. So if I got a guy who's not working that hard, then, you know, he might wanna start playing basketball now, because if the number one player works the hardest, how hard you think you gotta work, and you top 100?</p><p>So those messages and the little things helped me with these guys now. - It was a fun year, and I appreciate you, man. We wrapping it up, but I got one more personal question, then I got just a fun question. - All right. - Man, so we talking about your life, like the last few years.</p><p>Man, I remember getting the news a couple years ago, you and my guy, Deli, y'all got popped. - Oh, yeah. - Y'all got, my mom, I think my mom told me, she's like, Mike, on Twitter, it said B-Roy got, B-Roy and Del got shot, like, but I don't know any more news in my heart.</p><p>Like, I remember, like, bro, it felt like one of my brothers had died or something, like, I didn't know if you, I didn't know what happened. - Yeah. - Man, walk us through that story, and, like, how you got shot, bro. - Yeah, so, you know, I'll be honest, I never really spoke about it.</p><p>I don't wanna say I've avoided it, but, this the thing with getting shot, especially from, you know, the, I don't wanna say culture, I don't even know the right word to use, especially from where, you know, I know I came from. You know, sometimes getting shot can get, it can kind of create its own story, you know, and, you know, from when I was growing up, it was like, if a dude get shot and survive, you know, it made him almost cool, you know, and I never wanted to, I never wanted the message to be put out there a certain way.</p><p>- You ain't never talked about it. That's why I didn't know if you was gonna answer. - Yeah, no, again, and it's for the reasons of, I never want kids to, 'cause there's too much, you know, violence, you know, especially with, you know, people getting shot and those things, and, you know, I don't never, I don't wanna detail it, but the part that was really sad was that, you know, there was just so many kids out there, and to see, to see that kind of, you know, shooting and things going on with no regard for families and kids, and, you know, not even knowing who I was, was like, I felt bad for the people in that community.</p><p>You know, like, damn, you guys have to live under that kind of threat. - Yeah. - And again, it was, I was just, I had a lot of mixed emotions, you know. We always talk about what we're scared of, but until you're pushed to that envelope, is when you find out, and it's not just getting shot.</p><p>It could be a car accident, plane, whatever it is, and I remember, like, you know, when I was running, and I finally, you know, ran around a corner, and I sat down, and I was like, whoa, I got a hole in my sweats, like, what the? So, the thing that scared me in, you know, even to this day, every once in a while, I have a bad nightmare about 'em, is I thought about my kids, and I thought about a world that is, you know, it's chaotic, but them having to grow up in it without me being there to be that buffer, and I was just so worried, and I remember, you know, I finally, you know, they cut my pants off and stuff, and I'm in an ambulance, and I'm like, I wanna call my kids, and I wanted to call 'em for the same reason where, you know, you hear the news that somebody gets shot, you think the worst, and I was like, I wanna tell them before they hear from anybody else.</p><p>So, I got to get on the phone with 'em, and I was like, hey, I got shot. I said, I'm not hurt, I'm okay, but I don't want you guys to get that feeling of, you know, somebody calling my kids or, you know, their mom saying, he got shot, and we don't know what's going on.</p><p>So, I never want them to feel that, like, oh, crap, is dad not gonna be around? But again, the fear of being not in their lives, because there's just so much crap. It ain't, it's not just, you know, shootings. There's a lot of stuff that goes on, a lot of manipulation that goes on in this world, and I just would hate to not be there for 'em.</p><p>But, yeah, nah, I never really detailed it. I never wanted to seem like I was coming across as, like, you know, it's nothing to ever glorify, because, you know, it could be over that fast, and it reminds you of that. So, nah, you know, it's hard to go, I guess, into details of it, but I really felt bad for the people that was there.</p><p>You know, that, you know, I had a couple, you know, little cousins and things, and, you know, I talked to 'em a little bit after, but, you know, they gotta go, so they started school, and it's just like, man, it wasn't that big of a deal, I guess, that that happened.</p><p>- Down there, yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, and that's where I felt really bad, and I felt really, really, you know, good that, you know, my kids aren't in the same environment. You just want to be able to, you know, hopefully be able to help more people that are in those dangerous situations.</p><p>- Yeah, that makes sense. For you, did it, do you feel like it changed any of your values, or anything that you, like, look to in this life to fill you, or perspective-wise, anything like that? - You know, I'm pretty solid with, like, my beliefs. You know, I don't, I'm not easily swayed.</p><p>You know, even though it was an unfortunate incident, I don't, I don't have, like, any ill will. You know, I have forgiveness, you know. For me, it's like, you know, they couldn't have, whoever did it, couldn't have possibly known, 'cause I didn't have any problems with anybody. So, it's just like, you know, I'd rather forgive, and hope that a person can see that I forgive them for something they, for almost taking my life, and hopefully they can be better people going forward.</p><p>Like, you know, hopefully it's, it ain't about a person getting caught, it's just hopefully a person changing, really, and never, and never doing that again. You know what I mean? And hopefully talking somebody else out of doing that. And if that's the, if that's the, if that's the message, then that, that's what makes me happy, 'cause it's like, it always hurts worse when you know the person, but if you don't know anybody, you know you didn't have any problem with them, then it's like, you know, you almost took somebody's life, so don't do it again, 'cause that's the, that ain't how you wanna live.</p><p>So, no, I don't, I don't know. I mean, my perspective is just, you know, again, I just hope that we can stop getting these kids to, you know, stop shooting each other, you know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - But giving them something else to do, you know, and something else productive where they feel, feel a part of things.</p><p>- Yeah. Stop, man, last question. Obviously, man, you 37, you can't say. - Don't tell my kids at 36. - You a young boy. You got, like, a lot of life left. And I know, for me, I think about after basketball, like, what do I, what am I gonna view as my purpose?</p><p>Like, what am I gonna even wanna do? - For you, kinda like, what's your, what's your goals moving forward and what's your, what do you feel like your purpose is moving forward? - Yeah, I would say my goals now, my son's gonna go to high school, so it's, number one is my kids.</p><p>Like, just seeing their progression. You know, now I'm, you know, seeing him into that high school realm. I really wanna get in the gym, what even, work, what even, and hopefully, I guess, sum it up, push them to reach their goals. You know, my parents did a lot of sacrifices so, you know, I could reach mine, and I wanna be able to do the same for them.</p><p>As far as, you know, just, you know, my parents are great, and I wanna be great to my kids. I still wanna, you know, I wanna coach. I love being a part of coaching. I'm not sure, you know, I think I wanna get more involved in, you know, maybe team building.</p><p>I've always been, you know, really big on personnel fits. I'm not sure where that lies. You know, I do like coaching, but I don't know if I'm more of a, you know, helping, you know, evaluate talent, you know, helping evaluate, you know, personnel, you know, what guys fit, chemistry, you know, all that type of stuff.</p><p>But, you know, other than that, man, my faith is always, you know, it's always in Christ. So, you know, at the end of the day, that's where it's always gonna lie. You know, if I'm good there, I feel like I'm good anywhere. So, you know, I know it sounds, you know, a lot of people think it just sounds cliche, but if you feel like you're right there, then, you know, all that stuff in the world will take care of itself.</p><p>- You ain't lying. That was dope. Well, man, listen, I appreciate you being on here. I feel like you shared a lot of wisdom, a lot about you and where you at. I know a lot of people be wondering where you are, 'cause you don't really do know anything.</p><p>- I'm gonna come out a little bit. - You don't never come outside, but appreciate you, my guy. - No doubt, man. Thanks for having me. - You already know. - I got to come out with you, you know, and do an interview. - Got to, for sure. Yes, sir.</p><p>(upbeat music) (upbeat music) (hip hop music) you</p></div></div></body></html>
