So some of these are like yeah is the future good rather than bad? If there was a global civilizational collapse would we recover?</p><p>You know how likely is a century's long stagnation? There's almost no work done on any of these topics and yeah companies aren't interested too grand in scale. And then academia I think has just developed a culture where you don't tackle such problems in academia. Partly that's because they fall through cracks of different disciplines and partly because they just seem too big or too grand or too speculative.</p><p>I'm not saying that like all of academic inquiry should be like that but should there be at least some people whose role to really think about the big picture, and I think yes.</p></div></div></body></html>
