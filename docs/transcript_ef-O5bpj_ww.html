I don't think I have a perfect solution for the cloud. So for a while I use Dropbox. And then when I started recording videos for the podcast, we ran out of space. So I switched to Google drive because I got more space with our Google workspace account, but the recent purchase that I made that I am really, really happy with is the Synology 923 plus it's a network attached storage device.</p><p>So it's called a disc station DS 923 plus, and imagine a little device that just has a bunch of hard drives in it that you can plug into your network at home. You can attach it to your computer as like a network storage drive. But the thing I love about it is that it syncs everything instantly with the cloud.</p><p>So for example, if I'm finishing recording this episode and I take the audio and video files and I put them on that network drive, it's really fast because it's local and it's connected via ethernet, but then that device backs everything up on it in a few folders with the cloud.</p></div></div></body></html>
