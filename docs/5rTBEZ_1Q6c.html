So the answer is, and these are really rough statistics. Actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">one of my pet peeves is people who quote, oh, the rate of this is 27.43%.

The ballpark figure is Americans in the last 20 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">more than that, about 20% of Americans run into some addiction, substance addiction problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">either alcohol or drugs. People with ADHD have a rate that's almost double that, and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">higher in men than in women. Double.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost double, almost 40% risk. And that's for substance abuse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">not behavioral addictions. Yeah, that's substance abuse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's looking at abuse, and we can get into the related topic of what's misuse and versus abuse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and I have pet peeves there. However, kids who are put on stimulant medications when they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">young, and I should say the stimulants themselves do have a small potential for addiction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but putting kids on stimulants pretty much normalizes their rate of addiction problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it protects them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a really important point that I think maybe we just hover on for a second,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">because I think many people, including myself, assume that, well, if you were, you know, putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">these kids on amphetamines, of which, you know, many of the medications for ADHD are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're creating kids that are addicted to amphetamines or to a hyperstimulation period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're telling me it's actually protective to put kids with real ADHD on medication for ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I can say not absolutely every study has found this, but several large meta-analyses have gone back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and most of them have found this fairly dramatic benefit to being on stimulants as a kid in terms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of specifically reducing substance abuse risk. And some of them that have looked at this, when I said it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">was a yes and, it seems to be that it's not just the impulsivity traits, but some of the inattentive ones, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if your teacher's lecturing about the risks of alcohol or this and this, and you're zoning out at the window</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and looking at the plane flying by, you have less pertinent information on the topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You may be less attentive to the negative effects that other kids are seeing among the classmates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">who are stoners at this age or X, Y, or Z. So it seems that both the inattentive sets of ADHD symptoms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and the impulsive, you know, thrill-seeking, not weighing the consequences as heavily, are all contributing to this heightened risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I have this model in my head that is perhaps completely wrong, maybe partially wrong, and it goes something like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that we know that the neural circuits involved in executive control and directing attention and maintaining attention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and avoiding distraction, this kind of thing, use dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine, at least to some extent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know that people with ADHD are capable of focus, as you said, it's a failure to direct that focus, maintain, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've heard from you before this discussion that, you know, people that, you know, tend to drink lots and lots of caffeine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or who can drop into an activity but have a lot of distractibility that, you know, they might have ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm imagining here is that the threshold to get dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine released is either much higher or more complicated for people with ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what they're seeking is these catecholamines, these three chemicals, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that if they're given a medication that puts them in that range where they're getting it, then they're good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They can stop seeking it, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm raising this now because we're talking about addiction, addiction is a, you know, pursuit of things essentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess what I'm saying is it seems to me that the model of ADHD that we hear about is that, you know, people can't focus, you know, their dopamine circuits are all out of whack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you put them on this dopaminergic drug and, you know, basically you get them addicted to that tunnel vision or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I have this model in mind now that what we are all seeking is to have portions of our day where we are directing our focus towards a meaningful bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The things that are, you know, generative in our life, work, school, relationships, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that whether or not it's pharmacology or exercise or what have you, that it's just about getting into this plane of consciousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say that in no woo or abstract terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, are we really talking about here is a failure to access enough of these neuromodulators and these medications, which we're about to talk about, are really about putting us in the realm where those neuromodulators are just more accessible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">- I'll just say I can go with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">- Okay, well, you're the expert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I'm putting this together based on kind of what we're talking about, like getting enough sleep to me is a way of being able to have enough arousal during the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, exercise or these medications, just different ways of being able to access arousal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you don't sleep, you can't access arousal during the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rTBEZ_1Q6c&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you don't sleep, you don't sleep, you're going to sleep, you're going to sleep, you're going to sleep.</span></div></div></body></html>
