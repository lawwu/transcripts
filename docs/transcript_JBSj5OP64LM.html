And maybe they do, maybe they don't, I don't know. But from a physics standpoint, I tend to think of things, like physics was my main sort of training. And from a physics standpoint, essentially, if it loves you in a way that you can't tell whether it's real or not, it is real. - It's a physics view of love. - Yeah. (laughs) If you cannot prove that it does not, if there's no test that you can apply that would make it, allow you to tell the difference, then there is no difference, right? - And it's similar to seeing our world as simulation. There may not be a test to tell the difference between what the real world and the simulation, and therefore, from a physics perspective, it might as well be the same thing. - Yes. And there may be ways to test whether it's a simulation. There might be, I'm not saying there aren't, but you could certainly imagine that a simulation could correct that once an entity in the simulation found a way to detect the simulation, it could either restart, pause the simulation, start a new simulation, or do one of many other things that then corrects for that error.
