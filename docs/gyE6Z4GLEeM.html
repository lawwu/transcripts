target="_blank">00:01:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of the effects it produces when compared to the traditional leaf products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And unfortunately, that has confused, and in many cases, harmed consumers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So today you'll learn about

target="_blank">00:01:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">ways, you'll learn about how it can be a stimulant, how it can increase focus, how it can be a painkiller,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">how it can increase euphoria, but also its strong potential for

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">However, we are also going to explain the potential harms of Kratom, in particular in young people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">whose brains are still developing, and in people that don't have a prior opioid addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Our discussion about Kratom also opens up a broader discussion about other plant alkaloids that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">medicinal properties, including those found in things like cocoa and 100% chocolate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we discussed the incredible history of soft drinks like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, 7-Up, and Dr. Pepper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">which, believe it or not, were originally developed as pharmacologic tools before becoming the ultra</span></div><div class="c"><span

also many of you perhaps have not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What everyone should know, however, is that Kratom products are pretty much everywhere now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You can find them in supermarkets, convenience stores, online, and they're sold under the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:03:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's often in the fine print.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So could you just tell us what Kratom is, where it's found in nature and in the United States,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and some of its properties that people take it in order to achieve certain

And you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">think of it like if you sat down and you drank a light beer and you drank that 12-ounce beer in, in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">short period of time, just you, you could really drink it fast.

It's a subtle kind of push toward, "Yeah, I'd like more of that, but I feel pretty good." And the anticipation of it is positive and you certainly can work and do other things.

target="_blank">02:10:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So they weren't hard alcohol, they were soft drinks or soft beverages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7831" target="_blank">02:10:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They also generally had effervescence to them or carbonation.</span></div><div

John Pemberton's story of Coca-Cola was, actually goes way back farther than Coca-Cola in terms of putting coca leaf into beverages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7876" target="_blank">02:11:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But we'll just stick with Coca-Cola.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7879" target="_blank">02:11:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So Coca-Cola definitely had cocaine in its original setting.</span></div><div

was problematic and addictive, there was pressure for him to take that out of the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7897" target="_blank">02:11:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, and what they realized was the coca leaf, and many people that chew coca leaf talk about the different varieties that are available within South America and different flavor profiles that are there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7912" target="_blank">02:11:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So the specific one that they used for Coca-Cola has a definitive flavor profile to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7920" target="_blank">02:12:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they took that out, it lost the flavor that people were used to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7927" target="_blank">02:12:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they decided to keep this

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7941" target="_blank">02:12:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The leaf comes from Peru, comes from a state-run company in Peru that oversees the production of the coca leaf, comes into this company in New Jersey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7954"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7957" target="_blank">02:12:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So they take all of the cocaine and all of the cocaine metabolites, essentially the alkaloids, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=7965" target="_blank">02:12:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about

that coca leaf extract, the de-alkalinated extract, de-cocanized extract, if you will, is the secret sauce, if you will, for Coca-Cola still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8149" target="_blank">02:15:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">as the World Health Organization reconsiders removing coca leaf from an international ban</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8157" target="_blank">02:15:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and looking at it as a potential product to work into food products and develop further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8164" target="_blank">02:16:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, it supposedly has no abuse potential as the leaf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8170" target="_blank">02:16:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, it's that story of isolating that one alkaloid out and sort of destroying the rest of it forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8178" target="_blank">02:16:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">However, Coca-Cola was smart enough to keep sort of a monopoly, if you will, on keeping that plant alive in their product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8187" target="_blank">02:16:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's there. And the next time you have a Coca-Cola or a Coke Zero, just realize that it's got natural product in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8199" target="_blank">02:16:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That's incredible. And I'll keep that in mind the next time I have a Coke Zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8204" target="_blank">02:16:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there any evidence that what's still retained from the coca plant in Coca-Cola is psychoactive and not just there for flavor?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8213" target="_blank">02:16:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a great question. And that's been debated quite a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8217" target="_blank">02:16:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So the one thing that we know is that probably it is not having any psychoactivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8223" target="_blank">02:17:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other thing that we know, back to my pharmacy days, we used to sell Coke syrup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8230" target="_blank">02:17:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So when Coke is sold for fountain beverages, it's the syrup that's then blended with the carbonated water to make Coca-Cola.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8242" target="_blank">02:17:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Coca-Cola. And that's why a lot of people say Coca-Cola out of a fountain is so much better than out of a can or a bottle because it is a sort of formulated on the spot product, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8254" target="_blank">02:17:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">On tap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8255" target="_blank">02:17:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, on tap. And Coke syrup, we used to sell out of the pharmacy for nausea and vomiting, particularly in pregnant women, is one of the safest things you could use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8268" target="_blank">02:17:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And it really calms and settles the GI tract. And this is interesting because one of the big benefits that people report drinking coca tea is that it soothes their GI tract and it calms their GI tract and it helps them be able to be alert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8289" target="_blank">02:18:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, the coca tea's got all the alkaloids in it. But that same GI tract benefit is still still there. And that's probably what's still remaining within that extract that's now devoid of the alkaloids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8307" target="_blank">02:18:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not paid for it by Coca-Cola.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8308" target="_blank">02:18:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">No. In fact, we went to Coca-Cola to see if we could work with them on developing some type of medications or something from the coca leaf. And I have a former colleague that is in their natural products division at Coca-Cola. And they said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8329" target="_blank">02:18:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">they won't even let us touch the coca extract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8333" target="_blank">02:18:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And they've also got all that cocaine that they've pulled out of the coca leaf in this plant in New Jersey. I can only imagine what the security is on this place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8341" target="_blank">02:19:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't, I don't know. But if you, you know, you can, you can fact check me on Wikipedia or, or, which is not a great place to fact check, but, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8350" target="_blank">02:19:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You got my agreement there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8351" target="_blank">02:19:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But the, but the, the, the Stepan company is listed there in New Jersey and their connection to Coca-Cola. And this whole, this whole story is actually out there in front of everybody to see. Um, it just takes knowing where to look and find it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8366" target="_blank">02:19:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Love it. Last question about soda. Is there still lithium in seven up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8371" target="_blank">02:19:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">No, lithium has gone from seven up, but that was the whole idea, right? Up mood, lift your mood up and lithium. And we know lithium carbonate is still used to this day as a treatment for, uh, psychosis. So I'm curious a bit about you, you know, like, uh, I know a few chemists. Um, there are a couple of good jokes about chemists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8395" target="_blank">02:19:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but it's clear that you love chemistry and you love the chemistry of plants and you're also interested in public health and you're interested in, I'm gathering, I'm not a psychologist, but kind of the, the, the psychology behind all of this as well. Um, when you were a kid, were you always, were you playing with the chemistry set?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8418" target="_blank">02:20:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you would think, right? No, I, interestingly enough, my, my father was a pharmacist and I, I just never really, um, I never really paid attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8430" target="_blank">02:20:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But I was always under tow. Uh, and so I saw what he did. And I, you know, I'd see him behind the counter at a store somewhere. Um, and just never really thought much about it. But I knew that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8446" target="_blank">02:20:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">He knew that he knew a lot about medicines and he knew a lot about, um, healthcare and, and, and what he was doing was really trying to benefit people and help people. Um, and I, I always thought that it'd be noble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8460" target="_blank">02:21:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And my mother, uh, interestingly, she was a stay at home mom, raised us kids, um, but was very much into education and was a teacher prior to myself being born. I'm the oldest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8474" target="_blank">02:21:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a sister, um, younger sister, Lisa, who's, uh, a nurse, by the way, nurse practitioner. Um, so medicine has stayed within the family and science has stayed within the family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8486" target="_blank">02:21:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But my mother, once we were old enough, uh, to be on our own, if you will, she went back and became a comprehensive science teacher at the high school level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8495" target="_blank">02:21:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just watching her work through getting her recertification, the education process and how passionate she was about, um, educating others, uh, obviously stuck with me as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8512" target="_blank">02:21:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those, those are the things that drove me. I have no idea where the, the sort of, I really think innate passion came for, for the chemistry side of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8523" target="_blank">02:22:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I was in high school, I did an independent, uh, chemistry project to get, coming back to caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8528" target="_blank">02:22:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I was just curious, like what, what's the best caffeinated beverage for me to be drinking so I can stay up as late as I can and have fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8537" target="_blank">02:22:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, at the time it was Jolt Cola, which doesn't exist anymore. Right. But Jolt Cola, uh, Mountain Dew was second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8544" target="_blank">02:22:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, drank a lot of Diet Mountain Dew in graduate school. I can't say I recommend it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8548" target="_blank">02:22:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I mean, that was our, I, I, I was a band geek in high school and, um...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8553" target="_blank">02:22:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">What instrument?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8554" target="_blank">02:22:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I played trumpet and I played piano and, uh, uh, a bunch of buddies and I would get together on Friday nights and we would drink a case of Mountain Dew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8563" target="_blank">02:22:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it was like everyone else is out drinking beer. We were doing musical things and, and drinking Mountain Dew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8570" target="_blank">02:22:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was kind of crazy, but, um, I just wanted to know what was there. Right. And I wanted to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8576" target="_blank">02:22:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I got Vibrin tablets and I extracted the caffeine out of the Vibrin tablets to quantify how much caffeine was in those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8583" target="_blank">02:23:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, still I didn't really think anything of it. I decided, uh, very late in my high school career that I needed to do something with my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8595" target="_blank">02:23:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I was bored in high school.

Um, and my father said, "You, you need to decide on something."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8611" target="_blank">02:23:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and so we, I said, "Well, pharmacy looks like it's been pretty good to you and our family. We've had a good, a good life."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8618" target="_blank">02:23:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So I went to pharmacy school and in pharmacy school, um, taking biochemistry and my first medicinal chemistry course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8627" target="_blank">02:23:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I got taught by a brand new assistant professor, someone very relatable, uh, you know, close in age, um, just thought the world of this guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8638" target="_blank">02:23:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, "Hey, I'm looking for anybody who's interested in working in a lab to, to come work in the lab."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8645" target="_blank">02:24:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, "Well, chemistry, he's cool.

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8878" target="_blank">02:27:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Lobeline was the compound that we worked on and made analogs of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8883" target="_blank">02:28:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we were looking at it, interestingly enough, coming back to the cholinergic nervous system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8888" target="_blank">02:28:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we were looking at it as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease because at that time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8894" target="_blank">02:28:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">um, a paper came out in science noting that smokers did not tend to develop dementia

also left the caveat of, do they actually live long enough to develop dementia?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8907" target="_blank">02:28:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the answer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8908"

class="t">I've gotten myself into real trouble covering nicotine with, uh, where I put the caveats after the statement about nicotine being, uh, potentially neuroprotective in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8937" target="_blank">02:28:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">People will take that,

target="_blank">02:29:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I always, uh, follow that statement with it raises blood pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8947" target="_blank">02:29:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's highly habit forming slash addictive.</span></div><div class="c"><span

to avoid it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8955" target="_blank">02:29:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But nonetheless, nicotine, which stimulates the cholinergic pathway, as you point out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8959" target="_blank">02:29:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">does seem to be protective against a loss of cognitive function, at least somewhat and loss of neurons, dopamine and cholinergic neurons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8967" target="_blank">02:29:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8969" target="_blank">02:29:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where I don't get

drove a lot of research back in those days to really see, could we, could we find something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8978" target="_blank">02:29:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the idea was the, the hypothesis really was, could we find a nicotine that one, wasn't addictive, two, didn't interact with the cardiovascular system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=8988" target="_blank">02:29:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And three,

yeah, but I, I think, you know, that, that led to me going to a postdoc at the University of Minnesota.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9019" target="_blank">02:30:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm working for opioid chemists that really defined chemically the opioid receptors through analogs of, of naturally occurring opioids like morphine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9031" target="_blank">02:30:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then, um, it kind of launched me into my own career of saying, Hey, I've worked now on natural products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9038" target="_blank">02:30:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though I didn't work directly with those natural products, I've always felt what I said earlier about this sort of balance in nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9046" target="_blank">02:30:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wanted to pursue natural products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9049" target="_blank">02:30:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when I got to the University of Mississippi, which happens to be a natural products mecca, uh, for, for pharmaceutical natural products research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9059" target="_blank">02:30:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the National Center for Natural Products Research there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9062" target="_blank">02:31:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the National Institute on Drug Abuse's, uh, federal marijuana farm is there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9067" target="_blank">02:31:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the only legal federal

was like landing in the perfect place to do what I wanted to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9076" target="_blank">02:31:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's where I started working on salvia divinorum and salvia divinorum, uh, generate a compound called salvinorin A, which is to this day thought to be one of the most potent hallucinogens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9088" target="_blank">02:31:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, non-nitrogen containing diterpene, we talked about terpenes, very similar, not very similar structurally to cannabinoids, but in composition, just carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9101" target="_blank">02:31:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It interacted, uh, with kappa opioid receptors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9106" target="_blank">02:31:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And kappa opioid receptors, there's a huge difference between mu opioid receptors, kappa opioid receptors, and delta opioid receptors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9114" target="_blank">02:31:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are the three sort of traditionally accepted, um, opioid family receptors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9120" target="_blank">02:32:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Mu, uh, is actually the Greek letter and was defined by Morpheus, the god of dreams, which is morphine got its name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9128" target="_blank">02:32:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where the mu receptor sort of nomenclature came from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9132" target="_blank">02:32:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And since it was related back to Greek mythology, they gave it the Greek symbol mu.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9137" target="_blank">02:32:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they found these other receptors, kappa and delta, they just maintained that Greek sort of nomenclature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9145" target="_blank">02:32:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We all know that mu is the primary target for clinically used analgesics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9149" target="_blank">02:32:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It also causes the euphoria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9151" target="_blank">02:32:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Kappa opioid receptors also have analgesic effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9155" target="_blank">02:32:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was for a long time thought that targeting kappa opioid receptors was the holy grail of painkillers because you got the same pain relief as you would get with something like morphine or even more potent opioids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9169" target="_blank">02:32:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But the animals didn't want to abuse it.</span></div><div

trials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9174" target="_blank">02:32:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And we learned something in psychiatry at that moment that kappa opioid receptors cause dysphoria instead of euphoria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9182" target="_blank">02:33:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So people don't like the effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9183"

was Mitragana speciosa with an incredible track record of study by SmithKline in French,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9287"

paper by Mako et al.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9306" target="_blank">02:35:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't remember

target="_blank">02:35:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the end of the day, they decided to not pull the trigger on full development because it was no better than codeine as an analgesic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9324" target="_blank">02:35:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And at that time was the emergence of a new class of drugs called the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which had no opioid activity, which were much safer, no habit-forming properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9352" target="_blank">02:35:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And Mitragana was even recognized back then as being very comparable to codeine, which is really for more moderate pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9360" target="_blank">02:36:00.740</a></span> | <span

whole another discussion, but it's much less potent than morphine codeine is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9368" target="_blank">02:36:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It has great anti-tussive properties for cough and that's why they put it in cough syrups and works better for that than it really does for pain control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9379" target="_blank">02:36:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was just an

there's no point in trying to compete with this new class that's safe, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9386"

target="_blank">02:36:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So they shelved the project at SmithKline and French.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE6Z4GLEeM&t=9391" target="_blank">02:36:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank God they did because that's what I found and that was when I realized nobody's
