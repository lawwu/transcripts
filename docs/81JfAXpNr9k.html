target="_blank">00:43:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're kind of responsible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2626"

can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">say yes to the stuff that is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really important to say no to push back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's still very hard, especially if your manager is like, hey, we need to do these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wrote this post with, I think, five ways you can say no that and many of them are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">say yes to say no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll share some of these quotes that you can steal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're also in this post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first two is someone asked you to do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You could say yes, but here's what's going to have to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If we do that, should we move forward?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And oftentimes they're like, yes, let's go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Or otherwise they're like, no, shoot, I don't want to, I don't want to deprioritize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Forget that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one trick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Two is you could say yes, but not right now because we got to stay focused on X because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2684" target="_blank">00:44:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of X, Y, Z.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you agree with that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do you think we should deprioritize that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So that often works really well because it basically communicates, again, here's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a very clear trade off and why it's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Another way you could say no is no, but how about we do X, Y, Z instead of that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to achieve a similar outcome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, this is when you have a better idea, but you want to communicate here's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we could basically do exactly what you want, but here's a better approach to doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Another way you could say no is no, but there's something there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like something to this idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">How about we explore this a little bit further?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the next step that I suggest.</span></div><div

no, I don't think this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81JfAXpNr9k&t=2730" target="_blank">00:45:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">good
