class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=6" target="_blank">00:00:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">including how I booked a $2,000 a night ocean view suite at the brand new Waldorf Astoria in Costa Rica</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=13" target="_blank">00:00:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for effectively under $300 a night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But this isn't just a trip review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to break down the exact strategies I used to make it all happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the best part, these tactics don't just work with points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They can unlock huge savings on cash bookings as well.</span></div><div

start with a trip we just took to Costa Rica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the whole trip was inspired by six Hilton free night certificates we had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I walk through this whole process, I'm going to show you how you could get a very similar if not the same deal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">which is effectively 65% off a five-star hotel with Hilton points, with Amex points, or even just paying all in cash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's first talk about how we ended up with all of these Hilton free night certificates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it all started when we opened our first Hilton Aspire card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a card from American Express.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The card comes with diamond status, which is Hilton's top tier of status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes with $200 in statement credits every six months for Hilton resorts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the big one is it comes with a free night reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll talk in a second about how those free night rewards work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But the card also comes with a clear credit each year, and it comes with a $50 every quarter credit for different flight purchases that you make on the card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It does have a high annual fee of $550.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm going to walk through why I think that annual fee is probably one of the best deals given how much you get from this card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So first off, how do these Hilton free night certificates work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So every free night certificate works for a standard room award.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're on Hilton's website searching for room, sometimes you'll see something that's 585,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of times you'll see some standard room award prices like 120,000 points, 80,000 points, 150,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">When there is a standard room available, you can use your Hilton free night certificate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, one of the only downsides is if you have status with Hilton, you get your fifth night free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're using free night certificates, there are no fifth night free benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So by having the Aspire card, we had one annual free night certificate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So recently, we also opened up a Hilton Surpass card, which is one tier below on the Hilton lineup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's $150 per year annual fee card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes with gold status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes with $50 in credits on Hilton every quarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it comes with a free night reward, but only after spending $15,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I should have mentioned that the Aspire card also has an annual night that you get beyond the regular one after you spend $30,000 and then another $30,000 to a total of $60,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we did was we got the Hilton Surpass card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We spent the $15,000 on the card and then earned a free night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I upgraded that Surpass card to an Aspire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I didn't even realize this would happen, but we got a free night certificate for the upgrade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we spent another $15,000 to get to $30,000 and got a free night again on the Aspire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then on the anniversary of that card, now that it's a Hilton Aspire, you get a free night certificate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there was a promotion when we opened the Surpass card to get a free night as part of the welcome bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We ended up with six free night certificates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll link to an article that the Frequent Miler wrote about how to maximize your Hilton cards with upgrades and downgrades if you want to play that game as well to end up with a lot of free night certificates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I really love these free night certificates because you can get a ton of value out of them as I'll walk you through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is how our trip started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">This was before we knew where we were going to Costa Rica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't know what we wanted to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We just knew that we had six free nights that we could use at a Hilton anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we decided we wanted to figure out what would be possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And my parents are amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And they made an offer to watch our girls for a week this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were really flexible with dates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But we thought it'd be even easier this summer when we could drop them off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And we didn't have to worry about them missing any school or my parents having to stay at our place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the first thing I did was I went to Rooms.Aero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's one of the award search tools for hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have this explore feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I went to explore Hilton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can go in and choose brands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I knew that because we didn't have our kids with us, we wanted to have a really nice luxury stay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We wanted to get a ton of value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I filtered down to just the Conrad, SLH, and Waldorf Astoria properties because I knew those were among Hilton's best properties out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can go in on this tool and you can search for what countries you want, how many nights in a row, what the maximum number of points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can start to search and look around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, they technically don't have a date search on the explore feature, but you can go to search and type in 2025-09 and filter down for September to try to find things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how I started this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And there were tons of options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The Conrad Bora Bora, which we've been to a few times, was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It always sets the bar for an amazing vacation from the West Coast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there was this new Waldorf that I'd seen an article about opening in Costa Rica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I saw it on the list of availability, it seemed like something that I just had to try out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It seemed like it worked for our dates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd been to Costa Rica 20 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife hadn't been there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And the dates worked out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a new hotel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Why not go for it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And dates were wide open for standard awards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm pulling up the list right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm recording this on August 19th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And for most of the nights, pretty much 100% availability every single night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're looking for this hotel, just keep in mind, there is a ton of availability next year, especially during the spring kind of prime season.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So it could be a pretty great option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those standard room awards were 120,000 points per night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I looked at the cash rate for this hotel, it was $9,041 all in for six nights in a garden view, which was about $1,507 per night after tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which, if we just used 120,000 Hilton points, would be 1.26 cents per point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And a little bit of a spoiler, we ended up in an ocean view room, which ended up costing $1,960 per night after tax, which would have been a 1.63 cent per point redemption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But talking about this in terms of cents per point and Hilton points is only really helpful if you have Hilton points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have free night certificates, then I guess you could figure out the value of each free night certificate was $1,507 or $1,960 if you're factoring in suites, which obviously is why I think the value of those free night certificates compared to the annual fee on the card plus all the perks is a totally great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's also look at someone who has no Hilton points, has no Hilton card, has no Hilton free night certificates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you go to the Hilton website, there's always an option to buy points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've read through the terms and conditions, and you can buy up to 240,000 points a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, normally points cost one cent, but they are pretty much always on sale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When I first wrote up the notes for this episode, they were on sale with a 90% bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now they're on sale with 100% bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would say pretty consistently, getting points for around half a cent is pretty easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today, if I go in and say, I'd like to buy 160,000 points, I get those 160,000 points for $1,600, but I get 100% bonus, which brings the total to 320,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let me talk about a couple caveats here that I think are important for anyone thinking about buying points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll talk about why buying points can be so lucrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So first, a new Hilton Honors member can purchase points 30 days after enrollment, if the account has some activity, or 90 days after enrollment with no activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So everyone should just go open a Hilton Honors account, because if you have to wait 90 days, you can start that timer now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the time you need it, even if it's a new account, even if you've had no activity, you've passed that threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, like I said, you can buy up to 240,000 points per calendar year, but you can also share points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could have a friend, a partner, a spouse, they could buy points, and they could send them to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You can send up to half a million points a year, and you can receive up to 2 million points a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So each Hilton Honors member is limited to six transfers to other accounts and six points-pooling transactions per year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The transfers are usually instant, but it can take a few days, especially with some new accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So all the more reason to set this up in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're looking at this trip, thinking six nights at the Waldorf Costa Rica, 120,000 points a night, you would need 720,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">However, because you get your fifth night free, you would actually only need 600,000 points for those six nights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could only buy 320,000 with one purchase for $1,600.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then for the remaining 280,000, I think one, you could just go purchase more points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't purchase all the points you need because there is a limit of 240,000 points purchased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could do some combo of purchasing another 80,000 to get to your 240 total with your bonus would bring you up to another 160,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You could have a spouse, friend, a family member.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They could just go buy the 280,000 points you need for $1,400.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You could open up a Hilton card where the signup bonuses are almost always more than 100,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you could transfer some points from Amex to Hilton at a one to two ratio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you needed that 280,000 points, it would be 140,000 Amex points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that's the best use of Amex points compared to buying them for half a cent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the end result is still fantastic because you're getting such a great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so just to keep in mind, if you want that Hilton fifth night free, you do need to have some amount of Hilton status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can get that from staying at Hilton for four stays would get you silver status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The Amex Platinum or Business Platinum comes with Hilton status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">All the Hilton cards come with Hilton status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is a Hilton status match where you can status match to gold Hilton status from almost any other hotel status, some of which are even easier to get or may come with other credit cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So really, really easy for you to be able to get Hilton status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This episode is brought to you

<span class="t">Now, if you're planning one of these stays, like I mentioned earlier, the Hilton Aspire card gets you diamond status, which also gets you free breakfast and an upgrade, or at least high on the upgrade list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those also come in handy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you wanted to buy the 600,000 points you would need for this stay, and keep in mind, this is a stay that when I went to book it with cash, which I didn't do, was $9,041.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You could buy those 600,000 points for $3,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're just looking at the Hilton website, looking at a sticker price of $9,000, thinking, this is too expensive of a vacation for me, you could, on that same website, buy the points you need for that trip, and you could buy them for 66% off the cost of that trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So $3,000 for points to get you a $9,000 vacation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously, if you already have those points, if you have free night certificates, it might be an even better deal for you because you don't have to buy them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is such an opportunity to get a great deal, whether you have points or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But I like to optimize even further, and because we had a bunch of other Hilton credits, we thought, how could we dial this trip in more?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have an Amex Business Platinum card, which gives you a $50 a quarter Hilton credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we also have a Hilton Aspire card, like I mentioned, which has that $200 every six-month Hilton resort credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And while Costa Rica's hotel was not on the list, there were a couple reports on Reddit of it posting, and it ultimately did for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we thought, gosh, we have all these Hilton credits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we make sure we get to use those?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we're going to have to eat at this hotel, if we want drinks, if we wanted to go to the spa, all kinds of activities we could book through the hotel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So these credits could actually make the cost of the trip even less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So one hack, if you're planning a trip far enough in advance, which we weren't doing, you can actually call or email the hotel and ask if you can make a deposit to your room in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And if your room is paid, it's even easier, but even with a points booking, you can often make that kind of a deposit in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not guaranteed, though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">However, I had this idea of booking our stay from the end of June to early July, which meant that we would overlap with Q2 and Q3, but we would also overlap with the first half of the year, January to June, and the second half of the year, July to December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would mean we could use our $200 Hilton Aspire credits, and we had two of those cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We could use each card's credit for the first half of the year and the second half of the year, totaling $800 of credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And I didn't even need to call in advance to prepay because we would be there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I would just need to make sure that in the first couple of days we were at the hotel, I could either make some charges to the room and pay them off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">or ultimately what we did was we would just make payment to the room as soon as we checked in and store that in our balance for the room that we could start using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So between our two Aspires and our three Amex Business Platinums, that's four $200 credits and six $50 credits, which was $1,100 of total credit that we would have for food, drinks, spa, whatever we wanted to build to the room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">As we were dropping our kids off, my dad reminded me that he actually had a Hilton Aspire card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">He hadn't used his credit, which was expiring in four days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he offered to let me take it with me and use that for the Hilton credits there, which added another $400.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, dad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that meant we had $1,500 of credit for the trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, one thing to keep in mind, you do have to call to use your free night certificates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And for some reason, sometimes they can't seem to book them all at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We ended up needing to make one three-night reservation and another three-night reservation back-to-back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There was absolutely no problem for the hotel to link those two together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So with hotels down, then it was time to look at flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We could have just paid for those flights for $750, a little more if we wanted to go down on the nonstop from San Francisco,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a little less if we were willing to change planes a little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">However, my first search on Google Flights, I had the PointsPath browser extension installed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and you could see that the United flight down nonstop from San Francisco to Costa Rica,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of being, I think it was almost $600, it was just 20,000 points plus $79.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">On the return, it wasn't quite as easy because that nonstop flight only flies on the weekends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We were coming back on a weekday, but similar on PointsPath, I was able to see just from Google Flights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that I could get back from the Liberia Airport, which is very close to the Waldorf, probably about a 30-minute drive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We could change planes in LA and get back in business class for $57,500 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, was that worth it compared to the $25,000 points in Coach?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think because we have a lot of miles, because we're going to take one trip a year with kids, it was for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but it wasn't that tough of a flight, so that might have been a better deal if you were short on points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">However, I set a bunch of alerts, hoping that some better availability would open up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">because I thought the price could come down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And sure enough, three days before leaving, I got an alert that American dropped the price of that flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">from $57,500 to $27,500, and because changes are free, we were easily able to do that, with one caveat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">For whatever reason, the flight from Liberia to LAX was available in business at that discounted price,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But the final flight from LAX to San Jose or San Francisco was not available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If we wanted to get all the way home, it was going to still be $57,500.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we wanted to just get to LA, then we could do it for less than half the cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I quickly looked, is there a flight we could buy from LA to San Francisco that was cheap enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that it was worth saving 60,000 points on the trip?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure enough, Southwest, 10,500 Southwest points for the flight, plus $560 in taxes and fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we, as I'd mentioned in a past episode, had earned a companion pass on Southwest this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That meant we got two flights for 10,500 Southwest points, plus $11.20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so obviously, that was a totally great tradeoff for 60,000 point savings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So these flights that would have cost us about $1,000 to go down direct and back one stop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">not even in business, probably would have been about $2,500 if we did it in business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">were only a total of 52,750 points per person, plus about $145 in taxes and fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I try to calculate whether we got a great deal, it's not fair to use the coach price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because we actually got a flight in business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's also probably not fair to say, what value did we get?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's use the $2,500 business class price because we never would have paid that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to use the $1,500 price, which is just me picking a number kind of arbitrarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

to swap the room because of the noise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.340</a></span> | <span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So we ran all the Aspires for the first half of the year, all the Amex

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And most importantly, it did not have a loud buzzing AC noise.</span></div><div

healthy essentials delivered straight to our door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And unfortunately, there are over 10,000 food additives allowed in the United States,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's hard to know what's actually safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I love that Thrive Market bans over a thousand harmful ingredients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Their team does all the

target="_blank">00:29:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, one brand we love from Thrive is Simple Mills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We feel so good giving it to our kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

of their sweet thins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Plus, Thrive Market has tons of filters, so you can easily shop by your needs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1784"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">because I find that the more protein I eat, the less likely I am to binge on those Simple Mills sweet thins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.060</a></span> | <span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk a little bit about the property and then some of the food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So geographically, there is a lot of elevation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't enjoy that kind of walking, there were golf carts everywhere to take you places,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think we really enjoyed getting a little bit of exercise going up and down the hill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And aside from one restaurant and bar near the lobby, almost everything else you do is kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of at the bottom of the hill near the pool and the beach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't have to do that much walking unless you wanted to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So we spent a ton of time there. Let's talk about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There are eight different swimming pools and four different hot tubs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Tons of different seating styles. There are cabanas, lounge chairs, actual chairs, couches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We never had any issue finding a place to sit, even if we came later in the morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">later in the afternoon. That said, the resort was not at full capacity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So that could be a little bit different if the resort was full.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And of those eight different swimming pools, two were for kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">One was kind of a few inches deep with some jets shooting up water, kind of like a splash pool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And another had this beautiful water slide that I kept wanting to use,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">but I couldn't bring myself to be the only adult in the kids pool without a kid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And speaking of kids, I think we both had a little bit of regret not bringing ours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they would have had an amazing time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a complimentary kids club and a teen club.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There was even an outdoor playground at the kids club.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It really made us feel like our girls would have had a blast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So next time we go, they will absolutely be coming with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, there's free sunscreen and aloe at the pool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the evenings at all the restaurants, if you ask, there is bug spray in case you didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">bring some.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you're going to leave the hotel, you definitely should bring bug spray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But I really just love when hotels make it easy and they put sunscreen, aloe, bug spray,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">available places so that you don't have to worry about it and you don't have to stress out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Right in front of the pool area is the beach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Similar to Hawaii, the beaches are public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are people that are trying to rent you jet skis or offer you massages on the beach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but they weren't that pushy like I've seen other parts of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The ocean temperature was amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There were some reefs right there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Lots of snorkeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do more sea urchins than I've ever seen in one place in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And the snorkel gear kayaks were all free to use, which I love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of my least favorite things about some resorts is feeling like every single little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.820</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:32:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So I loved being able to borrow snorkel gear anytime we wanted without any extra cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Down the hill from the pool was a gym and a spa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The gym was huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It had pretty much everything you could want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This wasn't a Hyatt, so there were no Pelotons to earn some extra points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was also an adult pool and two more hot tubs at the gym.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">If you wanted a little bit of quiet time at the pool, the spa was beautiful as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We considered using some of our credits there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're just not really that into spas when we travel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I did ask for a tour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It was beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They let me use the sauna in the steam room, which is really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's also another hot tub in the spa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So that brings the total for the resort up to nine swimming pools and seven hot tubs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">As for other activities, the concierge met us at our first breakfast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">added us to a WhatsApp group in case we needed help during the whole stay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and gave us a sense of what we could book through the hotel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">other

class="t">And so we ended up booking a trip to a place called Sensoria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We really wanted to get out into the wildlife and be able to go see Costa Rica and see some animals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and kind of just relax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And this seemed like a really great way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It was only about a two and a half hour drive versus some of the other rainforest places that you could go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.340</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:33:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a private property, but it had trails and thermal pools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And the price was about $165 a person if you drove yourself.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:34:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">which is why I would really recommend this place,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

in finding wildlife and getting into the rainforest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'd instead suggest doing is splitting your trip, spending some time down in near La Fortuna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">or on the Osa Peninsula, and really take the time to get into the

to spend, you know, more than five hours in one day in a car,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it would have been too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2126"

target="_blank">00:35:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you are on the Pacific coast and you want a really beautiful nature hike, Sensoria was fantastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Based on all the other reviews we read, I think we just got really unlucky in terms of the conversation we had and the wildlife we didn't see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would still say check that out if you're in the area and you want something like that to experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other end of the spectrum, we decided to go to Diamante

tourist destination, but they had a mile long zip line that overlooked the ocean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It looked really fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So we did the canopy tour there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It was five to six different zip lines and it ended at a wildlife sanctuary, which felt a bit like a zoo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But I was told that they don't use that word in Costa Rica, but it was really fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The super long zip line was awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's side by side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So you get to go together with your partner or your friend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was really cool to see a bunch of animals, especially because we didn't see them on our hike.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Tons of birds, wildlife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We saw sloths and the staff there was so well informed that we actually learned a ton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2190" target="_blank">00:36:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And while our kids wouldn't have been old enough to ride on a lot of the zip lines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">they definitely would have appreciated the wild animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2196" target="_blank">00:36:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They had a cool little kids adventure course and older kids were having a blast on the zip line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would definitely recommend this if you know what you're getting into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's definitely filled with lots of other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a quiet, secluded experience, but it was a lot of fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those are really the only two excursions we did outside of food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.340</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a really awkward hided couch at one of the restaurants.</span></div><div

the same level as everyone else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But honestly, we had such a great stay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2453" target="_blank">00:40:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I sent that feedback to the hotel after we left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.100</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:41:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And really, they were so minor that I just didn't want to feel like I wasn't calling them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would absolutely return no questions asked and probably bring the kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're curious, we did end up using all of our credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But one thing I didn't realize because we had a little extra at the end, at least this hotel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">this might be true everywhere, would let you put tips for specific people or departments on your bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so ultimately charging your card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't actually bring any cash on this trip, which was a mistake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We forgot to bring our debit card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was actually really, really helpful for us to be able to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really know that it worked because we did send a tip to the concierge we were in a WhatsApp with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And sure enough, within a few hours of doing that, we got a message from them that they'd received it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It was from a very

target="_blank">00:41:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Honestly, that might be true everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

leaving in the room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was a

use the Amex Hilton cards to get free night certificates, primarily starting with a surpass card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

by the way, includes the spend you get for the surpass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.100</a></span>

target="_blank">00:42:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We had two of those, so we were able to do it twice to get six nights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll include a link to an article all about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span

use PointsYet, Award Tool, Aways, Gondola, Max My Points, Stay With Points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2557"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to search for hotel stays, go back to episode 167, where we dove through all those tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I imagine any of them can achieve what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would say if you're staying at a Hilton property, make sure to have an Aspire at the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you stay so that you have that diamond status, you get the upgrade priority, and you get the free breakfast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">For flights, I love the PointsPath extension, but make sure you set some alerts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I did it at Award Tool, which let us save over 60,000 points by rebooking our return when those prices dropped.</span></div><div

taxes for our flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We spent six

then we spent about $1,500 in Hilton credit and another $1,000 out of pocket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So total out of pocket costs for this trip was about $1,100 for, it's hard to say exactly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but I would say somewhere on the order of $14,000 to $15,000 trip.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's either booking through a travel partner or booking through a hotel

get perks without status, without anything like free breakfast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like a free upgrade on availability, like property credit, usually $100 per stay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

There are discussion forums online where people trade these. People</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">often in our membership have been able to find ways to get them from other members swapping around.

So similarly, as you achieve tiers of status with Hyatt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you earn sweet upgrade awards or you earn milestones where you can pick things like sweet upgrade awards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">or points or other perks, you can't use a sweet upgrade award and a guest of honor certificate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So at one point, my parents were potentially coming with us on our stay to Carmel Valley Ranch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I told them, I have some extra things I can send you.

So we didn't have to find that out. But that is the one true benefit of globalist status</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is that because you have that status, you can use your sweet upgrade award and get both of those perks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And keep in mind that sweet upgrade award also works with paid stays.

Like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">globalist isn't easy to get.

We ate most of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">dinners at the main restaurant in the lobby. Food was fantastic. Every meal, they had these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">different sticker sets for the kids to help keep them entertained. I love when a restaurant or a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">property goes above and beyond to just make kids' lives easier because it is so appreciated by parents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to relax, to keep them distracted, and also to help them just sit still and relax for other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">people at the restaurant who don't have kids and maybe aren't as excited to hear kids running around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3499" target="_blank">00:58:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So they did a great job of doing that. As for things off the property, we did leave a few times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3504" target="_blank">00:58:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'll share a few recommendations. We stopped by Earthbound Farms, which is right down the street.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We picked strawberries, had lunch, highly recommend. Just a beautiful, relaxing place to hang out for a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">hours. We had heard from a friend of mine that the best dinner nearby is at a restaurant called Lucia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">which is at Bernardus. The stars didn't align for us, but next time we might check it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3526" target="_blank">00:58:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">However, we did swing through Monterey and Pacific Grove twice, and I've got a few recommendations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">there. One, playing in the tide pools. There are tons of them. We went to the Great Tide Pool, as it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3537" target="_blank">00:58:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">called on Google Maps. It was awesome. Kids got to see crabs, starfish, all kinds of stuff. We had some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">great ice cream a few times. We went to Revival and Colette's. We had a fun, awesome burger and fries at a place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3550" target="_blank">00:59:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">called Snack Shack, which is right above Lover's Point Beach. And we really wanted to grab a hot dog</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">at a place called Lucy's on Lighthouse, which a friend of ours told us was fantastic, but they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3560" target="_blank">00:59:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">closed when we were there, which was a huge bummer. And then finally, we stopped at the Monterey Aquarium,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">which is really impressive. And it's even better because kids under five are free, which both of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">kids, at least when we went, were, which is awesome. Finally, big shout out to Stephanie and Edward at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJAVnfPG4dA&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">front desk at Carmel Valley Ranch.
