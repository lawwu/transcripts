as some sort of a really narrow specialist, the keeper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.720</a></span> |

talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about these, but we're only
