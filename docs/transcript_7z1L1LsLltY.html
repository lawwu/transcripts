When Kelly called you, was it to be the V.P. on the Trump ticket? Was that asked? And did you consider it? And why did you say no to that, but then said yes to this? About three hours after the shooting in Butler, I got a call from him and he asked me if I was still interested in specifically in the V.P.</p><p>slot. And I said, no, I had no interest in being vice president. I grew up in politics and vice president is the worst job in Washington. You have no budget. You have no staff except what your budget actually all comes to the White House. If you do something that offends the president, he can literally, you know, he can take away your plane.</p><p>He can take away your staff and he can essentially put you under house arrest. And you know, I have very strong views on issues. And I felt like if I took that job, I'd be on house arrest probably on day three.</p></div></div></body></html>
