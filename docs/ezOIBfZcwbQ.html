So we've always kept our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">funds in that five to $600 million range where you really only need one winner per fund to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">return the fund. But let me let me go back to this point about you explain the math, explain the math</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of that you typically own 1520% of a winner. So just even less by the time. Right, exactly. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, if you own 10% of one deca corn, that's a billion dollars. And if it's a $500 million fund,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you've doubled your fund. But if it's a one or $2 billion fund, you haven't even paid back the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fund yet. So that's, I mean, this is how hard is it to hit a deca corn? Hard. It's hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Hard, hard, hard, really, really hard to hit to have had to in a decade. Yeah, I've had to an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">exact same time period to go back to this point about dry powder. So I think it's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">important. So this will be a little bit more of a bright spot. So in a weird way, so there's a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, stunning article in tech crunch just two days ago, that said that Tiger Global, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which the head of the company, he's a big fan of Tiger Global, he's a big fan of Tiger Global,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2496" target="_blank">00:41:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">hedge fund, as of the end of April, the hedge fund had lost about 45%.

And then just this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2521" target="_blank">00:42:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they closed a $12.7 billion fund in March.

But basically, what this article said is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this $12.7 billion fund that they just raised is already nearly depleted. It's something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">two thirds of the fund has already been deployed. So this idea that they've got like a lot of dry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">powder sitting on the sidelines, I don't think they do. And then meanwhile, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2550" target="_blank">00:42:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the other big crossover funds, D1, Co2, they are completely risk off, I don't think they were ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as aggressive as Tiger.

But they're just basically sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">on the sidelines till this thing sorts itself out.
