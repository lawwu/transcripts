I'll take them very seriously, very literally. One is, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">said, he struggles to see God's goodness.

First, Josh says we're struggling to see God's goodness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in all of this. That's exactly the right way to describe the difficulty. Namely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a problem to see. The problem is with us, not with God. And that's exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right. The struggle is with our seeing goodness, not with God's being good. There</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is some measure of seeing the ways of God in this world. Oh, taste and see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lord is good.

But on the other hand, Paul says we walk by faith and not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">by sight. Now we see in a mirror dimly, then face to face. Now I know in part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. Many times we have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">say with the psalmist, I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the Lord</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the land of the living.

Wait for the Lord, Psalm 27, 13. In other words, we believe, but we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to wait to see. There's a kind of seeing in believing. Yes, there is. There is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of seeing in believing, but we long for the fuller revelation of how it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all going to work for good. And in the meantime, we hear Jesus say, "Blessed are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the pure in heart, for they shall see."

It's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong to rejoice in the gift of a healthy child, but it is wrong not to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">rejoice in the gift of a child with a disability.

They are produced by the Spirit of God. When the joy is really in God and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thanks are really being offered to God.

The transition from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the hoped-for joy in a healthy child to the painful joy in the disabled child is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxu0Zh7Z1s&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a huge transition.
