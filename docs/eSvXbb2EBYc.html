target="_blank">00:05:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">build this intuition both from firsthand from our customers and kind of merge that and I think we have a pretty good intuition of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">actually works right

get easier to make AI products right like how much of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is just a moment in time I think this is a very very interesting question and I think the answer is actually twofold right so the first answer is yes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like yes it will get easier and we know this because we've seen it a year ago you had to give you know threatened to kill your you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">dpd4 in order to get it to output JSON right like it was like you had to threaten to kill its firstborn or something and now it's just like a parameter in the API like you're just like in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">fact here's the exact scheme I want you to output and it just works so those sort of things will get easier but I think the second part of this answer is actually no like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like like in a lot of ways it's not gonna get easier and I think that comes from the fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">communication is hard like communication is a hard thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">um what do I mean by this I actually um I'm a big Paul Graham fan I'm sure a lot of a lot of us are but I actually really really disagree with this and the reason why is so so he says it seems to me AGI would mean the end of prompt engineering moderately intelligent humans can figure out what you want without elaborate prompts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that's true like I think that if you can think of all the times you know you've your partner has told you something and you've gotten it wrong right like you completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">misinterpreted what they wanted right what their goal was think about onboarding a new hire right and like like you told them to do something and they come back what the hell is this right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">um I think it's really really hard to communicate what you want to someone especially someone that doesn't have a lot of context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvXbb2EBYc&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">so yes I think this is wrong the other reason why I'm not sure it's gonna get that

involves ranking those bucket spaces by what will drive the most impact for your business and finally recursive refinement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
