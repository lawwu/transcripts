Right now you're coming across as a needy person trying to understand. It's hard for me to say this, but if you keep asking questions, you come across as an inferior versus saying, now tell me about the hours at work here.</p><p>Talk a little bit about what's expected from us in our off hours. Talk a little bit about how we connect to each other in the company instead of, so how do we connect to each other? So what you're doing in this is one example is directing the person. Directing gives them the confidence that you can lead them, that you could lead them through the conversation and also that you can lead at the job.</p><p>And so that's a good example of me saying, shouldn't be a question. Sometimes you just need to make a statement, take control.</p></div></div></body></html>
