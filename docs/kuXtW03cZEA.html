reason is that there's additional nuance in the write-up and more details in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the definitions that they really appreciated so the point is it's really difficult to assess</span></div><div class="c"><span

means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and then last but not least

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">on the set of human radar evals that i was just talking about earlier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">so again we're asking raters to evaluate the answer on a given question on a scale from one to seven one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">being very bad seven being very good and you can see that in the new system it skews much more to the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">so clearly the results here look much more promising and much higher quality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">so this looked great we could have just launched it at this point but in addition to that we ran</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of additional tests on more product specific data sets to really help us understand where it worked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">well and where it had shortcomings and also ran a bunch of additional internal dog fooding to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">collect qualitative feedback from our in-house teams this actually helped us catch a few regressions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">so for example 4.1 was much more likely to start every response with the word certainly exclamation mark</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">which is not really what we were going for and it's kind of off-brand for us so we first had to address</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">those issues before we can roll it out to customers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so what are some things we learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">well first learning really is sharpen your axe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">at the end of the day a lot of evaluation is in my mind really an engineering problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">so the more time we invest in building out strong tooling great processes and documentation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the more it will pay back quickly in our case i could say it paid back tenfold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it became much easier to run evals which meant that more teams started using them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and use them more often and as such the iteration speed and our product quality really improved as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">as our own confidence in our product quality and which meant that we were confident in shipping it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">customers more quickly i didn't mention this earlier but we leveraged langsmith extensively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">for some subset of our evals especially a lot of the routine evals that pertain to when we break tasks down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but we've also built some of our own tools for some of the more human radar focused evaluations so i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">would say don't be afraid to mix and match and evaluate and find what works best for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">learning number two this is kind of the the flip side of this which is that evals matter but taste</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">really does too obviously having rigorous and repeatable evaluations is critical we wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to make product progress without them but human judgment qualitative feedback and taste really</span></div><div class="c"><span

raiders from our internal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">dog fooding and from our customers and we constantly make improvements to the product that don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">really impact evil metrics in any meaningful way but they clearly make the product better for example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">by making it faster more consistent or easy to use</span></div><div

more forward-looking and a bit of a hot take but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.620</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the most important data doesn't exist yet so maybe one reductive or simplistic take on ai progress in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the last decade has been that we've made a ton of progress by just taking more and more publicly available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">data and creating larger and larger models and that's of course been very very successful it's led to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">amazingly capable foundation models that we all know and love and use every day and they continue to improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.820</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">need more process data the kind of data that shows you how to get things done inside of those firms today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">so think about an

target="_blank">00:19:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this is how we do this here and so if we can extract that kind of data that kind of process data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

need lead to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">next breakthroughs when it comes to building agentic systems and this is something i'm really excited about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuXtW03cZEA&t=1180"
