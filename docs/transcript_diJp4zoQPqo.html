We understand that we're hardcore. And actually, there is a bit of nuance about how different companies respond to this. But our response has always been just to say no. And if they threaten to block, well, knock yourself out. You're going to lose Wikipedia. The following is a conversation with Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia. One of, if not the most impactful websites ever. Expanding the collective knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom of human civilization. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Jimmy Wales. Let's start at the beginning. What is the origin story of Wikipedia? The origin story of Wikipedia. Well, so I was watching the growth of... the free software movement, open source software. And seeing programmers coming together to collaborate in new ways. Sharing code. Doing that under a free license. Which is really interesting, because it empowers an ability to work together. That's really hard to do if the code is still proprietary. Because then, if I chip in and help, we sort of have to figure out how I'm going to be rewarded and what that is. But the idea that everyone can copy it and it just is part of the commons. Really. And it really empowered a huge wave of creative software production. And I realized that that kind of collaboration could extend beyond just software to all kinds of cultural works. And the first thing that I thought of was an encyclopedia. And I thought, oh, that seems obvious that an encyclopedia, you can collaborate on it. There's a few reasons why. One, we all pretty much know what an encyclopedia entry on, say, the Eiffel Tower should be like. You know, you should see a picture. A few pictures made. Maybe history, location, something about the architect, etc., etc. So, we have a shared understanding of what it is we're trying to do. And then we can collaborate. And different people can chip in and find sources and so on and so forth. So, set up first, Newpedia, which was about two years before Wikipedia. And with Newpedia, we had this idea that in order to be respected, we had to be even more academic. Than a traditional encyclopedia. Because a bunch of volunteers on the internet getting out of the right of an encyclopedia, you know, you could be made fun of if it's just every random person. So, we had implemented this seven-stage review process to get anything published. And two things came of that. So, one thing, one of the earliest entries that we published after this rigorous process, a few days later, we had to pull it. Because as soon as it hit the web and the broader community took a look at it. People noticed plagiarism. And realized that it wasn't actually that good. Even though it had been reviewed by academics and so on. So, we had to pull it. So, it's like, oh, okay. Well, so much for a seven-stage review process. But also, I decided that I wanted to try. I was frustrated. Why is this taking so long? Why is it so hard? So, I thought, okay. I saw that Robert Merton had won Nobel Prize in economics for his work on option pricing theory. And when I was in academia, that's what I worked on. It was option pricing theory. How to publish paper. So, I had worked through all of his academic papers. And I knew his work quite well. I thought, oh, I'll just, I'll write a short biography of Merton. And when I started to do it, I had been out of academia. I hadn't been a grad student for a few years then. I felt this huge intimidation. Because they were going to take my draft and send it to the most prestigious finance professors that we could find. To give me feedback for revisions. And it felt like being back in grad school. You know, it's like this really oppressive. Sort of like, you're going to submit it for review. And you're going to get critiques. A little bit of the bad part of grad school. Yeah, yeah. The bad part of grad school, right? And so, I was like, oh, this isn't intellectually fun. This is like the bad part of grad school. It's intimidating. And there's a lot of, you know, potential embarrassment if I screw something up and so forth. And so, that was when I realized, okay, look. This is never going to work. This is not something that people are really going to want to do. So, Jeremy Rosenfeld, one of my employees, had brought and showed me the Wiki concept in December. And then, later, I was like, oh, this is not going to work. And then, Larry Sanger brought in the same. Said, what about this Wiki idea? And so, in January, we decided to launch Wikipedia. But we weren't sure. So, the original project was called Newpedia. And even though it wasn't successful, we did have quite a group of academics and, like, really serious people. And we were concerned that, oh, maybe these academics are going to really hate this idea. And we shouldn't just convert the project immediately. We should launch this as a side project. The idea of, oh, here's a Wiki. Here's a Wiki where we can start playing around. But actually, we got more work done in two weeks than we had in almost two years, because people were able to just jump on and start doing stuff. And it was actually a very exciting time. Back then, you could be the first person who typed "Africa is a continent" and hit save, you know, which isn't much of an encyclopedia entry. But it's true. And it's a start. And it's kind of fun. Like, you know, you put your name down. Actually, a funny story was several years later, I just happened to be online, and I saw when I was writing a book, I think his name is Robert Allman, won the Nobel Prize in economics. And we didn't have an entry on him at all, which was surprising. But it wasn't that surprising. This was still early days, you know. And so I got to be the first person to type "Robert Allman won the Nobel Prize in economics" and hit save, which, again, wasn't a very good article. But then I came back two days later, and people had improved it and so forth. So that second half of the experience where with Robert Merton, I never succeeded because it was just too intimidating. It was like, oh, no, I was able to chip in and help. Other people jumped in. Everybody was interested in the topic because it's all in the news at the moment. And so it's just a completely different model, which worked much, much better. What is it that made that so accessible, so fun, so natural to just add something? Well, I think it's, you know, especially in the early days, and this, by the way, has gotten much harder because there are fewer topics that are just greenfield, you know, available. But, you know, you could say, oh, well, you know, I know a little bit about this, and I can get it. I can get it started. But then it is fun to come back then and see other people have added and improved and so on and so forth. And that idea of collaborating, you know, where people can, much like open source software, you know, you put your code out and then people suggest revisions and they change it and it modifies and it grows beyond the original creator. It's just a kind of a fun, wonderful, quite geeky hobby, but people enjoy it. How much debate was there over the interface, over the details of how to make that, you know, get seamless and frictionless? Yeah, I mean, not as much as there probably should have been in a way. During that two years of the failure of Newpedia where very little work got done, what was actually productive was there was a huge long discussion, email discussion, very clever people talking about things like neutrality, talking about what is an encyclopedia, but also talking about more technical ideas, you know, things. Back then XML was kind of all the rage and thinking about, ah, could we, you know, can we, you know, shouldn't you have certain data that might be in multiple articles that gets updated automatically? So for example, you know, the population of New York City, every 10 years, there's a new official census. Couldn't you just update that bit of data in one place and it would update across all languages? That is a reality today. But back then it was just like, hmm, how do we do that? How do we think about that? So that is a reality today where it's, there's some universal variables. Yeah, Wikidata, you can, you can link, you know, from a Wikipedia entry, you can link to that piece of data in Wikidata. I mean, it's a pretty advanced thing, but there are advanced users who are doing that. And then when, when that gets updated, it updates in all the languages where you've done that. I mean, that's really interesting. There was this chain of emails in the early days of discussing the details of what is, so there's the interface, there's the... Yeah, so the interface, so an example, there was some software called UseModWiki, which we started with. It's quite a mute. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so the interface, so an example, there was some software called UseModWiki, which we started with. It's quite a mute. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's quite amusing, actually, because the main reason we launched with UseModWiki is that it was a single Perl script. So it was really easy for me to install it on the server and just get running. But it was, you know, some guy's hobby project. It was cool, but it was just a hobby project. And all the data was stored in flat text files. So there was no real database behind it. So to search the site, you basically used grep, which is just, like, basic Unix utility to, like, look through all the files. So that clearly was never going to scale. But also, in the early days, it didn't have real logins. So you could set your username, but there were no passwords. So, you know, I might say Bob Smith, and then someone else comes along and says, No, I'm Bob Smith. And they both had it. Now, that never really happened. We didn't have a problem with it. But it was kind of obvious, like, you can't grow a big website where everybody can pretend to be everybody. That's not going to be good for trust and reputation and so forth. Yeah. Yeah. So quickly, I had to write a little, you know, login, you know, store people's passwords and things like that. So you can have unique identities. And then another example of something, you know, quite, he would have never thought would have been a good idea. And it turned out to not be a problem. But to make a link in Wikipedia in the early days, you would make a link to a page that may or may not exist by just using camel case, meaning it's like uppercase, lowercase, and you smash the words together. So maybe New York City, he might type any W. no space, capital Y, York City, and that would make a link. But that was ugly, that was clearly not right. And so I was like, okay, well, that's just not going to look nice. Let's just use square brackets. Two square brackets makes a link. That may have been an option in the software, I'm not sure I've thought up square brackets. But anyway, we just did that, which worked really well. It makes nice links and you can see in its red links or blue links depending on if the page exists or not. But the thing that didn't occur to me even think about is that, for example, on the German language standard keyboard, there is no square bracket. So for German Wikipedia to succeed, people had to learn to do some alt codes to get the square bracket or a lot of users cut and paste a square bracket where they could find one and they would just cut and paste one in. And yet, German Wikipedia has been a massive success. So somehow that didn't slow people down. How is it that the German keyboards don't have a square bracket? How do you do programming? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. How do you do programming? How do you live life to its fullest without square brackets? It's a very good question. I'm not really sure. I mean, maybe it does now because keyboard standards have drifted over time and becomes useful to have a certain character. I mean, it's the same thing. There's not really a W character in Italian. And it wasn't on keyboards, or I think it is now. But in general, W is not a letter in Italian language. But it appears in enough international words that it's crept into Italian. And all of these things are probably Wikipedia articles in themselves. Oh, yeah. The discussion of square brackets in German. The whole discussion, I'm sure. On both the English and the German Wikipedia. And the difference between those two might be very interesting. So Wikidata is fascinating, but even the broader discussion of what is an encyclopedia. Can you go to that sort of philosophical question of what is an encyclopedia? What is an encyclopedia? So the way I would put it is an encyclopedia, or what our goal is, is the sum of all human knowledge. But sum meaning summary. And this was an early debate. I mean, somebody started uploading the full text of Hamlet, for example. And we said, "Hmm, wait, hold on a second. That's not an encyclopedia article, but why not?" So HINCE was born Wikisource, which is where you put original texts and things like that out of copyright texts. Because they said, "No, an encyclopedia article about Hamlet, that's, you know, a book about the world." And so they said, "No, an encyclopedia article about Hamlet, that's not an encyclopedia article about the world." And so they said, "No, an encyclopedia article about the world." And so they said, "No, an encyclopedia article about the world." Because they said, "No, an encyclopedia article about Hamlet, that's a perfectly valid thing, but the actual text of the play is not an encyclopedia article." So most of it's fairly obvious. But there are some interesting quirks and differences. So, for example, as I understand it, in French language encyclopedias, traditionally, it would be quite common to have recipes, which in English language, that would be unusual. You wouldn't find a recipe for chocolate cake in Britannica. And so I actually don't think that's the case. I think that's the case. I think that's the case. I think that's the case. I think that's the case. I don't know the current state. I haven't thought about that in many, many years now. State of cake recipes in Wikipedia, in English Wikipedia? I wouldn't say there's chocolate cake recipes. I mean, you might find a sample recipe somewhere. I'm not saying there are none, but in general, no. Like, we wouldn't have recipes. I told myself I would not get outraged in this conversation, but now I'm outraged. I'm deeply upset. It's actually very complicated. I love to cook. I'm actually quite a good cook. And what's interesting is, it's very hard to have a neutral recipe because for me-- Like a canonical recipe for cake. A canonical recipe is kind of difficult to come by because there's so many variants, and it's all debatable and interesting. For something like chocolate cake, you could probably say, "Here's one of the earliest recipes," or "Here's one of the most common recipes." But for many, many things, the variants are as interesting as-- Somebody said to me recently, "Ten Spaniards, 12 paella recipes." So these are all matters of open discussion. Well, just to throw some numbers, as of May 27th, 2023, there are 6.66 million articles in the English Wikipedia containing over 4.3 billion words, including articles, the total number of pages is 58 million. Does that blow your mind? I mean, yes, it does. I mean, it doesn't because I know that, you know, I'm not a big fan of the English Wikipedia, but I'm not a big fan of the English Wikipedia. I mean, I'm not a big fan of the English Wikipedia. I mean, it doesn't because I know those numbers and see them from time to time. But in another sense, a deeper sense, yeah, it does. I mean, it's really remarkable. I remember when English Wikipedia passed 100,000 articles and when German Wikipedia passed 100,000, because I happened to be in Germany with a bunch of Wikipedians that night. And, you know, then it seemed quite big. I mean, we knew at that time that it was nowhere near complete. I remember at Wikimania, I think it was the first time I read about the book, I think it was the first time I read about the book, I think it was the first time I read about the book, I think it was the first time I read about the book, I think it was the first time I read about the book. And I remember at Wikimania in Harvard, when we did our annual conference there in Boston, someone who had come to the conference from Poland had brought along with him a small encyclopedia, a single volume encyclopedia of biographies. So short biographies, normally a paragraph or so, about famous people in Poland. And there were some 22,000 entries. And he pointed out that even then in 2006, Wikipedia felt quite big. And he said, "In English Wikipedia, there's only a handful of these." You know, less than 10%, I think he said. And so then you realize, yeah, actually, you know, who was the mayor of Warsaw in 1873? Don't know. Probably not in English Wikipedia, but it probably might be today. But there's so much out there. And of course, what we get into when we're talking about how many entries there are, and how many there could be, is this very deep philosophical issue of notability, which is the question of, well, how do you draw the limit? How do you draw, you know, what is there? So sometimes people say, "Oh, there should be no limit." But I think that doesn't stand up to much scrutiny if you really pause and think about it. So I see in your hand there, you've got a Bic pen. Pretty standard. Everybody's seen, you know, billions of those in life. Classic, though. It's a classic, clear Bic pen. So could we have a an entry about that Bic pen? Well, I bet we do. That type of Bic pen, because it's classic, everybody knows it, and it's got a history. And actually, there's something interesting about the Bic company. They make pens, they also make kayaks, and there's something else they're famous for. Basically, they're sort of a definition by non-essentials company. Anything that's long and plastic, that's what they make. So if you want to find the common ground. Wow. That's very platonic form. The platonic form of a Bic. But could we have an article about that very Bic pen in your hand? So Lex Friedman's Bic pen as of this week. Oh, the very, this instance. The very specific instance. And the answer is no. There's not much known about it, I dare say, unless, you know, it's very special to you and your great-grandmother gave it to you or something. You probably know very little about it. It's a pen. It's just here in the office. So that's just to show there's a, there is a limit. I mean, in German Wikipedia, they used to talk about the rear nut of the pen. Yeah. The wheel of Uli Fuchs' bicycle, Uli Fuchs, the well-known Wikipedian of the time, to sort of illustrate, like, you can't have an article about literally everything. And so then it raises the question, what can you have an article about? What can't you? And that can vary depending on the subject matter. One of the areas where we try to be much more careful would be biographies. The reason is a biography of a living person, if you get it wrong, it can actually be quite hurtful, quite damaging. And so, you know, if you're a biographer, you're going to have to have to have a lot of biographies. So if someone is a private person and somebody tries to create a Wikipedia entry, there's no way to update it. There's not much known. So for example, an encyclopedia article about my mother. My mother, school teacher, later a pharmacist, wonderful woman, but never been in the news. I mean, other than me talking about why there shouldn't be a Wikipedia entry, that's probably made it in somewhere, standard example. But, you know, there's not enough known. And you could sort of imagine a database of genealogy having date of birth, date of death, and, you know, certain elements like that of private people, but you couldn't really write a biography. And one of the areas this comes up quite often is what we call BLP1A. We've got lots of acronyms. Biography of a living person who's notable for only one event is a real sort of danger zone. Oh. And the type of example would be a victim of a crime. So someone who's a victim of a famous serial killer, but about whom like really not much is known. They weren't a public person, they're just a victim of a crime. We really shouldn't have an article about that person. They'll be mentioned, of course, and maybe the specific crime might have an article. But for that person, no, not really. That's not really something that makes any sense, because how can you write a biography about someone you don't know much about? And this is, you know, it varies from field to field. So for example, for many academics, we will have an entry that we might not have in a different context, because for an academic, it's important to have sort of their career, you know, what papers they've published, things like that. You may not know anything about their personal life, but that's actually not encyclopedically relevant in the same way that it is for a member of a royal family, where it's basically all about the family. So, you know, we're fairly nuanced about notability and where it comes in. And I've always thought that the term notability, I think, is a little problematic. I mean, we struggle about how to talk about it and how to use it. The problem with notability is it can feel insulting to say, "Oh, no, you're not noteworthy." Well, my mother's noteworthy. She's a really important person in my life, right? So that's not right. But it's more like verifiability. Is there a way to get information that actually makes an encyclopedia entry? It so happens that there's a Wikipedia page about me, as I've learned recently. And the first thought I had when I saw that was, surely, I am not notable enough. So I was very surprised and grateful that such a page could exist. And actually, just allow me to say thank you to all the incredible people that are part of creating and maintaining Wikipedia. It's my favorite website on the internet. The collection of articles that Wikipedia has created is just incredible. We'll talk about the various details of that. But the love and care that goes into creating pages for individuals, for a big pen, for all this kind of stuff is just really incredible. So I just felt the love when I saw that page. But I also felt, just because I do this podcast, and I just, through this podcast, gotten to know a few individuals that are quite controversial, I've gotten to be on the receiving end of something quite... To me, as a person who loves other human beings, I've gone to be at the receiving end of some kind of attacks through the Wikipedia. Mm. Like you said, when you look at living individuals, it can be quite hurtful, the little details of information. And because I've become friends with Elon Musk, and I've interviewed him, but I've also interviewed people on the left, far left, people on the right, some people would say far right. And so now you take a step, you put your toe into the cold pool of politics, and the sharp emerges from the depths and pulls you right in. Yeah. A boiling hot pool of politics. Yeah. I guess it's hot. And so I got to experience some of that. I think what you also realize is there has to be, for Wikipedia, credible sources, verifiable sources. Yeah. And there's a dance there, because some of the sources are pieces of journalism. And of course, journalism operates under its own complicated incentives, such that people can write articles that are not factual, or are cherry picking, all the flaws they can have in a journalistic article. For sure. And those can be used as sources. It's like they dance hand in hand. And so for me, sadly enough, there was a really kind of concerted attack to say that I was never at MIT, I never did anything at MIT. Just to clarify, I am a research scientist at MIT. I have been there since 2015. I'm there today. I'm at a prestigious, amazing laboratory called LIDS. And I hope to be there for a long time. I work on AI, robotics, machine learning. There's a lot of incredible people there. And by the way, MIT has been very kind to defend me. Unlike Wikipedia says, it is not an unpaid position. There was no controversy. Right. It was all very calm and happy and almost boring. Yeah. Research that I've been doing there. And the other thing, because I am half Ukrainian, half Russian, and I've traveled to Ukraine, and I will travel to Ukraine again. And I will travel to Russia for some very difficult conversations. My heart has been broken by this war. I have family in both places. It's been a really difficult time. But the little battle about the biography there also starts becoming important for the first time for me. I also want to clarify sort of personally, use this opportunity of some inaccuracies there. My father was not born in Chkalysk, Russia. He was born in Kyiv, Ukraine. I was born in Chkalysk, which is a town not in Russia. There is a town called that in Russia, but there's another town in Tajikistan, which is a former republic of the Soviet Union. It is that town is now called B-U-S-T-O-N, Buston, which is funny because we're now in Austin and I also am in Boston. It seems like my whole life is surrounded by these kinds of towns. So I was born in Tajikistan. And the rest of the biography is interesting, but my family is very evenly distributed between their origins and where they grew up between Ukraine and Russia, which adds a whole beautiful complexity to this whole thing. So I want to just correct that. The fascinating thing about Wikipedia is in some sense, those little details don't matter. But in another sense, what I felt when I saw a Wikipedia page about me or anybody I know, is there's this beautiful kind of saving that this person existed, like a community that notices you. It says, like a little, you see like a butterfly that floats and you're like, huh, that it's not just any butterfly. It's that one. I like that one. Or you see a puppy or something, or it's this big pen. This one, I remember this one has this scratch and you get noticed in that way. And I don't know, that's a beautiful thing. And it's, I mean, maybe it's very silly of me and naive, but I feel like Wikipedia in terms of individuals is an opportunity to celebrate people, to celebrate ideas and not a battleground of attacks of the kind of stuff we might see on Twitter, like the mockery, the derision, this kind of stuff. For sure. And of course you don't want to cherish it. Yeah. You don't want to cherry pick, all of us have flaws and so on, but it just feels like to highlight a controversy of some sort, when that doesn't at all represent the entirety of the human, in most cases, is sad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's a few things to unpack and all that. So first, one of the things I always find very interesting is your status with MIT. Okay, that's upsetting and it's an argument, but it can be sorted out. But then what's interesting is you gave as much time to that, which is actually important and relevant to your career and so on, to also where your father was born, which most people would hardly notice but is really meaningful to you. And I find that a lot when I talk to people who have a biography in Wikipedia is they're often as annoyed by a tiny error that no one's going to notice, like this town in Tajikistan has got a new name and so on, like nobody even knows what that means or whatever, but it can be super, super interesting. Yeah, super important. And so that's one of the reasons for biographies, we say, human dignity really matters. And so some of the things have to do with, and this is a common debate that goes on in Wikipedia, is what we call undue weight. So I'll give an example. There was an article I stumbled across many years ago about the mayor, or no, he wasn't a mayor, he was a city council member of, I think it was Peoria, Illinois, but some small town in the Midwest. And the entry, he's been on the city council for 30 years or whatever. He's pretty, I mean, frankly, pretty boring guy and seems like a good local city politician. But in this very short biography, there was a whole paragraph, a long paragraph about his son being arrested for DUI. And it was clearly undue weight. It's like, what does this got to do with this guy, if it even deserves a mention? It wasn't even clear, had he done anything hypocritical? Had he done himself anything wrong? Even was his son, his son got a DUI, that's never great, but it happens to people and it doesn't seem like a massive scandal for your dad. So of course, I just took that out immediately. This is a long, long time ago. And that's the sort of thing where we have to really think about in a biography and about controversies to say, is this a real controversy? So in general, one of the things we tend to say is like any section, so if there's a biography and there's a section called controversies, that's actually poor practice because it just invites people to say, oh, I want to work on this entry. Let's see, there's seven sections. Oh, this one's quite short. Can I add something? Right. Go out and find some more controversies. No, that's nonsense, right? And in general, putting it separate from everything else kind of makes it seem worse and also doesn't put it in the right context. Whereas if it's sort of a live flow and there is a controversy, there's always potential controversy for anyone, it should just be sort of worked into the overall article because then it doesn't become a temptation. You can contextualize appropriately and so forth. So that's part of the whole process. But I think for me, one of the most important things is what I call community health. So yeah, are we going to get it wrong sometimes? Yeah, of course. We're humans and doing good quality, sort of reference material is hard. The real question is how do people react to a criticism or a complaint or a concern? And if the reaction is defensiveness or combativeness back, or if someone's really sort of in there being aggressive and in the wrong, like, no, no, no, hold on. We've got to do this the right way. You got to say, okay, hold on. Are there good sources? Is this contextualized appropriately? Is it even important enough to mention? Yeah. What does it mean? And sometimes one of the areas where I do think there is a very complicated flaw, and you've alluded to it a little bit, but it's like, we know the media is deeply flawed. We know that journalism can go wrong. And I would say, particularly in the last, whatever, 15 years, we've seen a real decimation of local media, local newspapers. We've seen a real rise in clickbait headlines and sort of eager focus on anything that might be controversial. We've always had that with us, of course. There's always been tabloid newspapers. But that makes it a little bit more challenging to say, okay, how do we sort things out when we have a pretty good sense that not every source is valid? So as an example, a few years ago, it's been quite a while now, we deprecated the Mail Online as a source. Mm-hmm . And the Mail Online, the digital arm of the Daily Mail, it's a tabloid. It's not completely, it's not fake news, but it does tend to run very hyped up stories. They really love to attack people and go on the attack for political reasons and so on. And it just isn't great. And so by saying deprecated, and I think some people say, oh, you banned the Daily Mail. No, we didn't ban it as a source. We just said, look, it's probably not a great source. You should probably look for a better source. So certainly, if the Daily Mail runs a headline saying, new cure for cancer, it's like, probably there's more serious sources than a tabloid newspaper. So in an article about lung cancer, you probably wouldn't cite the Daily Mail. That's kind of ridiculous. But also for celebrities and so forth to sort of know, well, they do cover celebrity gossip a lot, but they also tend to have vendettas and so forth. And you really have to step back and go, hmm, is this really, it's like, a cyclopedic or is this just the Daily Mail going on a rant? And some of that requires a great community health. It requires massive community health. Even for me, for stuff I've seen that's kind of, if actually iffy about people I know, things I know about myself, I still feel like a love for knowledge emanating from the article. Like, I feel the community health. So I will take all slight inaccuracies. I would, I love it because that means there's people, for the most part, I feel a respect and love in this search for knowledge. Like sometimes, because I also love Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange for programming related things, and they can get a little cranky sometimes to a degree where it's like, it's not as, like you could see, you could feel the dynamics of the health of the particular community and sub communities too, like a particular, see, Sharp or Java or Python or whatever. Like there's little like communities that emerge. You can feel the levels of toxicity because a little bit of strictness is good, but a little too much is bad because of the defensiveness. Because when somebody writes an answer and then somebody else kind of says, well, modify it and it get defensive. And there's this tension that's not conducive to like improving towards a more truthful depiction of like what that topic. Yeah. A great example that I really love, I think, is this book that I wrote this morning that I saw, someone left a note on my user talk page in English Wikipedia saying, it was quite a dramatic headline, I think, "Racist hook on front page." So we have on the front page of Wikipedia, we have a little section called, "Did you know?" And it's just little tidbits and facts, just things people find interesting. And there's a whole process for how things get there. And the one that somebody was raising a question about was, it was comparing a very well-known U.S. football player, there was a quote from another famous sport person comparing him to a Lamborghini, clearly a compliment. And so somebody said, actually, here's a study, here's some interesting information about how black sports people are far more often compared to inanimate objects and given that kind of analogy. And I think it's demeaning to compare a person to a car, et cetera, et cetera. But they said, I'm not, I'm not pulling, I'm not deleting it. I'm not removing it. I just want to raise the question. And then there's this really interesting conversation that goes on where I think the general consensus was, you know what, this isn't like the alarming headline, racist thing on the front page of Wikipedia. That sounds, holy moly, that sounds bad. But it's sort of like, actually, yeah, this probably isn't the sort of analogy that we think is great. And so we should probably think about how to improve our language and not compare sports people to inanimate objects and particularly be aware of certain racial sensitivities that there might be around that sort of thing if there is a disparity in the media of how people are called. And I just thought, you know what, nothing for me to weigh in on here. This is a good conversation. Like nobody's saying, you know, people should be banned if, if they refer to, what was his name? The fridge, refrigerator Perry, the, you know, very famous comparison to an inanimate object of a Chicago Bears player many years ago. But they're just saying, hey, let's be careful about analogies that we just pick up from the media. I said, yeah, you know, that's good. On the sort of deprecation of news sources is really interesting because I think what you're saying is ultimately you want to make a article by article decision, kind of use your own judgment. And it's such a subtle thing because the, there's just a lot of hit pieces written about individuals like myself, for example, that masquerade as kind of an objective, thorough exploration of a human being. It's fascinating to watch because controversy and hit pieces just get more clicks. Oh yeah, sure. And this is, I guess as a Wikipedia contributor, you start to deeply become aware of that and start to have a sense, like a radar of clickbait versus truth. Like to, to pick out the truth from the clickbaity type language. Oh yeah. I mean, it's really important. We talk a lot about weasel words. Actually, I'm sure we'll end up talking about AI and ChatGPT, but just to quickly mention, in this area I think one of the potentially powerful tools, because it is quite good at this. I've played around with and practiced it quite a lot. But ChatGPT 4 is really quite able to take a passage and point out potentially biased terms, to rewrite it to be more neutral. Now, it is a bit anodyne and it's a bit cliched. So sometimes it just takes the spirit out of something that's actually not bad. It's just like poetic language and you're like, "Okay, that's not actually helping." Yeah. But in many cases, I think that sort of thing is quite interesting. And I'm also interested in, can you imagine where you feed in a Wikipedia entry and all the sources and you say, "Help me find anything in the article that is not accurately reflecting what's in the sources." And that doesn't have to be perfect. It only has to be good enough to be useful to a community. So if it scans an article and all that, it's going to be good enough to be useful. And then you look at all the sources and you say, "Oh, it came back with 10 suggestions, and seven of them were decent and three of them it just didn't understand. Well, actually, that's probably worth my time to do." And it can help us really more quickly get good people to sort of review obscure entries and things like that. So just as a small aside on that, and we'll probably talk about language models a little bit or a lot more, but one of the articles, which is a really good one, is called "The Language Model of the World." And it's a really good one. One of the hit pieces about me, the journalist actually was very straightforward and honest about having used GPT to write part of the article. Oh, interesting. And then finding that it made an error and apologized for the error that GPT-4 generated, which has this kind of interesting loop, which is the articles are used to write Wikipedia pages, GPT is trained on Wikipedia. And there's like this interesting loop where the weasel word, and the nuances can get lost or can propagate even though they're not grounded in reality. Somehow, in the generation of the language model, new truths can be created and kind of linger. Yeah, there's a famous webcomic that's titled "Cytogenesis," which is about how something, an error's in Wikipedia and there's no source for it, but then a lazy journalist reads it and writes the source. And then some helpful Wikipedian spots that it has no source, finds the source and adds it to Wikipedia. And voila, magic. This happened to me once. It, well, it nearly happened. There was this, I mean, it was really brief. I went back and researched it. I'm like, "This is really odd." So Biography Magazine, which is a magazine published by the Biography TV channel, had a profile of me and it said, in his spare time, I'm not quoting a lot of people, but I'm not quoting a lot of people. I'm not quoting a lot of people. I'm not quoting a lot of people. I'm not quoting a lot of people. I'm not quoting a lot of people. I'm not quoting a lot of people. I'm not quoting a lot of people. I'm not quoting a lot of people. I'm not quoting a lot of people. Exactly. It's been many years. But in his spare time, he enjoys playing chess with friends. I thought, "Wow, that sounds great. I would like to be that guy." But actually, I mean, I play chess with my kids sometimes, but no, it's not a hobby of mine. And I was like, "Where did they get that?" And I contacted the magazine. I said, "Where did that come from?" They said, "Oh, it was in Wikipedia." And I looked in the history. There had been vandalism of Wikipedia, which is not damaging. It's just false. And it had already been removed. But then I thought, "Oh, gosh, well, I better mention this to people because otherwise, somebody's going to read that and they're going to add it to the entry and it's going to take on a life of its own." And then sometimes I wonder if it has because I was invited a few years ago to do the ceremonial first move in the World Chess Championship. And I thought, "I wonder if they think I'm a really big chess enthusiast because they read this biography magazine article." But that problem, when we think about large language models and the ability to quickly generate very plausible but not true content, I think is something that there's going to be a lot of shakeout, a lot of implications of that. What would be hilarious is because of the social pressure of Wikipedia and the momentum, you would actually start playing a lot more chess. Not only the articles are written based on Wikipedia, but your own life trajectory changes because of that. Yeah. And that's the thing about Wikipedia, just to make it more convenient. Yeah. Aspire to. Aspire to, yeah. Yeah. It's aspirational. If we could just talk about that before we jump back to some other interesting topics on Wikipedia. Let's talk about GPT-4 and large language models. So they are in part trained on Wikipedia content. Yeah. What are the pros and cons of these language models? What are your thoughts? Yeah. So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on. Obviously, the tech industry is a big part of that. Yeah. So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on. Obviously, the tech industry is a big part of that. Yeah. So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on. Obviously, the tech industry is a big part of that. Yeah. So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on. Obviously, the technology has moved very quickly in the last six months and looks poised to do so for some time to come. So, first things first, I mean, part of our philosophy is the open licensing, the free licensing, the idea that, you know, this is what we're here for. We are a volunteer community and we write this encyclopedia. We give it to the world to do what you like with. Yeah. Yeah. You can modify it, redistribute it, redistribute modified versions, commercially, non-commercially. This is the licensing. So, in that sense, of course, it's completely fine. Now, we do worry a bit about attribution because it is a Creative Commons attribution share-like license. So, attribution is important, not just because of our licensing model and things like that, but it's just proper attribution is just good intellectual practice. And so, and that's a really hard, complicated question. You know, if I were to write something about my visit here, I might say in a blog post, you know, I was in Austin, which is a city in Texas. I'm not going to put a source for Austin as a city in Texas. That's just general knowledge. I learned it somewhere. I can't tell you where. So, you don't have to cite and reference every single thing. But, you know, if I actually did research and I used something very heavily, it's just proper, morally proper. So, I'm not going to put a source for Austin. I'm not going to put a source for Austin. I'm not going to put a source for Austin. Morally proper to give your sources. So, we would like to see that. And obviously, you know, they call it grounding. So, particularly people at Google are really keen on figuring out grounding. That's such a cool term. So, any text that's generated, trying to ground it to the Wikipedia quality source. I mean, like the same kind of standard of what a source means that Wikipedia uses, the same kind of source will be generated. Yeah. The same kind of thing. And of course, one of the biggest flaws in ChatGPD right now is that it just literally will make things up just to be amiable. I think it's programmed to be very helpful and amiable. And it doesn't really know or care about the truth. You can get bullied into, it can kind of be convinced into. Well, but like this morning, the story I was telling earlier about comparing a football player to a Lamborghini. And I thought, well, is that really rare? And I was like, well, I'm not sure. I don't know. But I'm just, I'm mulling it over. And I thought, I'm going to go to ChatGPD. So, I sent to ChatGPD4, I said, you know, this happened in Wikipedia. Can you think of examples where a white athlete has been compared to a fast car inanimate object? And it comes back with a very plausible essay where it tells, you know, why these analogies are common in sport. I said, no, no, I really, could you give me some specific examples? So, I said, well, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It gives me three specific examples, very plausible, correct names of athletes and contemporaries and all of that. Could have been true. Googled every single quote and none of them existed. And so, I'm like, well, that's really not good. Like, I wanted to explore a thought process I was in. I thought, first, I thought, how do I Google? And it's like, well, it's kind of a hard thing to Google because unless somebody's written about this specific topic, it's, you know, it's a large language model. It's processed all this data. It can probably piece that together for me. But it just can't yet. So, I think, I hope that chat GPT-5, 6, 7, you know, 3 to 5 years, I'm hoping we'll see a much higher, you know, level of accuracy where when you ask a question like that, I think instead of being quite so eager to please by giving you a plausible sounding answer, it's just like, don't know. Or maybe display the how much bullshit might be in this generated text. Like, I really would like to make you happy right now, but I'm really stretched thin with this generation. Well, it's one of the things I've said for a long time. So, in Wikipedia, one of the great things we do may not be great for our reputation, except in a deeper sense for the long term, I think it is. But, you know, we'll all be on notice that says, "The neutrality of this section has been disputed," or "The following section doesn't cite any sources." And I always joke, you know, sometimes I wish the New York Times would run a banner saying, "The neutrality of this has been disputed." They could give us an, "We had a big fight in the newsroom as to whether to run this or not, but we thought it's important enough to bring it to you. But just be aware that not all the journalists are on board with it." "Oh, that's actually interesting, and that's fine." I would trust them more for that level of transparency. So, yeah, similarly, chat GPT should say, "Yeah, 87% bullshit." Well, the neutrality one is really interesting, because that's basically a summary of the discussions that are going on underneath. It would be amazing if, like, I should be honest, I don't look at the talk page often. I don't, it would be nice somehow if there was a kind of a summary in this banner way of like, "This, lots of wars have been fought on this here land for this here paragraph." It's really interesting, yeah. I hadn't thought of that. Because one of the things I do spend a lot of time thinking about these days, and, you know, people have found it, we're moving slowly, but, you know, we are moving, thinking about, okay, these tools exist. Are there ways that this stuff can be useful to our community? Because a part of it is, we do approach things in a non-commercial way, in a really deep sense. It's like, it's been great that Wikipedia's become very popular, but really, we're just, we're a community whose hobby is writing an encyclopedia. That's first. And if it's popular, great. If it's not, okay, we might have trouble paying for more servers, but it'll be fine. And so, how do we help the community use these tools? What are the ways that these tools can support people? And one example I never thought about, I'm going to start playing with it, is, you know, feed in the article and feed in the talk page, and say, "Can you suggest some warnings in the article based on the conversations on the talk page?" I think it's really important. Yeah. I think it's important. I think it's important. I think it's brilliant. I think it might be good at that. It might get it wrong sometimes, but again, if it's reasonably successful at doing that, and you can say, "Oh, actually, yeah, it does suggest, you know, the neutrality of this has been disputed on a section that has a seven-page discussion in the back," that might be useful. I don't know. We're playing with it. I mean, some more color to the, not neutrality, but also the amount of emotion laden in the article. Yeah. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. Yeah. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. Yeah. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. Yeah. It might actually help you look at more controversial pages, like on, you know, a page on the war in Ukraine or a page on Israel and Palestine. There could be parts that everyone agrees on, and there's parts that are just like- Tough. Tough. The hard parts, yeah. And it would be nice to, when looking at those beautiful long articles, to know, like, all right, let me just take in some stuff where everybody agrees on. Well, I can give an example that I haven't looked at in a long time, but I was really pleased with what I saw at the time. So, the discussion was that they're building something in Israel, and for their own political reasons, one side calls it a wall, hearkening back to Berlin Wall apartheid, the other calls it a security fence. So, we can understand, quite quickly, if we give it a moment's thought, we're like, okay, I understand why people would have this grappling over the language. Like, okay, you want to highlight the negative aspects of this, and you want to highlight the positive aspects, so you're going to try and choose a different name. And so, there was this really fantastic Wikipedia discussion on the talk page, how do we word that paragraph to talk about the different naming? It's called this by Israelis, it's called this by Palestinians. And how you explain that to people could be quite charged, right? You could easily- Explain, oh, there's this difference, and it's because this side's good and this side's bad, and that's why there's a difference. Or you could say, actually, let's just, let's try and really stay as neutral as we can and try to explain the reasons. So, you may come away from it with a concept. Oh, okay, I understand what this debate is about now. And just the term, Israel-Palestine conflict, is still the title of a page. It's Wikipedia. But the word conflict is something that is a charged word. Of course, yeah. Because from the Palestinian side or from certain sides, the word conflict doesn't accurately describe the situation, because if you see it as a genocide, one-way genocide, it's not a conflict, because to that, to people that discuss, that challenge the word conflict, they see, you know, conflict is when there's two equally powerful sides fighting. Yeah, yeah. No, it's hard. And, you know, in a number of cases, so this actually speaks to a slightly broader phenomenon, which is there are a number of cases where there is no one word that can get consensus. And in the body of an article, that's usually okay, because we can explain the whole thing. You can come away with an understanding of why each side wants to use a certain word. But there are some aspects, like the page has to have a title. So, you know, there's that. Same thing with certain things like photos, you know, it's like, well, there's different photos, which one's best? A lot of different views on that. But at the end of the day, you need the lead photo, because there's one slot for a lead photo. Categories is another one. So, at one point, I have no idea if it's in there today, but I don't think so. I was listed in, you know, American entrepreneurs, fine, American Atheists. And I said, "Hmm, that doesn't feel right to me." Like, just personally, it's true. I mean, I wouldn't disagree with the objective fact of it. But when you click the category and you see sort of a lot of people who are, you might say, American Atheist activists, because that's their big issue. So, Madeline Murray O'Hare or various famous people who, Richard Dawkins, who make it a big part of their public argument and persona. But that's not true of me. It's just like my private personal belief. It doesn't really matter. But I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. And I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. It's not something I campaign about. So, it felt weird to put me in the category, but what category would you put, you know? And do you need that? In this case, I argued, "That doesn't need that." Like, that's not, I don't speak about it publicly, except incidentally from time to time. I don't campaign about it. So, it's weird to put me with this group of people. And that argument carried the day. I hope not just because it was me. But categories can be like that, where you're either in the category or you're not. And sometimes it's a lot more complicated than that. And is it, again, we go back to, is it undue weight? If someone who is now prominent in public life and generally considered to be a good person was convicted of something, let's say DUI, when they were young, normally in normal sort of discourse, we don't think, "Oh, this person should be in the category of American criminals." Because you think, "Oh, criminal, yeah, technically speaking, it's against the law to drive under the influence of alcohol, and you were arrested, and you spent a month in prison or whatever." But it's odd to say that's a criminal. So, just as an example in this area is Mark Wahlberg, Marky Mark, that's what I always think of him as, because that was his first sort of famous name, who I wouldn't think should be listed as in the category American criminal, even though he did, he was convicted of quite a bad crime when he was a young man. But he was convicted of a crime when he was a young man. And he was a young person, but we don't think of him as a criminal. Should the entry talk about that? Yeah, it's actually, that's actually an important part of his life story, that he had a very rough youth and he could have gone down a really dark path and he turned his life around. That's actually interesting. So, categories are tricky. - Especially with people, because we like to assign labels to people and to ideas somehow, and those labels stick. - Yeah. - And there's certain words that have a lot of power, like criminal, like political, left, right, center, anarchist, objectivist, what other philosophies are there? Marxist, communist, social democrat, democratic socialist, socialist. And if you add that as a category, all of a sudden it's like, oh boy, you're that guy now. And I don't know if you want to be that guy. - Well, there's definitely some really charged ones, like alt-right, I think is quite a complicated entire category. - Yeah. - I mean, it's not a completely meaningless label, but boy, I think you really have to pause before you actually put that label on someone, partly because now you're putting them in a group of people, some of whom are quite, you wouldn't want to be grouped with. So it's, yeah. - Let's go into some, you mentioned the hot water of the pool that we're both tipping a toe in. Do you think Wikipedia has a left-leaning political bias, which is something it is sometimes accused of? - Yeah, so I don't think so. Not, broadly. And I think you can always point to specific entries and talk about specific biases, but that's part of the process of Wikipedia. Anyone can come and challenge and to go on about that. But I see fairly often on Twitter, some sort of quite extreme accusations of bias. And I think, actually, I just, I don't see it. I don't buy that. And if you ask people for an example, they normally struggle, and depending on who they are and what it's about. So it's certainly true that some people who have quite fringe viewpoints, and who knows, the full rush of history in 500 years, they might be considered to be pathbreaking geniuses, but at the moment, quite fringe views. And they're just unhappy that Wikipedia doesn't report on their fringe views as being mainstream. And so I think that's a good example of that. And that, by the way, goes across all kinds of fields. I mean, I was once accosted on the street outside the TED conference in Vancouver by a guy who's a homeopath, who was very upset that Wikipedia's entry on homeopathy basically says it's pseudoscience. And he felt that was biased. And I said, "Well, I can't really help you because, you know, it cites, we cite good quality sources to talk about the scientific status, and it's not very good." So, you know, it depends. And, you know, I think it's something that we should always be vigilant about. But it's, you know, in general, I think we're pretty good. And I think any time you go to any serious political controversy, we should have a pretty balanced perspective on who's saying what, what the views are, and so forth. I would actually argue that the areas where we are more likely to have bias are the areas where we are more likely to have bias. And I think that's the thing that's really important. And I think that's the thing that's really important. And I think that's the thing that's really important. And I think that's the thing that's really important. And I think that's the thing that's really important. for a long period of time are actually fairly obscure things, or maybe fairly non-political things. I always give, it's kind of a humorous example, but it's meaningful. If you read our entries about Japanese anime, they tend to be very, very positive and very favorable, because almost no one knows about Japanese anime except for fans. And so the people who come and spend their days writing Japanese anime articles, they love it. They kind of have an inherent love for the whole area. Now, of course, being human beings, they'll have their internal debates and disputes about what's better or not. But in general, they're quite positive, because nobody actually cares. And anything that people are quite passionate about, then hopefully, there's quite a lot of interesting stuff. So I'll give an example, a contemporary example, where I think we've done a good job as of my most recent sort of look at it. And that is the question about the efficacy of masks. During the COVID pandemic. And that's an area where I would say the public authorities really kind of jerked us all around a bit. In the very first days, they said, "Whatever you do, don't rush on and buy masks." And their concern was shortages in hospitals. Okay, fair enough. Later, it's like, "No, everybody's got to wear a mask everywhere. It really works really well." Then now, I think it's the evidence is mixed, right? Masks seem to help, in my personal view, masks seem to help. They're no huge burden. You might as well wear a mask in any environment where you're with a giant crowd of people and so forth. But it's very politicized, that one. It's very politicized where certainly in the US, much more so. I mean, I live in the UK, I live in London. I've never seen on the streets the kind of thing that there's a lot of reports of people actively angry because someone else is angry. And I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. That sort of thing in public. And so, because it became very politicized, then clearly, if you go to Wikipedia and you research this topic, I think you'll find more or less what I've just said. I'm like, "Actually, after it's all to this point in history, it's mixed evidence. Masks seem to help, but maybe not as much as some of the authorities said, and here we are." And that's kind of an example where I think, "Okay, we've done a good job, but I suspect there are people on both sides of that very emotional debate who think this is ridiculous. Hopefully, we've got quality sources, so then hopefully those people who read this can say, 'Oh, actually, you know, it is complicated.'" You know, if you can get to the point of saying, "Okay, I have my view, but I understand other views, and I do think it's a complicated question," great. Now we're a little bit more mature as a society. Well, that one is an interesting one because I feel like I hope that that article also contains the meta-conversation about the politicization of that topic. To me, it's almost more interesting than whether masks work or not, at least at this point. It's like why masks became a symbol of the oppression of a centralized government, if you wear them. You're a sheep that follows the mask control, the mass hysteria of an authoritarian regime. And if you don't wear a mask, then you're a science denier, anti-vaccine. Exactly. And that whole politicization of society is just so damaging. And I don't know, in the broader world, how do we start to fix that? That's a really hard question. Well, at every moment, because you mentioned mainstream and fringe, there seems to be a tension here, and I wonder what your philosophy is on it. Yeah. Because there's mainstream ideas and there's fringe ideas. You look at lab leak theory for this virus. There could be other things we can discuss where there's a mainstream narrative where if you just look at the percent of the population or the population with platforms, what they say, and then what is a small percentage in opposition to that, and what is Wikipedia's responsibility to accurately represent both the mainstream and the fringe, do you think? Yeah. Well, I mean, I think we have to try to do our best to recognize both, but also to appropriately contextualize. And so this can be quite hard, particularly when emotions are high. That's just a fact about human beings. I'll give a simpler example because there's not a lot of emotion around it. Our entry on the moon doesn't say, "Some say the moon's made of rocks. Some say cheese." You know? Some say, "The moon's made of rocks. Some say cheese." You know? Who knows? That kind of false neutrality is not what we want to get to. That doesn't make any sense. But that one's easy. We all understand. I think there is a Wikipedia entry called something like "The moon is made of cheese," where it talks about this is a common sort of joke or thing that children say or that people tell to children or whatever. It's just a thing. Everybody's heard, "The moon's made of cheese." But nobody thinks, "Wow, Wikipedia is so one-sided, it doesn't even acknowledge the cheese theory." I'd say the same thing about flat earth, you know? Again, very— That's exactly what I'm looking up right now. Very little controversy. We will have an entry about flat earth theorizing, flat earth people. My personal view is most of the people who claim to be flat earthers are just having a laugh, trolling, and more power to them. Have some fun, but let's not be— Yeah. —you know, ridiculous. Of course, for most of human history, people believe that the earth is flat. So the article I'm looking at is actually kind of focusing on this history. "Flat earth is an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of the earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribe to flat earth cosmography with pretty cool pictures of what a flat earth would look like." With dragon—is that dragon? No, angels on the edge. There's a lot of controversy about that. What is on the edge? Is it the wall? Is it angels? Is it dragons? Yeah. Yeah. Is there a dome? And how can you fly from South Africa to Perth? Because on a flat earth view, that's really too far for any plane to make it. It's all spread out. What I want to know is what's on the other side, Jimmy? What's on the other side? That's what all of us want to know. Yeah. So there's some—I presume there's probably a small section about the conspiracy theory of flat earth, because I think there's a sizable percent of the population who at least, at least, will say they believe in a flat earth. I think it is a movement that just says that the mainstream narrative—to have distrust and skepticism about the mainstream narrative, which to a very small degree is probably a very productive thing to do. It's part of the scientific process, but you can get a little silly and ridiculous with it. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's exactly right. And so, you know, I think I find on many, many cases, and, of course, I, like anybody else, might quibble about this or that in any Wikipedia article, but in general, I think there is a pretty good sort of willingness and, indeed, eagerness to say, "Oh, let's fairly represent all of the meaningfully important sides." So there's still a lot to unpack in that, right? So meaningfully important. So, you know, people who are raising questions about the question of flat earth, they're not necessarily the ones who are going to say, "Well, let's have a discussion about the efficacy of masks." Okay, that's actually a reasonable thing to have a discussion about, and hopefully we should treat that as a fair conversation to have and actually address which authorities have said what and so on and so forth. And then, you know, there are other cases where it's not meaningful opposition, you know? Like, you just wouldn't say—I mean, I doubt if the main article, Moon, it may mention, geez, probably not even because it's not credible and it's not even meant to be serious by anyone. Or the article on the Earth certainly won't have a paragraph that says, "Well, most scientists think it's round, but certain people think flat." Like, that's just a silly thing to put in that article. You would want to sort of address, you know, that's an interesting cultural phenomenon. You want to put it somewhere. So this goes into all kinds of things about politics. You want to be really careful, really thoughtful about not getting caught up in the anger of our times, and really recognize. You know, so I always thought—I remember being really kind of proud of the US at the time when it was McCain was running against Obama, because I thought, "Oh, I've got plenty of disagreements with both of them." But they both seem like thoughtful and interesting people who I would have different disagreements with, but I always felt like, "Yeah, that's good. That's good." And I always felt like, "Yeah, that's good. That's good." Now we can have a debate. Now we can have an interesting debate, and it isn't just sort of people slamming each other, personal attacks, and so forth. And you're saying Wikipedia also represented that? I hope so. Yeah. And I think so, in the main. Obviously, you can always find debate that went horribly wrong, because there's humans involved. But speaking of those humans, I would venture to guess—I don't know the data, maybe you can let me know—but the personal political leaning of the group of people who edit Wikipedia probably leans left, I would guess. So to me, the question there is—I mean, the same is true for Silicon Valley. The task for Silicon Valley is to create platforms that are not politically biased, even though there is a bias for the engineers who create it. And I believe it's possible to do that. There's kind of conspiracy theories that it somehow is impossible, and there's this whole conspiracy where the left is controlling it and so on. I think engineers, for the most part, want to create platforms that are open and unbiased, that create all kinds of perspective, because that's super exciting to have all kinds of perspectives, battle it out. But still, is there a degree to which the personal political bias of the editors might seep in, in silly ways and in big ways? Silly ways could be, I think, hopefully I'm correct in saying this, but— Yeah. —the right will call it the Democrat Party, and the left will call it the Democratic Party. Mm. Right? Yeah. Like subtle—it always hits my ear weird, like, are we children here? We're literally taking words and just jabbing at each other. Like, yeah, I could capitalize a thing in a certain way, or I can just take a word and mess with them. That's a small way of how you use words. But you can also have a bigger way about beliefs, about various perspectives on political events, on Hunter Biden's laptop, on how big of a story that is or not, how big the censorship of that story is or not, that kind of—and then there's these camps that take very strong points, and they construct big narratives around that. And I mean, it's very sizable percent of the population believes the two narratives that compete with each other. Yeah. I mean, it's really interesting. And it feels—it's hard to judge, you know, the sweep of history within your own lifetime. Sure. Yeah. But it feels like it's gotten much worse. Yes. That this idea of two parallel universes where people can agree on certain basic facts feels worse than it used to be. And I'm not sure if that's true, or if it just feels that way, but I also am not sure what the cause is or are. I think I would lay a lot of the blame in recent years on social media algorithms, which reward clickbait headlines, which reward tweets that go viral, and they go viral because they're cute and clever. I mean, my most successful tweet ever, by a fairly wide margin, some reporter tweeted a tweet at Elon Musk because he was complaining about Wikipedia or something, "You should buy Wikipedia," and I just wrote, "Not for sale." Nice. And, you know, 90 zillion retweets, and people liked it, and it was all very good. But I'm like, "You know what? It's a cute line, right? And it's a good mic drop and all that." And I was pleased with myself. It's not really discourse. It's not really what I like to do, but it's what social media really does. It's what social media really rewards, which is kind of a, lets you and him have a fight, right? And that's more interesting. I mean, it's funny because at the time I was texting with Elon, who was very pleasant to me and all of that. He might have been a little bit shitty. The reporter might have been a little bit shitty, but you fed into the shitty with a snarky, funny response, "Not for sale." Yeah. And like, where do you, like, what? So that's a funny little exchange, and you could probably, after that, laugh it off, and it's fun. But like, that kind of mechanism that rewards the snark, Yeah. can go into viciousness. Yeah, yeah. Well, and we certainly see it online. You know, like, a series of tweets, you know, sort of a tweet thread of 15 tweets that assesses the quality of the evidence for masks, pros and cons, and sort of where this, that's not going to go viral, you know? But, you know, a smackdown for a famous politician who was famously in favor of masks, who also went to a dinner and didn't wear a mask, that's going to go viral. And, you know, that's partly human nature. You know, people love to call out hypocrisy and all of that, but it's partly what these systems elevate automatically. I talk about this with respect to Facebook, for example. So I think Facebook has done a pretty good job, although it's taken longer than it should in some cases. But, you know, if you have a very large following and you're really spouting hatred, hatred or misinformation, disinformation, they've kicked people off. They've done, you know, some reasonable things there. But actually, the deeper issue is of this, the anger we're talking about, of the contentiousness of everything. I make a family example with two great stereotypes. So one, the crackpot racist uncle, and one, the sweet grandma. And I always want to point out about all of my uncles in my family were wonderful people, so I didn't have a crackpot racist. But everybody knows the stereotype. Yes. Well, so grandma, she just posts like sweet comments on the kids' pictures and congratulates people on their wedding anniversary. And crackpot uncle's posting his nonsense. And normally, it's sort of at Christmas dinner, everybody rolls their eyes, "Oh yeah, Uncle Frank's here. He's probably going to say some racist comment, and we're going to tell him to shut up," or, you know, "Maybe let's not invite him this year." You know, the normal human drama. He's got his three mates down at the pub who listen to him and all of that. But now, grandma's got, you know, 54 followers on Facebook, which is the intimate family, and racist uncle has 714. So he's not a massive influence or whatever. But how did that happen? It's because the algorithm notices, "Oh, when she posts, nothing happens. He posts, and then everybody jumps in to go, 'God, shut up, Uncle Frank.' You know, like, that's outrageous." And it's like, "Oh, there's engagement." And then, you know, you're like, "Oh, there's engagement." There's page views, there's ads, right? And those algorithms, I think they're working to improve that. But it's really hard for them. It's hard to improve that if that actually is working. If the people who are saying things that get engagement, if it's not too awful, but it's just, you know, like, maybe it's not a racist uncle, but maybe it's an uncle who posts a lot about what an idiot Biden is, right? Which isn't necessarily an offensive or blockable or bannable thing, and it shouldn't be. But if that's the deal, then it's not a racist uncle. And if it's not a racist uncle, then it's not a racist uncle. And if it's not a racist uncle, then it's not a racist uncle. And discourse that gets elevated because it gets a rise out of people, then suddenly in a society, it's like, "Oh, this is, we get more of what we reward." So I think that's a piece of what's going on. Well, if we could just take that tangent. I'm having a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg a second time. Is there something you can comment on how to decrease toxicity on that particular platform, Facebook? You also have worked on creating a social network that is less toxic yourself. Yeah. So can we just talk about, you know, what's the best way to do that? Can we talk about the different ideas that these already big social networks can do and what you have been trying to do? So a piece of it is, it's hard. So I don't, the problem with making a recommendation to Facebook is that I actually believe their business model makes it really hard for them. And I'm not anti-capitalism. I'm not, you know, great. Somebody's got business, they're making money. That's not, that's not where I come from. But certain business models mean, you are going to prioritize things that maybe aren't that long-term helpful. And so that's a big piece of it. So certainly for Facebook, you could say, you know, with vast resources, start to prioritize content that's higher quality, that's healing, that's kind. Try not to prioritize content that seems to be just getting a rise out of people. Now, those are vague human descriptions, right? But I do believe good machine running algorithms, you can optimize in slightly different ways. But to do that, you may have to say, actually, we're not necessarily going to increase page views to the maximum extent right now. And I've said this to people at Facebook. It's like, you know, if your actions are, you know, convincing people that you're breaking Western civilization, that's really bad for business in the long run. Certainly these days, I'll say, Twitter is the thing that's on people's minds as being more upsetting at the moment. But I think it's true. And so one of the things that's really interesting about Facebook, compared to a lot of companies, is that Mark has a pretty unprecedented amount of power. His ability to name members of the board, his control of the company is pretty hard to break, even if financial results aren't as good as they could be because he's taken a step back from the perfect optimization to say, actually, for the long-term health in the next 50 years of this organization, we need to rein in some of the things that are working for us and making money because they're actually giving us a bad reputation. So one of the recommendations I would say is, and this is not to do with the algorithms and all that, but how about just a moratorium on all political advertising? I don't think it's their most profitable segment, but it's given rise to a lot of deep, hard questions about dark money, about ads that are run by questionable people that push false narratives. Or the classic kind of thing is, I saw a study about Brexit in the UK, where people were talking about there were ads run to animal rights activists saying, "Finally, when we're out from the market, we're going to be able to get a lot of money out of the market." And they're saying, "Well, we're out from under Europe, the UK can pass proper animal rights legislation. We're not constrained by the European process." Similarly for people who are advocates of fox hunting, to say, "Finally, when we're out of Europe, we can reimplement." So you're telling people what they want to hear. And in some cases, it's really hard for journalists to see that. So it used to be that for political advertising, you really needed to find some kind of mainstream narrative. And this is still true to an extent. Mainstream narrative that 60% of people can say, "Oh, I can buy into that," which meant it pushed you to the center. It pushed you to sort of try and find some nuanced balance. But if your main method of recruiting people is a tiny little one-on-one conversation with them, because you're able to target using targeted advertising, suddenly you don't need consistent, you just need a really good targeting operation, really good Cambridge Analytica. Yeah. Style machine learning algorithm data to convince people. And that just feels really problematic. So I mean, until they can think about how to solve that problem, I would just say, "You know what? It's going to cost us X amount, but it's going to be worth it to kind of say, 'You know what? We actually think our political advertising policy hasn't really helped contribute to discourse and dialogue and finding reasoned middle ground and compromise solutions. So let's just not do that for a while until we figure that out.'" So that's maybe a piece of advice I'd give. And coupled with, as you were saying, recommender systems for the news feed and other contexts that don't always optimize engagement, but optimize the long-term mental well-being and balance and growth of a human being. Yeah. That's a very difficult problem. It's a difficult problem. Yeah. And so with WT Social, Wikitree and Social, we're launching in a few months' time a completely new system, new domain name, new lots of things. But the idea is to say, "Let's focus on trust. People can rate each other as trustworthy, rate content as trustworthy. You have to start from somewhere. So we'll start with a core base of our tiny community who I think are sensible, thoughtful people. We want to recruit more." But to say, "You know what? Actually, let's have that as a pretty strong element to say, 'Let's not optimize based on what gets the most page views in this session, let's optimize on what the feedback from people is. This is meaningfully enhancing my life.'" And so part of that is, and it's probably not a good business model, but part of that is, "Okay, we're not going to pursue an advertising business model, but a membership model where you don't have to be a member, but you can pay to be a member. You maybe get some benefit from that." But in general, to say, "Actually, the problem with..." And actually, the division I would say is, and the analogy I would give is, broadcast television funded by advertising gives you a different result than paying for HBO, paying for Netflix, paying for whatever. And the reason is, if you think about it, what is your incentive as a TV producer? You're going to make a comedy for ABC network in the US, you basically say, "I want something that almost everybody will like and listen to." So it tends to be a little blander, family friendly, whatever. Whereas if you say, "Oh, actually, I'm going to use the HBO example and an old example." You say, "You know what? Sopranos isn't for everybody. Sex and the City isn't for everybody. But between the two shows, we've got something for everybody that they're willing to pay for." So you can get edgier, higher quality, in my view, content rather than saying, "It's got to not offend anybody in the world. It's got to be for everybody." Which is really hard. So same thing here in a social network, if your business model is advertising, it's going to drive you in one direction. If your business model is membership, I think it drives you in a different direction. And I said this to Elon about Twitter Blue, which I think wasn't rolled out well and so forth. But it's like, "Hmm." The piece of that that I like is to say, "Look, actually, if there's a model where your revenue is coming from people who are willing to pay for the service, even if it's only part of your revenue, if it's a substantial part, that does change your broader incentives to say, "Actually, are people going to be willing to pay for something that's actually just toxicity in their lives?" Now, I'm not sure it's been rolled out well. I'm not sure how it's going. And maybe I'm wrong about that as a plausible business model. But I do think it's interesting to think about, just in broad terms, how this model drives outcomes in sometimes surprising ways, unless you really pause to think about it. So if we can just link on Twitter and Elon, before I would love to talk to you about the underlying business model, Wikipedia, which is this brilliant, bold move at the very beginning. But since you mentioned Twitter, what do you think works? What do you think is broken about Twitter? Oof. I mean, it's a long conversation. But to start with, one of the things that I always say is, it's a really hard problem. So I concede that right up front. I said this about the old ownership of Twitter and the new ownership of Twitter. Because unlike Wikipedia, and this is true actually for all social media, there's a box. And the box basically says, "What do you think? What's on your mind?" You can write whatever the hell you want, right? This is true, by the way, even for YouTube. I mean, the box is to upload a video. But again, it's just like an open-ended invitation to express yourself. And what makes that hard is some people have really toxic, really bad, you know, some people are very aggressive. They're actually stalking. They're actually, you know, abusive. And suddenly you deal with a lot of problems. Whereas at Wikipedia, there is no box that says, "What's on your mind?" There's a box that says, "This is an entry about the moon. Please be neutral. Please cite your facts." Then there's a talk page, which is not coming rant about Donald Trump. If you go on the talk page of the Donald Trump entry and you just start ranting about Donald Trump, people will say, "What are you doing? Stop doing that. We're not here to discuss." There's a whole world of the internet out there for you to go and rant about Donald Trump. It's just not fun to do on Wikipedia. Somehow it's fun on Twitter. Well, also, on Wikipedia, people are going to say, "Stop." And actually, "Are you here to tell us how can we improve the article, or are you just here to rant about Trump?" Because that's not actually interesting. So because the goal is different, so that's just admitting and saying upfront, "This is a hard problem." Certainly, I'm writing a book on trust. So the idea is, in the last 20 years, we've lost trust in all kinds of institutions and politics. The Edelman Trust Barometer Survey has been done for a long time. And trust in politicians, trust in journalism, it's declined substantially, and I think, in many cases, deservedly. So how do we restore trust, and how do we think about that? And does that also include trust in the idea of truth? Trust in the idea of truth. Even the concept of facts and truth is really, really important. And the idea of uncomfortable truths is really important. So when we look at Twitter, and we say, we can see, "Okay, this is really hard." So here's my story about Twitter. It's a two-part story. And it's all pre-Elon Musk ownership. So many years back, somebody accused me of horrible crimes on Twitter. And like anybody would, I was like, "I'm in the public eye. People say bad things. I don't really... I brush it off, whatever." But I'm like, "This is actually really bad. Accusing me of pedophilia, that's just not okay." So I thought, "I'm going to report this." So I click report, and I report the tweet, and there's five others. And I go through the process, and then I get an email that says, "I'm going to report this." And I go through the process, and then I get an email that says, whatever, a couple hours later saying, "Thank you for your report. We're looking into this." Great. Okay, good. Then several hours further, I get an email back saying, "Sorry, we don't see anything here to violate our terms of use." And I'm like, "Okay." So I email Jack, and I say, "Jack, come on. This is ridiculous." And he emails back roughly saying, "Yeah, sorry, Jimmy. Don't worry. We'll sort this out." And I just thought to myself, "You know what? That's not the point, right? I'm Jimmy Wales. I know Jack Dorsey. I can email Jack Dorsey. He'll listen to me because he's got an email from me and sorts it out for me. What about the teenager who's being bullied and is getting abuse and getting accusations that aren't true? Are they getting the same kind of really poor result in that case?" So fast forward a few years, same thing happens. The exact quote, I'll go, "Please help me. I'm only 10 years old, and Jimmy Wales raped me last week." It's like, "Come on. Fuck off. That's ridiculous." So I report. I'm like, "This time I'm reporting, but I'm thinking, well, we'll see what happens." This one gets even worse because then I get the same result, email back saying, "Sorry, we don't see any problems." So I raise it with other members of the board who I know and Jack. This is really ridiculous. This is outrageous. And some of the board members, friends of mine, sympathetic and so good for them, but actually got an email back then from the general counsel, head of the board, and said, "You know what? I'm not going to report on this. I'm going to report on this." And I was like, "Well, I'm not going to report on this." And I was like, "Well, I'm not going to report on this." And I was like, "Well, I'm not going to report on this." And I was like, "Well, I'm not going to report on this." And I was like, "Well, actually, there's nothing in this tweet that violates our terms of service. We don't regard and gave reference to the Me Too movement. If we didn't allow accusations, the Me Too movement, it's an important thing." And I was like, "You know what? Actually, if someone says I'm 10 years old and someone raped me last week, I think the advice should be, here's the phone number of the police. Like, you need to get the police involved. Twitter's not the place for that accusation." So even back then, by the way, they did delete those tweets, but I mean, the rationale they gave is spammy behavior. So completely separate from abusing me, it was just like, "Oh, well, they were retweeting too often. Okay, whatever." So that's just broken. That's a system that it's not working for people in the public eye. I'm sure it's not working for private people who get abuse. Really horrible abuse can happen. So how is that today? Well, it hasn't happened to me since Elon took over, but I don't see why. I don't see why it couldn't. And I suspect now if I send a report and email someone, there's no one there to email me back because he's gotten rid of a lot of the trust and safety staff. So I suspect that problem is still really hard. Just content moderation at huge scales. At huge scales is really something. And I don't know the full answer to this. I mean, a piece of it could be, you know, to say actually making specific allegations of crimes, this isn't the right place to do that. You know, we've got a huge database. If you've got an accusation of crime, here's who you should call. The police, the FBI, whatever it is. It's not to be done in public. And then you do face really complicated questions about Me Too movement and people coming forward in public and all of that. But it's again, it's like, probably you should talk to a journalist, right? Probably there are better avenues than just tweeting from an account that was created 10 days ago, obviously set up to abuse someone. So I think they could do a lot better. But I also admit it's a hard problem. And there's also ways to indirectly or more humorously or more mocking way to make the same kinds of accusations. In fact, the accusations you mentioned, if I were to guess, don't go that viral because they're not funny enough or cutting enough. But if you make it witty and cutting and meme it somehow, sometimes actually indirectly make an accusation versus directly make an accusation that can go viral and that can destroy reputations and you get those. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I remember another case that didn't bother me because it wasn't of that nature, but somebody was saying, "I'm sure you're making millions off of Wikipedia." And I'm like, "No, actually, I don't even work there. I have no salary." And they're like, "You're lying. I'm going to check your 990 form," which is the US form for tax reporting. Yeah. For charities. Yeah, I'm knocking. Here's the link. Go read it and you'll see. I'm listed as a board member and my salary is listed as zero. So things like that, it's like, "Okay, that one, that feels like you're wrong, but I can take that and we can have that debate quite quickly." And again, it didn't go viral because it was kind of silly. And if anything would have gone viral, it was me responding. But that's one where it's like, actually, I'm happy to respond because a lot of people don't know that I don't work there and that I don't make millions and I'm not a billionaire. Well, they must know that because it's in most news media about me. But the other one I didn't respond to publicly because it's like Barbra Streisand effect. It's like sometimes calling attention to someone who's abusing you, who basically has no followers and so on, it's just a waste. And everything you're describing now is just something that all of us have to learn because everybody's in the public eye. I think when you have just two followers and you get bullied by one of the followers, it's just like, "Oh, I'm not going to do that." Yeah. It's not just a bunch of followers. It hurts just as much as when you have a large number. Yeah. So it's not your situation, I think, is echoed in the situations of millions of other, especially teenagers and kids and so on. Yeah. I mean, it's actually an example. So we don't generally use my picture and the banners anymore on Wikipedia, but we did. And then we did an experiment one year where we tried other people's pictures, so one of our developers. And, you know, one guy, lovely, very sweet guy. And he doesn't look like your immediate thought of a nerdy Silicon Valley developer. He looks like a heavy metal dude because he's cool. And so suddenly here he is with long hair and tattoos, and there's his sort of say, "Here's what your money goes for. Here's my letter asking for support." And he got massive abuse from Wikipedia, calling him creepy and really massive. And this was being shown to 80 million people a day. Yeah. His picture, not the abuse, right? The abuse was elsewhere on the internet. And he was bothered by it. And I thought, you know what? There is a difference. I actually am in the public eye. I get huge benefits from being in the public eye. I go around and make public speeches. If any random thing I think of, I can write and get it published in the New York Times and, you know, have this interesting life. He's not a public figure. And so actually, he wasn't mad at us. He wasn't mad. It was just like, yeah, actually suddenly being thrust in the guy and you get suddenly lots of abuse, which normally, you know, if you're a teenager and somebody in your class is abusing you, it's not going to go viral. So you're only going to, it's going to be hurtful because it's local and it's your classmates or whatever. But when sort of ordinary people go viral in some abusive way, it's really, really quite tragic. I don't know. Even at a small scale, it feels viral. When five people, I suppose you're right. Yeah. Five people at your school and there's a rumor and there's this feeling like you're surrounded and nobody, and the feeling of loneliness, I think, which you're speaking to when you don't have a plat, when you at least feel like you don't have a platform to defend yourself. Yeah. And then this powerlessness that I think a lot of teenagers definitely feel and a lot of people. I think you're right. And that, I think even when just like two people make up stuff about you or lie about you or say mean things about you or bully you, that can feel like a crowd. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. - And it's a terrible, I mean, whatever that is in our genetics and our biology and our, the way our brain works. It just can be a terrifying experience, and somehow to correct that, I mean, I think, because everybody feels the pain of that. Everybody suffers-- - Yeah. - The pain of that. I think we'll be forced to fix that as a society, to figure out a way around that. - I think it's really hard to fix, because I don't think that problem isn't necessarily new. You know, someone in high school who writes graffiti that says Becky is a slut, and spreads a rumor about what Becky did last weekend, that's always been damaging, it's always been hurtful, and that's really hard. - Those kinds of attacks are as old as time itself. They precede the internet. Now, what do you think about this technology that feels Wikipedia-like, which is community notes on Twitter? Do you like it? - Yeah. pros and cons. Do you think it's scalable? - I do like it. I don't know enough about specifically how it's implemented to really have a very deep view, but I do think it's quite... The uses I've seen of it I've found quite good, and in some cases changed my mind. It's like, I see something. And of course the sort of human tendency is to retweet something that you hope is true or that you are afraid is true. Or it's like that kind of quick mental action. And then I saw something that I liked and agreed with, and then a community note under it that made me think, oh, actually this is a more nuanced issue. So I like that. I think that's really important. Now, how is it specifically implemented? Is it scalable? I don't really know how they've done it, so I can't really comment on that. But in general, I do think it's, when you're only mechanisms on Twitter, and you're a big Twitter user, we know the platform and you've got plenty of followers and all of that. The only mechanisms are retweeting, replying, blocking. It's a pretty limited scope, and it's kind of good if there's a way to elevate a specific thoughtful response. And it kind of goes to, again, like, does the algorithm just pick the retweet or the, I mean, retweeting, it's not even the algorithm that makes it viral. Like, you know, if Paolo Quello, very famous author, I think he's got like, I don't know, I haven't looked lately. He used to have 8 million Twitter followers. I think I looked, he's got 16 million now or whatever. Well, if he retweets something, it's gonna get seen a lot. Or Elon Musk, if he retweets something, it's gonna get seen a lot. That's not an algorithm. That's just the way the platform works. So it is kind of nice if you have something, you know, something else, and how that something else is designed, that's obviously a complicated question. - Well, there's this interesting thing that I think Twitter's doing, but I know Facebook is doing for sure, which is really interesting. So you have, what are the signals that a human can provide at scale? Like, in Twitter, it's retweet. - Yep. - In Facebook, I think you can share. I think, yeah, but there's basic interactions. You can have comment and so on. - Yeah. - But there's also in Facebook, and YouTube has this too, is would you like to see more of this, or would you like to see less of this? They post that sometimes. And the thing that the neural net that's learning from that has to figure out is the intent behind you saying, "I wanna see less of this." Did you see too much of this content already? You like it, but you don't wanna see so much of it. You've already figured it out, great, or does this content not make you feel good? There's so many interpretations that I would like to see of this, but if you get that kind of signal, it actually can create a really powerfully curated list of content that is fed to you every day. That doesn't create an echo chamber or a silo. It actually just makes you feel good in the good way, which is like it challenges you, but it doesn't exhaust you and make you kind of this weird animal. - I've been saying for a long time, if I went on Facebook, one morning, and they said, "Oh, we're testing a new option." Rather than showing you things we think you're going to like, we wanna show you some things that we think you will disagree with, but which we have some signals that suggest it's of quality. Like, now that sounds interesting. - Yeah, that sounds really interesting. - I wanna see something where, you know, like, "Oh, I don't agree with." So Larry Lessig is a good friend of mine, founder of Creative Commons, and he's moved on to doing stuff about corruption and politics and so on. And I don't always agree with Larry, but I always grapple with Larry because he's so interesting and he's so thoughtful that even when we don't agree, I'm like, "Actually, I wanna hear him out," right? Because I'm gonna learn from it. And that doesn't mean I always come around to agreeing with him, but I'm gonna understand a perspective on it. And that's really a great feeling. - Yeah, there's this interesting thing on social media where people kind of accuse others of saying, "Well, you don't wanna hear opinions that you disagree with or ideas you disagree with." I think this is something that's thrown at me all the time. The reality is there's literally almost nothing I enjoy more. - It seems like an odd thing to accuse you of because you have quite a wide range of long conversations with a very diverse bunch of people. - But there is a very harsh drop-off because what I like is high-quality disagreement that really makes me think. And at a certain point, there's a threshold, it's kind of a gray area when the quality of the disagreement... - Yeah. - It just sounds like mocking and you're not really interested in a deep understanding of the topic or you yourself don't seem to carry deep understanding of the topic. There's something called intelligence squared debates. The main one is the British version. With the British accent, everything always sounds better. And the Brits seem to argue more intensely, like they're invigorated, they're energized by the debate. Those people, I often disagree with basically everybody involved and it's so fun. I learned something. That's high-quality. If we could do that, if there's some way for me to click a button that says, "Filter out lower quality just today." Sometimes show it to me because I want to be able to... But today, I'm just not in the mood for the mockery. Just high-quality stuff. Even Flat Earth, I want to get high-quality arguments for the Flat Earth. It would make me feel good because I would see, "Oh, that's really interesting." I would see it as a very interesting thing. I would see it as a very interesting thing. I would see it as a very interesting thing. I would see it as a very interesting thing. I would see it as a very interesting thing.
