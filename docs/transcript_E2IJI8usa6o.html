They then hired some fairly bright people like Lee DeForest. They then did things like provided jobs for people like the young Fred Turman, whose father was a Stanford scientist. Now, he really plays an outsized role in setting up the Stanford Industrial Park, attracting Fairchild Semiconductor.</p><p>Fairchild Semiconductor attracts these people and then repels them because you have this brilliant guy Shockley, right? He's both brilliant and sort of personally abhorrent who manages to attract brilliant people and then repel all of them. And so they all end up dispersing themselves into different companies and they create this incredibly creative ecosystem that is the heart of Silicon Valley.</p><p>I think the thing that many of us worry about in terms of Silicon Valley more recently is it feels much more like it's a one industry town, which is dangerous. And it feels more like it's a bunch of industrial behemoths rather than a bunch of smart and scrappy startups.</p><p>And that's a recipe that feels much more like Detroit in the 1950s than it does like Silicon Valley in the 1960s.</p></div></div></body></html>
