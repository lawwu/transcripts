But I had multiple friends saying it over and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">over again. And then like, you know, if I had listened to them, and done something about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">12 months after that, I probably would have made like a million dollars off of just putting in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit of money into this thing. And so I developed a rule, basically, that was if three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">smart friends, like three friends that I consider intelligent, tell me about the same thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to put like a little bit of skin into the game, no matter what, even if I'm not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to go deeper on it, it just like gives me kind of a hedge against looking like an idiot later</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on, like I did with that one. Zile, thanks for being here. I'm so happy to be doing this in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">person. I know. I don't do a lot of these in person. We're here in New York City at Podstream,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which I've never been to, but right in the center of Times Square, but we are in a dark room between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">two ferns, as it were. Yeah, we are. So, so much of what you've written online for the past few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">years has had a big impact on me. And every time I come into a conversation, I'm like, oh, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">so much, but I got this advice from someone recently about travel. They said, whenever you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">go to travel, pretend like you're going to that city a million times for the rest of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Just don't, don't feel like this is your last trip. So I'm gonna treat this conversation like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not our last conversation on the show, so I don't have to cover everything. So I thought back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of the first content of yours that I'd read, and it was all about razors, which at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">time I was like, I don't even know what that is. And I felt like that would be a great place to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">start for this conversation, but like everyone else listening, I'm sure people don't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">razors are. So can you talk a little bit about what they even are and we can jump into why they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">important? Yeah, absolutely. So it's not for shaving. Yeah. Would be the first thing I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">start with, I suppose. No, I mean, a philosophical razor, the term is from philosophy and basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea is that it's a rule of thumb or some sort of decision-making heuristic that allows you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">cut through available options and make a decision. So the whole idea was like in philosophy, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">take a razor and it allows you to like strip away any of the unnecessary things in order to cut</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">through the noise and just make a decision. So Occam's razor is the one that if people know a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">single razor, Occam's razor is the thing they've heard of. And that's like the whole idea that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">basically simple is beautiful. It's like if you have a whole bunch of hypotheses, the one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">requires the fewest assumptions is generally the one that is right. If you're kind of like looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to decide which path you believe is the driver of some situation. So I've written a bunch about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">razors and basically like extending the concept into a whole bunch of different realms. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot about ways to simplify decision-making. It's always been something that I've liked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You're sort of similar to that, like life hacks, right? Are all sort of razors in their own way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shape or form, like ways to make a decision, cut through things, that'll just simplify your life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully, like tools in your toolkit. So that's been the kind of genesis of me writing about them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in the past. Yeah, I think when it comes to my whole scope in life is like, how do I optimize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">everything? I think one of the challenges you get into is there's just too much and you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">overwhelmed. So for me, I love these idea of razors, rules of thumb to just make some of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a little easier. Although the risk is that you then have like a million razors, which would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the pushback against this, which is like, "Oh, I have a million razors. I can't remember a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one of them." So the way I always think about these things is like tools in your toolkit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't need to like know that you have all of those different wrenches or all those different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">things at every single point in time. You just need to like have your toolkit and be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">open it up and think about, "Okay, what applies to a situation at any point in time?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I don't expect anyone listening to go home and be like, "I got 17 razors to use in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">life." I did try to bulk them into a couple of categories because I thought that might be helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for people to think, "Okay, I need to make a decision on this thing. Is there something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">might make this easier?" So the first one I thought about was related to people. There's people in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">your life. First one I had was the optimist razor, which I consider myself an optimist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so I like this one. Let's start there and kind of go through a few people one and see where we get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So the optimist razor is basically the idea that you should always default to trying to spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">time with optimists. And if you have a choice between spending time with optimists and pessimists,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you're always better off spending time with optimists. And the grounding of this, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I originally came up with this during like the period of COVID when there was a whole ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">pessimism out there around like, "Oh, the markets are going to hell.

I mean, the Fed was printing trillions and trillions of dollars. And what I found was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">my initial skew was to pessimism.

And really regretted that after a few months when I realized that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the optimists were actually the ones that were getting rich by betting on things going well in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that time period. And so, I started just thinking about, "Well, there's this little heuristic that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pessimists sound really smart, but optimists seem to be getting really rich." And it all of a sudden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cemented in my mind like, "Okay, there's something to this. And really, I want to be spending more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">time around optimists in general."

I mean, that's why it applies so broadly to life. And when I took it beyond that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I just started thinking, "Who do you feel good when you're around?"

But being around people that are positive and optimistic about the future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about what it looks like in any arena, just tends to feel better. And what I find is that good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">things happen when you spend time with optimists.

And I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay." It's clearly crossed to the mainstream, but the use cases everyone's excited about are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not necessarily use cases that I think will drive business. The challenge I have is it's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that I feel really passionate about being big and have no clue how to bet on. And there was a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">good episode of the All In podcast where they were debating how to invest in this space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are some of the smartest investors in the world. And I can't remember which one said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"I still haven't invested." Because if you look at the early days of so many of these industries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">even look at social, the first few social networks actually didn't work out. And so I'm frustrated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because I feel like there's a there there, but I don't actually know what to do about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You also have to separate it. If you're going to invest, you also have to separate it from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hype cycle. Normally, TSA agents talking about it, I would say is really peak hype cycle of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something. And so hype cycle drives valuations. And so if you're looking... I have this fund where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I invest in early stage companies. And if you were to look at the average deal that says they're an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">AI company right now, the valuation at pre-seed or seed is like $25, $30 million, which is very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">very hard to drive a return in the aggregate across an asset class. And so that's what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">struggle with. They're benefiting from hype cycle on their early valuation, which hurts investors on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the margin. And so it's tough. It's tough to discern, "Okay, what's there? What's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to get eaten by whatever big company decides to do this?" It's tricky. And most of them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way, are just doing an open AI API call. They don't actually have anything internally or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">proprietary about it. And so again, it's like, "Okay, you're just linking to another person's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">platform." Yeah. The number of companies that have pitched me a thing that's like, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we take a document and we give you answers on it." And I'm like, "There's literally... You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just monetizing this other API." With your own UI/UX. Although a lot of companies have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">built in that general way in different areas where it's just like, "Oh, we link to whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">platform we're using their backend." So I'm not saying that company can't make money. I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">skeptical in investing in anything at these valuations. Totally. Totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But to come back to Razors, what do you do when someone comes to you with a crazy idea?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, man. So my favorite thing around crazy ideas is... I think it was Paul Graham. Yes. Paul Graham,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the famous investor, he didn't actually frame it as a Razor. I turned it into a Razor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but he wrote this piece on what to do if someone comes to you with a crazy idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, his thing boiled down to two questions to ask yourself, "Are they a domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">expert? And do I know them to be a reasonable person?" And if the answer to both of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">things is yes, then you should probably take the idea seriously because it might be an asymmetric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bet on the future. And I thought that was such an elegant way to think about this because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very easy to write off crazy ideas. You hear something and you're like, "You don't understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this." You're just like, "That sounds ridiculous. That seems ludicrous that that would ever happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or that the future would look like that." But if you slow down and you ask yourself those two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">questions, you can actually totally deconstruct the entire problem. You're asking, "Are they a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">domain expert? So do they understand this thing that they're talking about, the area around this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thing very, very well?" If the answer is yes, move on to the next question, which is, "Are they a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reasonable person or are they completely ridiculous?" And if you know they're completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ridiculous, you're like, "Okay, maybe I'm going to hesitate a little bit." But if they're not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if you know that they're a reasonable person and that they do reasonable things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">now you start to take the whole thing seriously a little bit based on those two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've always thought that that was a really, really good way to cut through the noise on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I find that my instinct is often to be like, "That's not right."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's most of our common instinct when we hear anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially because I don't understand it. I'm not technical enough to know on most of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when someone says something that sounds crazy to me about the future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what the future is going to look like, what people are going to be doing, my default is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"That's stupid. No, no way." And generally, on five or 10-year time horizons, anything I thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was stupid, I've been completely wrong about. If there were enough people talking about eSports,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people filling... Someone said this to me in, I don't know, it's probably 2009. When I got to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">college, someone was like, "Dude, eSports is going to be the next big thing. People are going to fill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">stadiums watching people play video games." And I was like, "You are an idiot. I'm not listening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to you anymore. That was dumb." And again, if I had bet on that in some way, that would have turned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">out pretty well for me at the time. And so now my new default is like, I take anything any smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">person says, at least remotely seriously. It's like I had one of my razors was around listening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the whole idea was like, if someone says something that is very different from your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">beliefs, you should listen twice as much as you speak. And that applies to this type of thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with new investment ideas or ideas on what the future of technology looks like, just as much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">as political debates or anything that you're trying to educate yourself on. Because generally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">our bias when we hear something that we don't agree with becomes, "Okay, I'm just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">talk over them and I'm going to tell them why they're wrong about this thing." But if you flip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the script on that and you say, "I'm actually just going to listen to a whole bunch and at least hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">them out," usually you end up learning something. Even if you don't agree with them at the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that's fine, but you end up learning something from how they're thinking about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, also, I think one of your life hacks, so Silas' great PDF of 50 life hacks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if I remember right, is trying to be interested, not interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

What I like is that, in a lot of those posts, you say, "Hey, use this when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're deciding who to hang out with. Use this when." We can link there if you want to recap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">from this conversation. The other area that you alluded to at the beginning is making decisions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think is something that, when optimized, can really save you time because I know myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and a lot of people listening spend a lot of time making decisions, trying to get to the optimal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">outcome. So, let's talk about a few of these decision-making ones. Let's start with the arena.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The arena. This all comes from the man in the arena, Teddy Roosevelt's speech of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"It's the person in the arena that really counts." And my whole operating principle around this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that you should always try to put yourself in the arena. And that takes on different forms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in different areas of life, but basically, don't sit on the sidelines and sling rocks at people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that are out there doing things. And so, if you have a choice of two paths of how to operate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you should put yourself in the vulnerable position in the arena because that's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you end up having the high upside things happen. That's where real growth occurs and where you end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">up having those wins, et cetera. You can't really win long-term by sitting on the sidelines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">especially not sitting on the sidelines throwing rocks at people that are out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you said this is the one you feel the most strong about in one of these posts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you seen a lot of personal wins from playing this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

She's like, "I'm just having a bad day." And she posted a picture of Ben and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Jerry's.

And people are like, "I can't believe you would promote a brand like that." Or like, "Can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you eat healthier ice cream?"

I think defaulting to empathy is the single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">healthiest and best way that I've found to combat negativity. Basically, when someone says something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">super negative on the internet to someone that they don't know, it's pretty fair to assume that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that person is not in a happy place in their life. Like happy people... Have you seen Legally Blonde?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This is going to be an embarrassing reference. In the movie Legally Blonde, she's like, "Happy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">people just don't kill their husbands. They just don't." And I think about that with happy people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on the internet. Happy people just don't comment mean things to other people's posts on the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They just don't. It's just not a thing that you would think to do. You're a happy guy. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">think you would think to go and attack someone that you don't know on the internet.

And so, I tend to think that when someone attacks you with negativity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there's usually something that's going on in their life that's tough. And we don't know what that is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're not behind that person's eyes. And so, I try to default to empathy when I read something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like that, of just like, "Oh, that person's having a tough day." Or the person is in a tough spot for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever reason, and not get all wound up about it.

I'm not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">make their life better or change it. And so, there's no point. Back to some of the career</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. What about when you're faced with trying to decide between two paths you could take at work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is one from Naval that I really like, where he talks about making uphill decisions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think is the way that he phrases it.

But if you're sitting at an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">event, you're trying to figure out, "Well, who are these people?" Because maybe you are trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to do some networking.

What's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">your story is just a much better opener, especially when you're around people that maybe are in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">between jobs and it's super awkward to be like, "What do you do?" It's like, "Well, I don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a job right now." Yeah. And if you know them, if they are someone that everybody knows,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3038" target="_blank">00:50:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and you know what their story is, and they know that everybody knows them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3041" target="_blank">00:50:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I've always found that just telling someone that you admire something that they've done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is a great, great opener. No one is immune to flattery. And people love to know that people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have recognized things that they've done. Bill Gates, when I first said hello to him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I just told him I admired his philanthropic work in the developing world, because I really do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen a lot of impact from it.

And no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one will look at you and be like, "Shut up," when you say something nice to them about things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they've done.

I will say, if you can find a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">question to ask someone about what they're excited about in that realm, but that ties</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3097" target="_blank">00:51:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">into something that you have some unique expertise in, or I think we all probably know the topic that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe lights up the room when you talk about, I wouldn't try to just jump in and have that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you could steer the conversation towards a place where something that you're uniquely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3113" target="_blank">00:51:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledgeable about.

Well, for me, this idea came to me when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "What are you excited about?"

It's like, I could steer the conversation towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">something related to travel. That would be something where I'd be like, "I probably have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">some interesting hacks or tips to the average audience." But in a way that gets them to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it there in a way that they're excited about. That's a very good idea. It's like shepherding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">them.

That's smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But I want to come back finally to where we spend our time. And you have a Time Billionaire Razor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but you actually did a really great post about this and looked at some data on how we spend time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, maybe let's end talking about how we spend our time and how that's evolved for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, this is a topic that's very near and dear to my heart. You have young kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess by the time this comes out, he will be one.

Part of that is because when you have a young kid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you all of a sudden start measuring time in weeks and months, which you never really do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise. People ask you how old the kid is and you say like six weeks or nine weeks or 12 weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. I've never thought about the passage of weeks as a passage of time. In the past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just like another week. A lot of people have now seen that life calendar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like Memento Mori calendar, where it's 52 rows across and it's 80 rows down. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it represents your entire life.

So, I've been thinking about this stuff more and more over the course of the last year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I came across this American Time Use Survey data set that I think it was Our World and Data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of crunched together to look at how we spend time over the course of our lives and specifically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">who we spend it with.

And it was an unbelievably powerful image when you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">them individually because you really get a feel for like, especially with kids, how you basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">spend all of your time with them during this very short window of their life and then it falls off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a cliff.

And so have you made changes in the last year as a result of thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this? Yeah. I mean, the biggest change we made was in May 2021 where we picked up our life and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sold our house in California, bought a house in New York and moved to be closer to my parents and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to my wife's parents. And that was based on the initial realization of how little time we had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3319" target="_blank">00:55:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">left with our parents.

They're like a big, big part of my son's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">life, similar with my wife's parents.

I mean, I think it's this friend of mine, Kay, he, who has talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3356" target="_blank">00:55:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about the magic, the magic window, I think he calls it, or the magic years, which is like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">10 year period of time where you are your kid's favorite person in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvw_yeb_3I&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And once they're older than 10, there are other people that fill that role.
