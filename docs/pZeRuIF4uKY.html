What's the premise behind the show?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Curious Mike the idea well the name started from you. I remember we were in L.A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you came up with the name but way before that I had kind of been wanting to figure out some way to use my platform to influence people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I didn't want it to really be Instagram and I didn't really want it to be Twitter because you know you post a picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you can write a caption and that's about it. And I've always been someone who has had a lot of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I always felt like I thought differently than a lot of people and always just thought about the deeper things in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that has gotten me into trouble at times because you know Twitter or Instagram like they'll take like short clips of what I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then the whole world would see it and then they get a picture of who you are as a person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so honestly that took me away from social media for a while like I didn't want anything to do with social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And during that time away I wanted to figure out a way to still use my platform but not necessarily be on Instagram all day like everybody else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I came up with the idea for like a podcast or like a YouTube just talking about the real things in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Things that people don't necessarily talk about. I tend to be very curious just the deeper things in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I decided a podcast or a YouTube channel would be the way to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you know I brought it to you and then you thought Curious Mike would be a good name because that just kind of describes me ever since I was really little.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of how it started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah I feel like the name Curious Mike describes you because it's like a humble approach to just trying to figure out life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like the way your mind works you're always asking questions. You're just seeking knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're seeking to understand things on like a deeper level and it's almost like society doesn't have grace for people asking questions anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like you're creating a space where you can ask questions and try to figure things out without like judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah like you said that was the whole idea for me because in today's age if your thought patterns or what you say goes against the narrative they'll cancel you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can't really have your own opinion or people are scared to speak their mind because of the backlash they might get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And like I said like I've always been someone that is comfortable speaking my mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I mean even for me with the backlash I would get with some of the things I would say and people not understanding you know the intent behind it or why I said it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just it kind of bothered me because we should be able to live in a world where people can you know speak their mind ask questions and be curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No one has it all figured out. And I just feel like the more we can openly talk about things and you know right or wrong then the better we'll be as a society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Just being able to listen. I feel like that's a big thing on your show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have guests on that have maybe some different perspectives than you. Some are the same and you just want to listen and learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what is something that you have learned through one of your guests that you're really excited for people to hear about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And who are your guests? You can go through who they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So first four guests. Lecrae.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to be a great leader man. Like be careful bro because I can see I just could feel like with the type of insight and curiosity you have like that's just Satan don't want you to win bro. He don't want you to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've always been a big fan of his and his music and just his perspective on life. You know being in the rap culture but trying to be different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have my aunt Nancy who I think she's 86 or 87 now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure. She's up there but she's one of the most energetic joyful people that I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I wanted to get her on there and just you know talk about you know being living life so long living through so many different periods of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just I feel like you can get a lot of wisdom from older people. And then you got Trey Young who's been one of my best friends ever since we started playing basketball together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know you kind of have a mindset of like you're not you're not worried about what other people say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. But it took me a while to get to this point. I think it's tough because our generation is like is the first generation that's really going through this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know we just talk about all kinds of things more basketball related and you know the pressures of being an NBA player and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then lastly you got Judah Smith who's a celebrity passed out in L.A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't even love ourselves without the help of Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had so many sleepless nights where I wondered am I ever going to fix this temptation these challenges these weaknesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's around a lot of different celebrities but he also is one of the most humble down to earth people I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm just you know asking all these guys different questions like my goal is to just have people on the show that I respect and that I you know I want to learn from them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I see how they view life and I just want to ask questions and get to know more about them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know I feel like the people watching will be able to just see a side of me and just see a side of these other people that you know a lot of celebrities or famous people don't necessarily show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though like I said all the time we're all just people like no one's supposed to be more famous or anything than another person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're all just people that happen to be talented at different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So is there one conversation that you've had in those interviews that has you feel like has really stuck with you and that you're really hoping people learn from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They all have their bits and pieces like each one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like those dudes are really really smart and give really good answers to some of the tough questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can't

person out there that is just a fun question that you really want to have on the show that is kind of a reach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I really always have loved Jim Carrey and his acting.</span></div><div

would be famous so that they could be famous and realize that that's not where you find peace and happiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to get him on the show because there's a movie called The Truman Show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the movie you know he's

thinks it's real life and then he finally escapes and realizes what reality is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And honestly like watching that show for the longest time like I thought that was me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
