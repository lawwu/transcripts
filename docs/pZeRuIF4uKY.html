And just share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with everyone what the project actually is. What is Curious Mike? What's the premise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">behind the show? So Curious Mike the idea, well the name started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">from you. I remember we were in L.A. and you came up with the name. But way before that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I had kind of been wanting to figure out some way to use my platform to influence people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I didn't want it to really be Instagram and I didn't really want it to be Twitter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because you know you post a picture and then you can write a caption and that's about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've always been someone who has had a lot of questions, always felt like I thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">differently than a lot of people and always just thought about the deeper things in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And that has gotten me into trouble at times because you know Twitter or Instagram like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll take like short clips of what I would say and then the whole world would see it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they get a picture of who you are as a person. And so honestly that took me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">away from social media for a while like I didn't want anything to do with social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And during that time away I wanted to figure out a way to still use my platform but not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily be on Instagram all day like everybody else. And so I came up with the idea for like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a podcast or like a YouTube just talking about the real things in life. Things that people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">don't necessarily talk about. I tend to be very curious, just the deeper things in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I decided a podcast or a YouTube channel would be the way to go. And then you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I brought it to you and then you thought Curious Mike would be a good name because that just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of describes me ever since I was really little. So that's kind of how it started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah I feel like the name Curious Mike describes you because it's like a humble approach to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just trying to figure out life. I feel like the way your mind works you're always asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">questions. You're just seeking knowledge. You're seeking to understand things on like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a deeper level. And it's almost like society doesn't have grace for people asking questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">anymore. I feel like you're creating a space where you can ask questions and try to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things out without like judgment. And yeah like you said that was the whole idea for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">me because in today's age if your thought patterns or what you say goes against the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">narrative they'll cancel you. Or you can't really have your own opinion or people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">scared to speak their mind because of the backlash they might get. And like I said like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I've always been someone that is comfortable speaking my mind. But I mean even for me with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the backlash I would get with some of the things I would say and people not understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know the intent behind it or why I said it. It just it kind of bothered me because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we should be able to live in a world where people can you know speak their mind ask questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZeRuIF4uKY&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and be curious.
