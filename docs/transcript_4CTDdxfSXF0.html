That's how you learn it. So I think, it's not just me, I think our course is very good, but also lots of people independently, is that it's very good. It recently won the COGX award for AI courses as being the best in the world. I'd say come to our course, course.fast.ai. The thing I keep on hopping on in my lessons is, train models, print out the inputs to the models, print out to the outputs to the models, study, change the inputs a bit, look at how the outputs vary, just run lots of experiments to get an intuitive understanding of what's going on. >> To get hooked, you mentioned training, do you think just running the models inference? If we talk about getting started. >> No, you've got to fine-tune the models. So that's the critical thing, because at that point, you now have a model that's in your domain area. So there's no point running somebody else's model because it's not your model. It only takes five minutes to fine-tune a model for the data you care about. In lesson two of the course, we teach you how to create your own dataset from scratch by scripting Google Image Search. We show you how to actually create a web application running online. So I create one in the course that differentiates between a teddy bear, a grizzly bear, and a brown bear. It does it with basically 100 percent accuracy. Took me about four minutes to scrape the images from Google Search in the script. There's a little graphical widgets we have in the notebook that help you clean up the dataset. There's other widgets that help you study the results to see where the errors are happening. So now we've got over 1,000 replies in our share your work here thread of students saying, here's the thing I built. So there's people who like, and a lot of them are state of the art. Like somebody said, "Oh, I tried looking at Devan Garey characters and I couldn't believe it. The thing that came out was more accurate than the best academic paper after lesson one." Then there's others which are just more fun, like somebody who's doing Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds. She said that's their national bird and she's got something that can now classify Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds. So yeah, train models, fine-tune models with your dataset, and then study their inputs and outputs. >> How much is Fast.ai courses? >> Free. Everything we do is free. We have no revenue sources of any kind. It's just a service to the community. >> You're a saint. Once a person understands the basics, trains a bunch of models, if we look at the scale of years, what advice do you have for someone wanting to eventually become an expert? >> Train lots of models. Specifically, train lots of models in your domain area. So an expert what? We don't need more expert, like create slightly evolutionary research in areas that everybody's studying. We need experts at using deep learning to diagnose malaria, or we need experts at using deep learning to analyze language to study media bias, or we need experts in analyzing fisheries to identify problem areas in the ocean. That's what we need. So become the expert in your passion area. This is a tool which you can use for just about anything, and you'll be able to do that thing better than other people, particularly by combining it with your passion and domain expertise. >> So that's really interesting. Even if you do want to innovate on transfer learning or active learning, your thought is, I mean, it's one I certainly share, is you also need to find a domain or a dataset that you actually really care for. If you're not working on a real problem that you understand, how do you know if you're doing it any good? How do you know if your results are good? How do you know if you're getting bad results? Why are you getting bad results? Is it a problem with the data? How do you know you're doing anything useful? Yeah, to me, the only really interesting research is, not the only, but the vast majority of interesting research is like try and solve an actual problem and solve it really well. >> Yeah, I think that's really interesting. I mean, I think that's really interesting. I think that's really interesting. I think it's really interesting to see how the world has evolved. I think it's really interesting to see how the world has evolved. I think it's really interesting to see how the world has evolved. I think it's really interesting to see how the world has evolved. I think it's really interesting to see how the world has evolved.</p></div></div></body></html>
