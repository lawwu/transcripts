All of a sudden, their nuclear scientists, the ones who'd worked on their bombs, were free to talk. And we went to various apartments where retired guys from the bomb program were living on, as far as I could tell, a sack of potatoes and some salt.</p><p>They really, you know, they had government pensions and the money was worthless all of a sudden. I was buying photographs from them, partly because I needed the photographs, and partly because I thought, I mean, 20 bucks was two months' income at that point, so it was easy for me and it helped them.</p><p>And in turn, they told me about, by 1947, they had a design for a bomb that they said was half the weight and twice the yield of the Fat Man bomb.</p></div></div></body></html>
