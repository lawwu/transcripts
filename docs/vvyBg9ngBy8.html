If you work in any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of team, you should have docket clearing meetings. So there is my new piece of advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">- I like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">- That's actually in a slow productivity. I'm working on the book and so I have these principles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then the principles underneath the principles are propositions, which are kind of where we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">concrete, like do work on this, work on that, or just give some more concrete ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the propositions have, they come with some like actual pieces of advice. So some of the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is philosophical and manifesto style, some is idea writing, some is let's get concrete. And that came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">out of me working on a proposition about containing the small things. So the footprint stays small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in your work life. And that's, I was just working out the docket clearing meeting idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the, I presented that in the book as the team counterpart to office hours for the individual.

Everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">knows when they are.

You just knock them all away and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">make everyone come every day. There's 30 minutes. They can always come and find you. And that's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">huge inbox saver, but team stuff requires his own type of strategy. So there we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Docket clearing meetings. I've been thinking about slow bar activity a lot. Yeah. Just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on different things I work on, whether it's like work or even getting better at sports. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about it all the time. I finished the chapter. Well, the first draft of the chapter on doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">fewer things. Principle one, it was a beast. It was 25,000 words. I got it down to 18,000 words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">out of my hands. My editor has it took me a long time. So I was trying to figure out the voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I found the voice for the book, but we'll knock on wood. We'll see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've started now I'm working on a part one chapter. So part one is more like ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So part one chapter that's I'm not going to give too many details because it might also be a New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yorker piece. So I like to keep that kind of secret and I'm beginning the background research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for the next principle, which is work at a natural pace. And, you know, this, this idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">constant, like you just work, you know, five days a week, eight hours straight, just again and again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and again, just going after getting after it, just intense. It's very unnatural. It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really match the way that really interesting stuff is produced. I'm just getting the weeds there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I won't give too many details yet, but, but yesterday I was spending a lot of time reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about the timelines of famous scientists from the early Renaissance period. And let's just say the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">pace at which they developed and published their ideas is anything but fast. Like a year will go by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not working on it. And then like the summer they work on it and then they have to send a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">letter and it's 15, 57, 67. So it's going to take, you know, three months before they hear back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a slower pace. They're very productive because they invented, you know, gravity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyBg9ngBy8&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That's coming along.
