Most people pick a easily decipherable, simple password because that's what they can remember, and they use it everywhere. And unfortunately, what you have to understand is that even assuming that you had the most indecipherable, sophisticated password possible, if it's been exposed as a result of a leak or a breach, then it's discovered.</p><p>And a discovered password is no good to you anymore. And if it's through your entire universe of websites, it's going to come back and be a nightmare for you. So you really have to think hard about the kinds of passwords you're going to use. In fact, that's why most people use password managers that want to simplify their lives.</p><p>But you need to do that because one ubiquitous password in your life is guaranteed to create a problem for you.</p></div></div></body></html>
