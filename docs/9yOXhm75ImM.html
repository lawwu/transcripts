So, the way Innovator ETFs work, they're these buffer ETFs, right? You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">have a floor on the downside, a cap to the upside.

So, tomorrow, July 1st, these things rebalance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's take an example. The way that we look at downturns in the market is, they lead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to a wider range of outcomes, and not necessarily in the best direction, right?

So, you could pick this 9% buffer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and realize, okay, I'm protected down 9%.

So, John, do a chart on this. We talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Sun Animal Spirits last week.

I know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you've done a lot of hacking in this stuff.

Because we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with multiple kids, going to the store is not all that much fun.

And so that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">me was like, that seems like a great, you know, starter one card. You know, the points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">can be used to buy travel, but you can also transfer them to, I'm going to get the number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong, but let's say a dozen-ish airlines or hotel groups to use the points. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">one where it's like, gosh, you don't really need two cards if you did. And if you, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">know, you could match it with like Citi Double Cash, which is just 2x on everything. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">now there are a bunch of those, you know, Capital One has this Venture Venture X, both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">those cards, 2x on everything.

So my first rewards card was the United card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

The problem is you look at the United card and it earns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">$2, two points, two United miles per dollar on United. And if you use a chase reserve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">card, you earn three points per dollar on United and you can transfer those points to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">United.

That makes sense. So my general rule of thumb is airline credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">cards do two things really well.

And so if that's something you want, those cards can be great. And maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that perk includes status. Some of these cards will maybe give you some extra miles towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">getting their premier status.

It used to be, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you wanted to book a flight in the United States with United Miles, and it was available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in this low bucket where it was 25,000 miles round trip anywhere, or it wasn't and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">had to pay 50,000 miles and you could use any seat on the plane. Now they're like, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">what's the price?

And there's still deals to be had,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

And that's what happened with Marriott. So, Marriott</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this year switched to, "We're going to change the number of points you need."

And I think everyone in the points world was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Oh gosh, Marriott's going to be totally devalued.

Get out."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they were like, kind of shared what they did and they implemented it. And people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yOXhm75ImM&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">were like, "Well, it wasn't that bad."
