Visit Sweet Hop.com today. Hey, Radicals, this is Joshua Sheets, and today I just have a quick announcement and frankly, an apology to you with regard to email.</p><p>I wanted to do it in a public forum here where you would be able to get the message clearly. Very quickly, if you have emailed me in the past through my contact form or even directly at Joshua Radical Personal Finance dot com, especially through the contact form on the website, if you've emailed me that way and you have not gotten a response from me, please assume that I never actually received your email.</p><p>And the story is that when we switched to the new website, I've been emailing corresponding with you guys via announcing my personal email address again, Joshua Radical Personal Finance dot com. But then in building the new website a year or so ago, we put a contact form on the website.</p><p>At the time that we installed that contact form, we tested everything. Everything was working great. And for several months, I received email contacts through that website. However, in about July of 2015, that contact form stopped working. I don't fully understand all the reasons why. It's some kind of back office issue.</p><p>My web developer spent hours on the phone with Bluehost trying to get the thing resolved. Finally, we're in the process of moving it away from Bluehost and trying to fix the issue. But they know about the issue, but we never figured out how to make it work. So sometime in about July of 2015, the web contact form stopped working.</p><p>And it wasn't until mid February 2016 that I just kind of figured it out when several people had said, "Hey, I tried to contact you and I didn't get a response." I'm thinking I never got an answer. Rookie mistake. Totally a rookie mistake. No excuses for it. I was busy and I never even noticed it.</p><p>I was still getting some emails directly and I just kind of forgot about it. And then when we went and checked and I just said, "Look, we're not getting things through this form." But I wanted you to know because now since we fixed the form, I'm getting three, four, five, six important emails a day.</p><p>Questions from listeners, feedback, personal comments. And it's disheartening to me that perhaps many of you feel ignored. I don't promise that I can always keep pace with email. Up until now, every person who's ever emailed me directly, I've responded with at least a short note, with at least something to say I've read and appreciated the email and if possible, I try to expand on that.</p><p>I'm often a few weeks behind. Just simply letters come in and emails come in and I have to prioritize pretty ruthlessly in order to get stuff done. But if you've emailed me, especially through the web contact form at any time since July, and if you never received a response, please just assume I never received it and I would just ask you go ahead and communicate with me again.</p><p>The web form is now working. That's often the safest way to do it and you can go ahead and send in right on the contact forms on the website. You can communicate with me through there. Feel free to use that. That'll go straight to my inbox or you can email me directly, Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.</p><p>There's always a danger if you email directly that the spam filters might grab things. So the safer thing is to use the contact form on the website. That'll bypass the spam filters. But I just wanted you to know, public apology if I've ignored an email from you. It wasn't intentional.</p><p>So please go ahead and feel free to get back in touch with me. I'd love to hear from you. I solicit any of your comments, any of your feedback, any of your questions, and you can expect at this point, again, I don't promise forever, but at this point at least you can expect a personal reply from me.</p><p>My apologies.
