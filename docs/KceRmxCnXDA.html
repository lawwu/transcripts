But it was just like a bunch of like Barbies and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bunnies and stuffed bears and they all have... The thing about stuffed animals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">now I don't want to generalize, but allow me. The stuffed animals I've seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">always have this kind of dumb smile on their face, this kind of vapid, empty look on their face like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">please love me even though I feel dead inside, but I'm going to keep smiling so you get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">buy me and keep me.

I think to me most stuffed animals are kind of, at least in my imagination of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of have this dumb, vapid look on their face of shallow happiness. And the reason this hedgehog</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">jumped out at me from this bin is he had this deep, almost menacing, but really profound</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">seriousness about him that he was disturbed, both disturbed about the way the world is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and deep in thought about how to fix it. I mean that's how I felt that look came out to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">almost like a mix of the... I think of myself of Prince Mishkin from Dostoevsky's The Idiot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think of Hedgie here as the main character.

So I knew I had to get him. I think there is this connection, and I think you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">experience that connection with people sometimes, and with things, with ideas, with books. It just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">jumps out at you as something profoundly unique. I also think that there's layers of humor and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">absurdity about, first of all, the idea of this hedgehog and the brooding Dostoevsky character</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">amidst the sea of shallow, smiling, stuffed animals, and the fact that I own very few things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and gave away most things I own a couple of times in my life. And the one thing that survived through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that is a stuffed animal from a thrift store that seems to be pissed off at life. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this just makes me smile, the absurdity of it all. And that's why he's, hopefully, until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the building burns down or something, he'll be a lifelong companion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to use this opportunity, using Hedgie here, as a chance to talk about three related</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things. One is minimalism and stoicism, which is very much a part of my life, of how I approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">life.

And finally, friendship. So, on the idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">minimalism, I gave away most things I own a couple of times in my life, so just down to a few clothes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">jeans, shirts, underwear, socks, a pair of shoes, and this most recent time, also a couple of suits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">dress shirts and ties, and a laptop. Now, there's probably way too much to talk about there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and mostly I think it's probably not interesting to people, but I did want to mention or try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">describe my thinking around these steps and why I did it and what kind of lessons I learned, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think there's something extremely powerful when you sit in a room and it's barren, it's empty,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's something about that experience that puts you face to face with your own mortality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KceRmxCnXDA&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and the reality that nothing lasts forever.
