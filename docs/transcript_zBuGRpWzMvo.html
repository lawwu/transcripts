I think it's a neat tool. The sad thing is that if you have no gains to use them as an offset and you are bound by these $3,000 a year, some people will argue it's not really worth the hassle to do that.</p><p>For me personally, because I generate some capital gains, so I do some options trading and that generates both short-term and long-term capital gains. It brings up a whole other issue. So for example, a lot of people now want to do direct indexing, right? So instead of buying the index fund, they still do the index.</p><p>They still do the S&P 500 index, but they implement the S&P 500 index with the underlying constituents. And then you can do a lot more tax-loss harvesting. For some people with a lot of taxable gains that they want to offset, that is very useful. If you don't have a lot of taxable gains and the $3,000 is all you can really offset every year, might be a whole lot of hot air over nothing, but definitely for a lot of people, tax-loss harvesting can be super helpful.</p></div></div></body></html>
