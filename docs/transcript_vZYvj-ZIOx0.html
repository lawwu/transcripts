Sometimes the colleges you're looking at will ultimately be full price, and you have to decide, well, am I going to write a check for 90, or am I going to pursue other schools, or maybe you get some merit aid, or, you know, again, your local state school might only be 30, and kind of finding that balance.</p><p>But there's still a lot you can do, right? There's tax planning, there's saving and investing, there's merit aid, there's negotiating with the schools, there's a lot of planning, just realizing that need-based aid is not on the list. And that's where I think a lot of people get a little confused, is there's a lot more to it than, will I qualify for need-based aid or not?</p><p>Because even if you don't, you know, again, we didn't qualify for need-based aid. College is canceled? No, we're still going, and now it's going to be expensive. So how are we going to raise those kind of funds?</p></div></div></body></html>
