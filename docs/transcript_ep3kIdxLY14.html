Oh, man, that's really hard. Like, I guess the next best thing would be looking at the Korean fabs because they are they're close, but I guess they don't produce the same chips. But I guess, I guess the bet would be that Korea is the country most likely to catch up to Taiwan, in the event that we're mostly going to catch up to where Taiwan is today if Taiwan is no longer an option.</p><p>But I think like if you're betting if you're trying to make the AI bet conditional on Taiwan bet, I think a lot of what you want to do is actually think about how you underwrite the Taiwan invasion bet because that's probably the thing with the bigger...</p></div></div></body></html>
