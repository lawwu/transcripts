More recently, Tim put out a card game. It's called Coyote, and he created it with one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">top designers in the game business, the same company that invented exploding kittens.

I'm just curious about that world, so we start there, but then we go deeper. Tim and I talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">about his path to stardom. We talk about the autonomy and depth he had in his life circa the time when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was writing The 4-Hour Workweek, and then how his own success stripped some of that away, and his effort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">since then to get it back. We talk about his future plans for his podcast and for writing where he wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to go from here. We really get into some really interesting territory about one of the masters of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this topic, how he feels, what he's thinking about, and what he wants to do. This is a must-listen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">episode if you have any interest in the deep life. Tim really is sort of the OG of the deep life as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">concept, and he obviously has a lot of interesting things to say. He speaks from a place of deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">deep experience. So anyways, let's get right into it. Without further ado, here is my conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with Tim Ferriss. All right, Tim, thank you for joining me. Always a pleasure to talk with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. Lovely to have the band back together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the way to think about it. So, I mean, I want to open with the reason why we originally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">thought about talking, which is you made a game. Yeah, WTF. What's happening here? I'm holding this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">up to the camera. Yeah. Coyote. Walk us through, just to set the foundation, just give us the basics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">here, what type of game it is, who you did this with, and where is it, just so we know where we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">on the same page. Sure. So the basics are, and there's a lot of backstory, but I grew up kind of saved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">by games, mostly very complex games like Dungeons and Dragons. I still have all of my materials</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">downstairs from when I was a kid. And I, for a host of reasons, felt like games, analog, social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is just every year. As kind of digital goes vertical, the counterbalance of analog and social is becoming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">more and more important. So I thought, you know what? Maybe I should make a game. And it is a fast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">casual, social game. Made it with exploding kittens because I became close friends with Elan Lee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">used my podcast to sort of test the waters. And they've made a whole host of great games and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">tested a few dozen games with my friends and came across Poetry for Neanderthals, which is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">exceptional game. Maybe it's just by me and my dumb friends, but that's the one they wanted to play over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and over again. And I was like, well, who made this game? Oh, Exploding Kittens. Who's behind Exploding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Kittens? And that's how I kind of pulled on the thread. And right now, Coyote is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's doing very well. It's got like 300 million plus social views of gameplay online. And you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">find it everywhere. Just launched. And it plays three to eight folks, typically. Kids can play,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say, 10 plus. So very, very simple to learn, but different every game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems like it's physical memory. How do you describe this game plan? It's like, okay, so if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">have to do motions and the ones and the cards, as the cards come down, it changes what people have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">do and trying to keep track of where everything is. And it gets kind of frenetic. So under the hood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of my books are designed this way as well. There is a Trojan horse with this game. So it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to be fun. And people need to want to tell their friends about it and play again, right? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">table stakes. But under the hood, it is also a workout for your brain. And I've spent a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">time thinking about this kind of thing. But by and large, people are not interested in buying things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to make them smarter. I know it sounds crazy, but I've tried this multiple times in the US,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">at least it does not work. So this has to be a side effect. But yes, it's basically a gesture rhythm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and verbal game where it's almost like rock, paper, scissors on steroids for a group where you try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">match all these things as you go around the table. And if anyone makes a mistake, they lose a life and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">then last person standing wins. You can also play cooperatively. If you have someone in your family</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">who's a really sore loser or a friend who's just complaints too much. But the competitive mode is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really kind of where the smack talking and I think the adrenaline and a lot of the fun is. So it is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">rhythm and gesture game where people have to perform an action, say what's on the card, and go around in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a circle keeping a certain rhythm. And the reason it's called Coyote is because I want people to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">their inner trickster if you think of the mythologies around Coyote in many of the indigenous cultures in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">North America, also in Mexico.

In every culture, whether it's Loki, Ictomi, or others, there is some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">type of trickster. And the reason that's part of the game is you can sabotage other players.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have somebody who's really good at, say, math or music, those folks tend to be very good at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">game, you can handicap them by slapping them with attack cards and things like that. So that's the game. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you can learn to play in a few minutes.

So I've been playing a lot more games versus just staring at a screen 18 inches away, all day, every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">day.

Because I think about this type of game that you called it casual or fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">casual. Is that what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. And there are there are lots. One thing I realized and part of the reason this took two years to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">make is there's so many different. If you say I want to make a game, it's kind of like saying I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">start a business. It's like, okay, well, we need to drill down a little bit. So you could call this, I would I would describe it as fast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">casual, there are other ways to describe it. But meaning, after dinner, you've got an hour,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe a few people have had some drinks, what do you play? If you try to play some of these other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">games, which are fine games, wonderful games, terraforming Mars, you're never going to get it done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Yeah. And furthermore, if people are tired, or a little fatigued after a long work day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be hard to recruit people, at least my friends to play it. So so this is along the lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of an Uno, or the Monopoly Go card game, something like that. It's closer to that side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So because what fascinates me is it reminds me of screenwriting. And here's the connection I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">make there is that when you talk to screenwriters, they say, look, people think this is easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when a when a script is on the screen, and it works, you're like, I could think up a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">similar idea for a movie, and I know how to talk. I'm not watching someone drill, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Steph Curry drill a three pointer from six feet behind the line like, oh, I can do this.

Yeah, a good fast casual game if constructed, right? You're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, this is just fun. Like you have some rules, you have some ideas, it kind of goes back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I talk to screenwriters, they say the issue with the screenplays, everything has to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">right. It's a watch mechanism, like everything. And you don't realize a very good way to put it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If you introduce like, you know, Chekhov's gun, like you mentioned this here, it better pay off there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">No dialogue cannot have a purpose like this has to connect to this and even a bad screenplay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to be a professional screenwriter to have written the bad screenplay because there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a technical complexity that just making a script that everything connects together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I assume this is similar for making a game like this.

What goes on in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">world to actually make a game like that? Yeah, let's talk about it. And what we're about to talk about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">right? How that watch is built is part of the reason why I decided to do something completely off menu,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">completely different from what I am accustomed to doing because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I choose and maybe we'll get more into this later, but I choose projects based on the density of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">learning, skill acquisition and relationship development, all of which should transcend that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">project even if it fails. And so the question of how do I win even if this fails is always present in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">my mind? So with this, let's dive into it. How do you build this watch? And rest assured, whether you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">make a very obviously sophisticated game or a very, very simple game, there's a lot of complexity or there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">can be in the process if you want it to work consistently. So I've learned so many things from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Milan. And he's such a sweetheart of a guy and such a polymath. I mean, he'd worked on the original,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">on the Xbox, on Halo, on entirely new genres of games. He's just, I've seen him make entirely new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">types of games that have not existed in the world before. I mean, but he comes out of video games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">He comes out, well, let's see, what does he come out of? I mean, he comes out of so many different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">places. It's hard to slap a clean label on him, which I like. I remember I asked him to send me his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">bio and I was like, I don't even know what to do with this. And I was like, okay, I like this guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And he cannot help himself but create games. And also, and I'll get into the kind of the process in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">second, but games are fundamental to human life past a certain rung on Maslow's hierarchy of needs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right? I think we, I'm sure you and I could talk about this forever. So it's like you are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're listening to this podcast, there are many games you are playing in life with rules,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with stakes, maybe with a quitting time, whether you're aware of them or not. So studying games helps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you kind of peer behind the curtain to see the games everywhere around you and to choose better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">games also. Okay. Process wise, what did I learn? Well, number one, there are a hell of a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">different types of games, right? You can have magic type games where you're building decks, where you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">collecting cards. You could have a D and D role playing game, very, very, very, very complicated and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">involved. Then you have all the way over on the other side, you have some very seemingly, at least when it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">done right, simple to learn games. And what I realized, at least for me, was number one, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">deciding on the direction was the most challenging part as a first time game designer, because I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">involved in every single step of the process, which I'm sure slowed things down for them. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">10 minutes of trying to prototype is worth 10 hours of talking. That's something you learn very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly. And what does a prototype look like for a game like this? Yeah, I'll tell you for a game like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">this. Yeah. We applied a bunch of constraints. So I started with and in conversations, we did a number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">sprints, Elan and I, friends of mine, just as testers, right, as players. And we're trying all sorts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">different original games, then we're looking at potentially taking an easier path, which would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">taking, say, the game that led me to Elan Poetry for Neanderthals, creating a variation of that with new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">rules or a twist on the rules. And ultimately wanted a few things to be true. Because I played,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">for instance, chess with my brother, my brother is very mathematically inclined. I'll leave it at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But he always will beat me at chess. And that's annoying, number one. Number two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">he also wants me to suffer through going all the way to the end to get knocked off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">even if I see very quickly, oh, I just painted myself into a corner. I'm doomed. This is checkmate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted to be closer, meaning the game that I would make closer to backgammon or poker than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">chess in the sense that there is a chance for a weaker player to win if they have some good luck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And that also came from playing magic with a couple of friends of mine. And I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">this sucks, not because magic sucks, but because they would always beat me, always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, well, this isn't fun. I don't want to play this game again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a constraint. And then thinking of other constraints, like, well, what can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">prototype quickly? Cards. We could also use chits, meaning something you use to keep track of lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And we played around with a bunch of other accessories. But here's what the first prototype</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">looked like. We were doing a sprint, the last sprint, because we had tried sprints over the course of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">nine to 12 months. And we hadn't found something yet. Because for me, if I'm going to put my name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">on something, man, I need to be willing to live with this forever, which means it's got to be something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm excited to talk about, which is a high bar for me. And then we decided, look, we're both very busy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We haven't found something yet. Let's make this the last sprint. We either commit, well, we do commit to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">either finding something and running with it, or calling a spade a spade. And we're just grasping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in the dark here. And it's probably better for us to focus on other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And what are you physically using in a sprint?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll tell you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'll tell you. So the sprint, first of all, just looks like us walking around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this happened to be in Toronto.

So the question was no longer, what tabletop games</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">have you really liked?

What are the games you've liked?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Any kind of game.

And I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you know what, this is embarrassing to say, but if my friends and I have had a few drinks, even if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't playing rock, paper, scissors, we really enjoy it. These are smart friends. And I was expecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">an eye roll, but instead they're like, okay, let's roll with it. Like what, what, what does that look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">like? And I was like, well, what could it look like in a group of say four or five people? And let's say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we're only using cards, but we could add in some dice because I wanted that chance opportunity for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">weaker player to win. So I was attached to dice because I love like the 20 sided die out of D and D. I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">really wanted to use the D 20. So D 20, I really want to use the D 20. Now in retrospect, I'm glad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that we applied more constraints to use only cards because for instance, exhibit a tariffs. Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">adding, adding these components, that's a lot of cost. And we had this kernel of an idea and we basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">raced back to the kitchen table and had a bunch of blank decks of cards could just be index cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Doesn't matter markers and a bunch of accessories kind of looks like a craft shop in a launch house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You can imagine he's got every possible little knickknack you can use for making games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And Ken and Alana and I just sat down and started making cards and tried a bunch of things and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">literally had a V1 for like version one ready to play test in 15 minutes and then tried it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Barely worked, but there was like something.

So we were able to iterate sitting at a table</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">with blank cards over and over and over again for a few hours. And by the end of that weekend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to rely on Alon in, in, in the sense of pattern recognition and his taste sensors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">his kind of water feel for games, because I felt like there was something there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">but Alon has seen hundreds and thousands of games, right?

And I was like, what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">what do you think here?

And I think it was like a, an eight or a nine with the possibility of getting it higher. And I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">like, okay, if that's true, let's pause for now. Cause we were wiped out, you know, after play testing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and especially this game also, if you want to, if you have trouble getting to sleep and you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">get to sleep, like play a couple of rounds of this before bed and it might just be easier to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I say that as a lifelong insomniac.

Was the motions in the beginning, like the initial play testing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">was it closer to rock, paper, scissors? Like at first, was it just, Hey, we have different hand motions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the details.

So I'm like, tell you, let me tell you all about skiing. Right. Here's what you got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to know when you're jumping off a cornice. It's like, what have you, you know, but, but keeping all that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">mind, big grain of salt. I have learned a lot. I've taken a lot of notes. I've documented everything. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">here's what I would say.

So you just throw a lot against the wall. So we tried tons of stuff. And what Alana</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is very good at doing is, and I'm, I would say I'm not terribly good at this is brainstorming and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">testing without too much judgment, right? So leave the editor aside, right? And no matter how harebrained,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">how boring, try everything.

So in the beginning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">there were a lot of gestures, for instance, that we ended up pulling out later. Example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">anything that's kind of not suitable for work, which we're very reliable at getting laughs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're going to distribute at Walmart and target where you want to, chances are you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have to yank some of those out. And similarly, some of the cards had people standing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">up from a table to do something. Well, if you have somebody at the table who can't do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you've just run into a big problem, right? So yanking those out. Now later you can have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">expansion packs and you can have print to play PDFs and all that stuff, which I plan on doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was a lot of vetting. Now, once it goes back to Exploding Kittens headquarters and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">playing it internally with employees, then they have an entire system for play testing. They have an entire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">very refined system for play testing. And at that point, we also were creating spreadsheets with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple tabs of different gestures, which have corresponding words. So you can change the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">gesture, you can change the word, you can change both. And we had a ranking system for everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just had hundreds of these things. And what's the data to rank them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So there was a, there was a, as I remember it, there was a one to three ranking system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And one was, this isn't interesting at all.

There were a lot of questions around like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">how many kind of laugh out loud cards should you have?

And in addition to that, there are some decisions to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">be made about just, hopefully this doesn't sound boring, but deck construction, like there are 66</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. Why on earth 66 versus 86 versus 36? All of that revolves around a combination of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">variety. Things are color coded because you can play with people's brains in weird ways once you add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">colors. So a certain amount of repetition with colors, deciding which cards to replicate. And it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and it comes down to a lot of probability, right? Like how often do you want certain cards to show up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and over many, many games, what do you observe and mathematically, what should you see? Which then feeds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">into questions like, for instance, initially we had the game produced where you do what you do with every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">game. You shuffle the deck, right? Yeah. But if you have the gesture cards or action cards, they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">salamanders on them. You can explain why they're salamanders on them. There's a good reason for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But the, then you have the action cards, then the coyote cards are all grouped together initially. And when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you would shuffle, you wouldn't get, most people don't shuffle very well. If you just do a riffle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">shuffle, it doesn't actually mix the deck that well. So they would end up with these solid groups of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">identical cards that doesn't work very well. So they're seeing this in play testing, like the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">are shuffling not well and they're getting like six salamanders in a row. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Or six coyote cards or whatever. So then you go back to the manufacturing and manufacturing cards is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">surprisingly challenging. Like the, the actual manufacturing facilities are gigantic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They are huge. And there are very, they're relative to many other types of games or things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you could produce. A few, relatively few of these manufacturers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">They're in China at high volume. Yeah. A lot, a lot. Most of them are in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And same as book printing, basically the same as book printing. And what you can do is off the line,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you can manufacture a shuffled deck. So you can indicate what type of composition you want the deck to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">have as a quote unquote shuffled deck. So then when people pull it out of the box, they have a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">good first time out of box experience. It's so important. It's like if the first two rounds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">whiff, or they're just meh, that is going to crush you. And particularly since it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing's cheap, right? It's half the price of a movie ticket, basically in the US, right? It's 9.99</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in or around, around $10, right? So if they play twice and doesn't totally work, it doesn't make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">them laugh. Are they going to play again? Maybe, maybe not. So you need the out of box experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to be really good. So the amount of time that you spend on the instructions also play testing the hell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">out of that, because once you do the internal testing, then you can go out to families and other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">people you've recruited to play test. And this is also, there's so many parallel parallels with tech</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and any type of product really, I think direct to consumer, but it could be applied anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Where if, if for instance, I think usertesting.com might still be around. I'm sure there are better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">tools now. But back in the day, it's like, if you want somebody to try signing up for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">software as a service on a website, you could ask them, what did you find confusing? How was it? Or you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">could just do a screen capture with a video and watch the facial expressions and see where they pause and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">take too much time. Yeah. So similarly with play testing a game, you don't want to just ask somebody,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">what did you think? And have a list of seven questions. Do you want video of them playing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, how long does it take certain parts of the game to transpire? Are there, are there huge pauses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">where people get gummed up? Where do they laugh versus where do they report they laugh? Right? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">these are, these are often things that have huge discrepancies. So suffice to say, to figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">a simple game is not so simple. And it has given me so much more appreciation. It's kind of like if you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">for instance, I'll give people a recommendation. Like I love drawing. I've done, I was very involved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">with all the artwork for every aspect of this game and did a lot of hand sketching and, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have somebody take you, let's just say a nature guide, take you on a tour somewhere around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">your house and introduce you to all the tree species, usually easier to start with trees versus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">general plants. Right? So you get maybe like in most places in North America, half dozen trees, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And now when you walk through the forest on your usual hike, you're just going to see things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">completely differently. Yeah. Like the fidelity, it's like, boom, things suddenly it's 3d instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">green trees, your labels change. And with your labeling change, your reality changes. And the same thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">happens to me now. If I see other games, I'm like, Oh my God, this is so smooth. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">simple for me as the user, right? It's like, if you open any product, let's just say a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">well-designed Apple product, cause most people had that experience and you're like, Oh my God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to get the, to get the AirPods paired to my phone and to do this and this is so easy. And then you compare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that with like, I'm going to throw them under the bus, but buying like a brother printer and you're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">like an hour and a half year later, you're like, what does it take in God's name to get this thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">on wifi? So I can, what is this wifi button about? Like there's a feature that no one has ever used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">this like auto connect protocol that yeah. So you can have this, you can have the same experience of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">game where you read the instructions. You're like, I have no idea what this means. Um, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to answer your question, I suppose, yes, there's, there's a lot that goes into it. And then also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">there are things that you can do that translate or can transfer from other places. So for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I used a bunch of websites and there are a million of them, but I think in Tel Aviv is one pick food.com</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">is another where, you know, I created like, I don't know, we created six to eight variations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">of this box in terms of the cover art, right. And then split tested it by serving it to different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">demographics and having them select their favorites, meaning one out of two at a time. And then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">winner would proceed to be compared against the next variation. And we did a ton of split testing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And just like I did the Google AdWords way back in the day to test for our work and the subtitle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you can where possible test with a few hundred bucks, you can get great signal. Not always,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but often you can with this.

Did you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">predict that or are you surprised?

I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">know what it is, but from a visual perspective, I think I'm, I'm just maybe a little more acute than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of folks.

Are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5324" target="_blank">01:28:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">changing?

What's your read on what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5327" target="_blank">01:28:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">happening in this industry? What's your relationship to it? Like, is it still going to be this great refuge for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5332" target="_blank">01:28:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">people like semi-introverted creative people like us?

So I found myself getting pulled into the floats and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5354" target="_blank">01:29:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">jets of all sorts of things and then put out, and this is one of the benefits of having a blog, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5362" target="_blank">01:29:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">anyone can have a blog, but you put out a public policy, which depersonalizes saying no to a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5367" target="_blank">01:29:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of people. Cause you can just say, Hey, I put this up six months ago. I got to follow my advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5371" target="_blank">01:29:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause you have an interview show. So everyone is probably saying, yeah, can I come on that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5376" target="_blank">01:29:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. And so I put up, you know, some new rules for podcasting to keep it interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5381" target="_blank">01:29:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that and explain, it's like, okay, here are the rules I'm going to follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5384" target="_blank">01:29:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was actually literally just having a conversation with one of my, uh, employees who's like the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5391" target="_blank">01:29:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the COO producer of editorial handles a lot of the podcast logistics and we had a possible guest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5398" target="_blank">01:29:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">great guest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5399" target="_blank">01:29:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">but a list celebrity and has been on before amazing conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5408" target="_blank">01:30:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but the rule that I set in that new blog post was I'm not doing book launches anymore. I won't be one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5413" target="_blank">01:30:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of 20 podcasts that come out the same week and because it's, it seems redundant. And what I will do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5422" target="_blank">01:30:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">though, like if I'm going to consider any book I need to, I need to record and publish three months ahead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5430" target="_blank">01:30:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">publication. And that rules out a million people because they don't have the necessarily the forethought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5438" target="_blank">01:30:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to do that or they missed the post or whatever, but I can still point to it. And in this particular case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5443" target="_blank">01:30:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this is, this is an amazing guest who is incredibly good in conversation and at telling stories on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5451" target="_blank">01:30:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">podcasts. I mean, a plus plus plus, but they were definitely not going to do me any favors. So it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5457" target="_blank">01:30:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have been at the same time as everybody else. And I said to my producer, I just said, look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5460" target="_blank">01:31:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">if I show people that I am not following my own rules, no one's going to respect my rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5467" target="_blank">01:31:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And rightly so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5468" target="_blank">01:31:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're like, look, you had, you had Brad Pitt on during the F1 launch, like everyone else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5473" target="_blank">01:31:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So like now you can have me on the talk about my ebook, whatever it is.

So another one was, for instance, I want to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5502" target="_blank">01:31:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a barbell approach to most guests on the show, most guests on the show, which is sort of everybody knows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5509" target="_blank">01:31:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">them or almost no one knows them. Right. You're trying to stay away from like the, the very highest point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5515" target="_blank">01:31:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of the, of the bell curve distribution there. And these are kind of arbitrary in a sense, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5524" target="_blank">01:32:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that's rules. And sometimes there is no perfect line that you can point to. So you have to pick a line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5532" target="_blank">01:32:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">This is true with moral judgments also and ethics, right? Like sometimes it seems arbitrary, but often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5539" target="_blank">01:32:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it's always going to be arbitrary. So you must pick a line so that you can make decisions. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5544" target="_blank">01:32:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, it's, it's a hell of a thing. Podcasting, I think will continue to be a refuge. If you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5552" target="_blank">01:32:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to play in the major leagues using video as a growth engine, then there are a lot of compromises compared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5560" target="_blank">01:32:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to what you are, you and I are accustomed to doing.

I'm also creating something before I do any management, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=5953" target="_blank">01:39:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">making before you manage for me psychologically, psycho emotionally, huge, huge thing.

So there's, there's an annual various annual fees and so on, but they handle all of my bill pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPW8u9zX0A&t=6484" target="_blank">01:48:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They handle all of my effectively bookkeeping.
