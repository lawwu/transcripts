Arguably, it's actually harder with Gen AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">than it was before, whether that is using Gen AI to build it or using Gen AI within your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're trying to talk about here is some techniques that you can use to build applications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly, but also somewhat more safely than you might do otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a strong believer that type safety is one of the really important parts of that.

Nothing I'm going to say here on what an agent is is controversial. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reasonably well accepted now by most people as a definition of an agent. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">image here is from Barry Zhang's talk at AI engineer in New York in February. This is his definition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or the anthropic definition of what an agent is now being copied by us, by OpenAI, by Google's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">ADK. I think generally the accepted definition of an agent. This, although very neat, doesn't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">make any sense to me. This, however, does make sense. So what they say is that an agent is effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">something that has an environment, there are some tools which may have access to the environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">there is some system prompt that describes to it what it's supposed to do, and then you have a while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">loop where you call the LLM, get back some actions to run in the tool, run the tools, that updates the state,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you call the LLM again. There is, however, even in his whatever it is, six line pseudocode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a bug, which is there is no exit from that loop. And sure enough, that points towards a real problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which is that it is not clear when you should exit that loop. And so there are a number of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">things you can do. You can say when the LLM returns plain text rather than calling the tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that is the end. Or you can have certain tools, which are kind of what we call final result tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which basically trigger the end of the run. Or if you have models like OpenAI or Google, which have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">structured output types, you can use that to end your run. But it's not necessarily trivial to work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">out when the end is. So enough pseudocode. Let me run a real minimal example of Pydantic AI. So this is a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">simple Pydantic-based model with three fields. And then we're going to use Pydantic AI to extract</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">structured data that fits that person schema from unstructured data, this sentence here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here, obviously, to fit this into onscreen, this is a very, very simple example. But this could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a PDF tens of megabytes. Well, probably not tens of megabytes necessarily in context, but like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely enormous documents. And this schema is very simple, but this could be an incredibly complex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">nested schema. Models are still able to do it. And sure enough, if we go and run this example and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">gods of the internet are with us, sure enough, we get the Pydantic model printed out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of you will notice that this example is simple enough that we don't actually need an agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or this loop. We're doing one shot, we make one call to the LLM, returns the structured data, we call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">under the hood, we call a final result tool, Pydantic AI performs validation, and we get back the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But we don't have to change that example very much to start seeing the value of the agentic loop. So here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm being a little bit unfair to the model. I've added a field validator to my person model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It says the date of birth needs to be before 1900. And obviously, the actual definition here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is abstract. It doesn't define which century we're talking about. You would obviously, the model will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for the most part, assume '87 is 1987. We'll then get a validation error when you do the validation. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that's where the agentic bit kicks in. Because we will take those validation errors and return them to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">model basically as a definite and say, please try again, as I'll show you in a moment. And the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is then able to use the information from the validation error to try again. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if you were trying to do this case in production, you would add a doc string to the DOB field saying it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">must be in the 19th century. But there are definitely cases where models, even the smartest models, don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">pass validation. And being able to use this trick of returning validation errors to the model is a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">effective way of fixing a lot of the simplest use cases. So if we run this, you see we had two calls to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini here. And if I come and open-- the other thing you'll see in this example is we instrumented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this code with Logfire, our observability platform, so we can actually go in and see exactly what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see our agent run. We had two calls to the model, in this case Gemini Flash. And if we go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and look at the exchange, you can see what's happened here. So I'll just try and make it big enough that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">can see it. We first of all had the user prompt to the description. It called the final result tool, as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">might expect. The date of birth being 1987. We then responded. The tool response was validation error,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">incorrect, please try. And then we add on the end, please fix the error and try again. And sure enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it was then able to return correctly, call the final result tool with the right date of birth and succeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. I've got five minutes. I feel like I'm in one of those. See how fast I can go. I'm on the wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">window, am I? I am. Here we are. I think the other thing that's worth saying here, even if I don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that much time, is if you take a look at this example, I talked about type safety. The way that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this under the hood. Agent, because of the output type, is generic. In this case, person. And so we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">can-- when we access result.output, both in typing terms, it's an instance of person. And a runtime will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">guaranteed from the Pydantic validation that it will really be an instance of person. So if I access here.name,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">all will be well. If I access first name, we suddenly get a validation. We get a runtime. We get the nice error</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">from typing, saying this is an incorrect field. So that's the kind of very beginning of the value of static typing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of our typing support. We go a lot further. You will have seen, or some of you might have noticed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a second generic on agent, which is the depths type. And so if you register tools with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">agent, they-- you-- we can have type safe dependencies to tools, which I will show you in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other thing you will notice is missing from this example is any tools. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">let's look at an example with tools. If I open this example here, we have-- this is an example of memory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">long-term memory in particular, where we're using a tool to record memories and then another tool to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">able to retrieve memories. So you'll see we have these two tools here, record memory and retrieve memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Tools are set up by registering them with the agent.tool decorator. But this is where the typing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">as I say, gets more complex. Now you will see that we've set depths type when we've defined the agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so our agent is now generic in that depths type. The return type is string because that's the default.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we-- when we call a tool decorator, we have to set the first argument to be this run context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to parameterize with our depths type. And so when we access context.depths, that is an instance of our--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of our depths data class that you see there. And if we access one of its attributes, we get the actual type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we change this to be int, let's say, suddenly we get an error saying we've used the wrong-- the wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">type. So we get this guarantee that the type here matches the type here, matches the attributes you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">access here. And then when we come to run the agent, we need our depths to be an instance of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">depths type. So again, if we gave it the wrong type, we would get a typing error saying you're using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong type. And as far as I know, we're the only agent framework that works this hard to be type safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is quite a lot of work on our side. I'll be honest. There's a little bit of work on your side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. And it's not necessarily as trivial to set up. But it makes it incredibly easy to go and refactor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your code. And yeah, we run this here. And we give it the-- I'm pretty sure I don't have Postgres running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I have Docker running? I don't know if I have time to make that work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I will-- that's Docker running. I'll just try and run this very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Docker run. Hopefully that is enough. If I now come and run this example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what you will see is it successfully failed. Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I will try one more time and see if I get lucky. I don't know quite what was going on there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, and I have no idea. Well, we can look in Logfire and see what happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to make it fail. I promise you I hadn't set that up to fail the first time to demonstrate the value of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">observability, but maybe it can help here. So if you look this first time, we--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">our first agent run, you'll see that we used the tool call record memory. The user's name is Samuel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it returned finished. And then the second time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see that the-- when it did retrieve memory, where it called the-- that tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the parameter or the argument it gave was your name, which was not-- is not contained within the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">query the previous time. We're just doing a very simple I like here. So your name is not a substring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of user's name is Samuel. And so that's why it failed that time. So this has turned into a very useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">example of where Logfire can help. And if we look at the-- that second time, you'll see user's name is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Samuel. And then when it-- when it ran the agent, it just asked for name. Name is obviously a substring of--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of the user's name is Samuel. And so it was able-- it got the response, user's name is Samuel, and therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">succeeded. The other thing we get here is, like, obviously, we get this tracing information. So we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">see how long each of those calls took. And we also get pricing on both aggregate across the whole of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_LRtAomJCs&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the trace and individuals' bands. I am told that I am running out of time. So thank you very much.</span></div></div></body></html>
