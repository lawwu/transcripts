Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. Today is July 7, 2014. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets. And on today's show, the question that we will be dealing with is, with the market at an all-time high, should I wait for the market to go down to invest in stocks? Stay with us. Today we deal with one of my favorite questions, which is exactly what I'm going to be talking about today. Today we deal with one of my favorite questions, which is exactly what I'm going to be talking about today. Should I wait for the market to go down to invest in stocks? And with today being July 7, 2014, let's see, as I read this right now, I'm recording at 2.09 p.m. today, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to Google Finance, is at 17,023 points. And in case you didn't pay any attention to investment news over the weekend, closed at an all-time record high on Thursday, last Thursday. Before the 4th of July holiday, at 17,000 points. And so anytime you read, and the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ also are doing and have done very well. But the Dow is what captured all the news over the weekend. So anytime that we are dealing with market high points, we get to deal with the questions of, what should I do with my money because of the market high? And today, I'm going to set you free. My goal of today's show is to set you free from most of the market commentary and to set you free from the market commentary. I'm going to talk about when it matters and when it doesn't matter, and how you can figure out what applies to you. So stick with us for that show. Before we begin, a couple of quick announcements and updates on the show. First of all, thank you for listening. I am starting to see several of you listen more and more, and I really appreciate it. I want you to know that I appreciate each of you who is listening. It means the world to me. I love to teach. I love to teach this stuff. I love to talk about this stuff. And I just really appreciate every single one of you. one of you who takes time out of your day to spend time with me. I know that I can go on for a long period of time sometimes, and I know that if you're listening to all of the shows or for the full length of the shows, that you are investing a substantial amount of your time. And my hope is that this investment will pay off for you in untold multiples, in spades as the saying goes. I hope that you receive untold multiples of your investment of time here with me. And I hope that day by day, as I start to learn how to do this a little bit better, I hope that day by day I can bring you quality information that's really going to make a substantial difference in your life. This week is going to be our first full week of doing the show. So last week we launched on Tuesday. We did three shows, one on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I was planning to record a Friday show and sat down to do it, and actually it was about 20 minutes in, and it just fell flat. And I didn't feel it was good, so I hit delete, stopped the recording. I hit delete and went off with my family and enjoyed the Fourth of July holiday weekend, and I hope that you did as well. But today being Monday, we're going to release this show. I would like to get on kind of a flow of weekly shows. I don't want to box myself into a specific schedule of this is what it's always going to be, but in my mind I'd like to do a couple of interview shows per week. I'd like to do some current events commentary. I'd like to do some teaching on some financial planning topics, and I'd like to answer your questions and listen to your feedback and just talk about it. So I'm going to do that. I'm going to do some teaching on some financial planning topics, and I'm going to talk through the issues with you. I really want to engage you, the audience, in the show. Still working on getting the technology worked on to do the interviews. I could do an interview, obviously. I've done some in the past, but the problem is I'm trying to get a little bit better audio, and I'm having some computer issues that I'm working on to get my better microphone and the recorder working with Skype. So I've ordered a piece of gear that should be here, and I'm hoping this will help me. I've reached out to a couple people to try to help me with... I'm not such a tech guy, but I'm not such a tech guy. I'm not such a techie. So I'm trying to get that fixed, and as soon as we get that fixed, I've got a lot of people that I would like to bring you some exposure to. Some of them I've spoken to. Some of them I need to reach out to them as well. But I'll bring you some technology... Excuse me, some interview shows just as quickly as possible. In the meantime, on Friday, I'm hoping to do a listener question show, and so please go ahead and send me a question. In the future, I'd like to get a voicemail feedback line set up to be able to send in those, but I haven't quite got that taken care of yet. So in the meantime, send me an email if you've got a question or something that you've been dying to ask a financial planner at joshua at radicalpersonalfinance.com, and I will incorporate those into the show. I'm sure I will go out, and in order to supplement, since we're still kind of going through the process of getting the word out there, I'll go out and try to deal with maybe some FAQs, some frequently asked questions that I've often heard over time, and maybe I'll go through and look at a couple of my favorite forums, internet forums, if I can find some questions that people are asking. But I thank you just for being here at the beginning. Still working on getting relisted, getting listed in iTunes and whatnot. I had submitted a feed previously, and so you may get that feed coming in, but then when I took the show down, I had to delete that feed and tried to get the new feed in iTunes, and I've been working on that over the weekend. So I hope to be back relisted in iTunes. If you have a problem with the feed, if the shows disappear, please go in, check in iTunes, or whatever podcast directory that you're listening to, and resubscribe. I'm adjusting, again, I'm adjusting a couple of feeds, so should be there in a day or two. Love it. Love it if you tell someone about the show. Probably best to wait until we're listed in iTunes, but would love it if you would tell somebody about the show. And then also, as soon as we're listed in iTunes, I would appreciate any reviews. Good, positive, great. Tell me, Joshua, you're doing a great job. That's awesome. Tell me, Joshua, you're doing a horrible job. Love that. And tell me, Joshua, you're doing a mediocre job. That's fine as well. I will read all of those and appreciate each and every one of them. There will be a link in the show notes, which, by the way, I noticed that iTunes has just made a change with their, I use the Apple podcast catcher, the one that's just native for the iOS devices, and they've made a change where now they're allowing hyperlinks. So if you'll check the show notes, which the way you do that is if you're listening on an iOS device, just click the, press the logo, and it'll pop to the show notes. And at the bottom of these show notes, there will be a link to leave an iTunes review, and would love it if you'd leave a review. That would be great and hugely appreciated. You know, certainly finding, still working to find my voice. I'm pretty challenged with the daily amount of what needs to be done for the show and then also for all the other projects that I have going on in addition to the show. But I'm here for the long term. I'm committed to this. I told my wife, I said, I'm going to do a thousand episodes. So if I can't, if I can't, I'm going to do it for a thousand episodes. And if five or 10 people listen, that'd be great. I'll work to it. I'll feel really good about sharing the content with five or 10 people. I'm hoping that a few more than that will tune in over time. But I certainly am still just working to find my voice. And, you know, I was listening to one of the shows from last week and was a little disgusted with the number of ums and ahs. So I'm working today to do a better job with that. Some days I, it's so easy to feel like, well, there are other people that are better qualified for this than me. There's other people that do a better job with it, but I just don't see anybody doing it. And the way that I think it should be done, and just giving good information, talking through things, exploring the nuance to help people be educated. I just don't see anybody doing it. And so I'm going to do it. And I thank you for staying with me along the ride. So let's jump in. Dow hit 17,000 points, closed at 17,000 points. It previously hit 17,000, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at over 17,000 points on Thursday, right before the holiday. And anytime you have a new market high, this was a new market high coming up from the previous market high. I think it was 16,000 hit a few times. I don't pay much attention to it on a daily, or even on a weekly or monthly basis. But I think it hit 16,000, which was another record previously. So closed at 17,000. And here are the four article titles that you can always predict when general stock markets hit a new record high. Number one article is stocks have more room to run. The bulls are continuing. And the number two is stocks are going to go down. There's a bubble. And the bears are going to... The bears are going to win. The bulls are stupid. Number three is here's why you should still invest, even though stocks are high. And the number four is here's why you should not invest when stocks are high. And these are the four articles that you're constantly going to read. So this morning, just for fun, I popped over to Google News, and I plugged in stocks, and I plugged in a couple of words that would make these articles pull up for me. And here are the articles, each of them written as predictably so. Here are all... All of the articles. So the first one, stocks have room to run. Today, excuse me, updated July 4, Wall Street Journal headline. Stocks are picking up speed. Byline, or excuse me, the, I don't know what this is called, sub headline. Dow topped 17,000 for the first time, and many investors bet the five-year bull market has more room to run. And you go down and you read through here, and you see, well, the market's going to run. Next one here is a CNBC article. And so, here would be, this one is from July 3, Thursday. So this was actually right before the 17,000. And this one is titled, Why U.S. Stocks Aren't Overvalued Yet, written by Leslie Schaefer for CNBC. And, again, normal article. I feel bad for the news organizations that have to constantly produce article after article, which eventually just really doesn't seem like it says much over time. So there's your positive news. Stocks aren't overvalued. Stocks are going to be overvalued. Stocks are going to run. And now let's go and look at the bears. So my favorite gloom and doom website is Zero Hedge. You can always count on reading some good gloomy forecasts over there. So go over to ZeroHedge.com, and I just flipped through the first couple of pages here, just from over the weekend, all the articles that they posted over the weekend. And this one is from July 7. Stocks tumble. Give up all the, quote, unquote, great jobs report gains. Here, nothing's cheap anymore, is the article. Day after, and here's the, it's a one-paragraph article. This is good. Day after day, we are bombasted with asset gatherers, academics, and status quo huggers demanding we BTFATH. I'm not sure what that, I got to look up that acronym. I don't know what that acronym is. Demanding we BTFATH as, quote, stocks are still cheap. Some have even deferred modestly to the old standby. Quote, stocks are fairly valued. In a last lame effort to save, what credibility they have left when they look themselves in the mirror. The fact is, no, stocks are not cheap. As we pointed out here, they are more expensive than at the peak of what Jim Bullard called an obvious bubble. Links to a separate article. However, still, the shrill call of stock picker's market rings out to encourage the placement of hard-earned savings into easily commissioned AUM, which stands for assets under management. The fact is, as the three charts below show, nothing is cheap. Nothing. There have never been so few, almost zero stocks, that are, quote, cheap based on historical valuations. Another one here, the one that the article linked to, stocks are officially more overvalued than during the last bubble peak. And here's another one of my favorites. It would load. Basically, the headline of this one is that current wealth is transitory and the risks of failing to act should not be overlooked. It should not be underestimated. So here are your pessimistic articles, all lined up for you. And then you can go on and you can search out the other articles of what should you do about it. So Wall Street Journal article, with stocks so high, should investors move to cash? Discussing that. And you can find these. Look for these over the next week or two. They're going to be everywhere. And this is just the ongoing trend of the investment market. Investment news that you read every single day, if you read it. So what on earth do you do about this stuff? Today, my goal is to set you free from the fear and worry of market highs and the fear and worry of the financial news, these kinds of articles. And the key to being free is personal education and understanding. Generally, people fear what they don't understand and what they're not confident in. But if you are well educated, and you're confident in the topic, and you're confident in what you're doing, you generally don't fear something. Imagine if you're a standard U.S. American person, you constantly spend a lot of time in the car, you drive every day, and you have no problem of driving down the interstate at 75 miles an hour. You have no problem with that. But imagine if you came from the proverbial jungles of wherever, and you'd never seen a car, and someone plopped you into a car at 75 miles an hour cruising down the interstate. That would be an extremely, extremely fearful scenario, right? I remember you read news articles about how people thought in the past when railroads were first being built up, how people thought that if you went over 35 miles an hour, that the human body couldn't handle going over 35 miles an hour. And now we say, well, there may be a limit somewhere, but we can certainly handle going hundreds and hundreds of miles per hour. And we seem to do well under that. So the first thing, in my opinion, to remember is that the news thrives on attention. If a news article cannot draw your attention, it doesn't work. News is news precisely because it's abnormal. If all the news did, if I were writing financial news articles, I would come every single day, the article would read something like this. Today, stock market prices wandered around the world, and nobody really knows because there are millions and millions of people, no one really, really knows why, because there are millions and millions of people involved in the market every day. And each one of them has their own individual goals, their own individual strategy, their own individual purposes. And there are so many, when you start looking at things, there are so many different things that can move prices, you start to just become numb to the whole thing. Now, I do want to be careful with what I'm saying. It does seem that certainly you can see impacts of major events, on markets. I wouldn't go so far as to say you can't see that. But remember, for every buyer, there's a seller. And that's one of the big ones. We'll come to that in a moment. But that's one of the big ones that people forget. For every seller, there's a buyer. So there's a counterparty in every single transaction. News, fear and greed sell. Fear and greed both are some of the most effective ways to sell. But fear actually sells more. People always do more to keep from losing, especially money, than they will to gain. And so anytime you can sell to fear, it's one of the most effective tactics. And so that's why you see people get this fearful frenzy and do stupid things. And this can be manipulated. And this is especially true in markets. And it's especially true when people don't truly understand markets. I should probably begin any discussion with markets, any discussion on markets, with the caveat that I don't have a market outlook. Well, actually, that's not quite true. I don't have any kind of short-term market outlook ever. And I am not a brilliant investment manager. And I personally think it matters very little. It matters very little what happens in the short term of any kind of market outlook. I do think that I do have a long-term market outlook. And I'm actually an eternal bull. And I'll explain why. I believe that over time, well-run financial markets will always, well-run companies will always increase in value. And the reason is that over time, people always improve their situation in the long term. There has never been a period of history at which it's been better to be alive than today. Period. There's never been a period of history at which we've had more advantages to us than today. And people will always work to improve the things in their lives, the things that they don't like. Now, that improvement is usually uneven. There may be up, up, up, down, down, up, up, down, up, up, up, up, down, down. But generally, the long-term trend is up. And the way that people do that is they work together. And in our system, we have a capitalistic-based system which rewards those who do better and improve the world with things called profits. Profits measured in the form of money. The people that work together, they form companies. And as those people work together to meet the needs of the market, they make a profit. And as they make a profit, they give that profit to their stockholders. And if the company is unprofitable, it'll close its doors and it will be replaced by somebody who's able to do it better, more efficiently, and to provide a better service. And that's always the way history has always been. And I've never found any rational reason to believe that it wouldn't always be like that in the future. Any history of the world, that I've ever been able to read through, illustrates that people always improve their situations over time. And companies and owners of companies accrue wealth. Now, there can be lots of hiccups. There may be a war. There may be a financial crash. There may be major economic problems. There always are. But even those times are tremendous opportunities for people. And so the key is to be able to identify those things when possible and take steps that are going to position, you know, I want to take steps that are going to position me to profit in the good times and in the bad times. And I believe that's done through sound financial planning. And I'll explain more a little bit about that within the context of this conversation in a few minutes. So with all of these articles, the problem is that all the fear articles are basically irrelevant to 85% of the general U.S. population. They're only relevant to less than 50% of the U.S. population. So you say, why that number? Well, it's because 85% of the general U.S. population doesn't own stocks. Now, you might be wondering how that's true because most people seem to own something, whether it's through the context of a corporate pension plan, such as a 401k or their IRA or a health savings account or something like that. But here's why. 85% of the public doesn't own stocks because 85% of the public doesn't invest in individual stocks. Only 15% of the public. Only 15% of the public does invest in individual stocks. And I'm citing for that Federal Reserve data. Feel free to check me out and fact-check me and make sure that I'm correct. So the market news is completely irrelevant to the 85%. And it's actually irrelevant to most of the other 15%. Because of the 15% who do own stocks, of those numbers, 20% of them own one company. So that's 8% of households. And 17.8% of those 15% are the U.S. population. And 53% of those 15% own between 2 to 9 companies. And so there's only a total of 3% in total of the U.S. population that owns greater than 10 individual stocks, 10 individual companies. And when you look at that data, you say, well, why would the Dow Jones Industrial Average at all-time high affect someone? That's 30 stocks. Why would that affect somebody that owns 2 to 9 firms? It doesn't, really. In one sense, it does. Of course it does, because you have a general trend. Yeah, I'm aware of that. But it doesn't affect their holdings. So this really affects about 3% of the U.S. population. And yet, you would think when you read an article or you see it on the front page of the news or it leads the evening TV news, you would think this affects everybody. It doesn't. Now, what about the people that invest through other things except through other vehicles, more than just individual stocks? Well, that's valid. And that would be about 50% of American families do own some kind of stock through a fund. Through some kind of fund. And that's going to be a major part of what we're going to talk about today. So I've come up with basically what I think are three ways to be three steps, three steps to set yourself free from the tyranny of the financial news. To understand, number one, the vast majority of people don't own stocks. They own other financial instruments, which have stocks, but they don't own stocks. And even the, it's only 50% of the people that do own, that don't own any kind of financial instrument containing stocks. So number one, understand, most people don't own stocks, and that probably includes you. Number two is then you have to understand your strategy. Understand the strategy of the people that you've hired to run those investment vehicles, whatever they are, and understand how that strategy might be affected by market movements. And then number three, you always need to make all decisions within the framework of your strategy. And that should take into account your personal goals and your personal fears, your personal comfort level with investments, your personal comfort level with volatility, with the ups and downs of market movements. And remember this, the stock market is not the only place to invest money. There's no reason why you can't open up a gas station or a string of gas stations in your own hometown. So maybe that's what you should be spending your money doing, or open up a gas station or open up a McDonald's franchise or a Dunkin' Donuts or start an internet company or build a welding company or start a house cleaning company or a construction company or a products and services company or a retailer. There are any number of things that can be invested in. Every single one of those things is just as valid as investing in stocks. However, publicly traded stocks do have their own advantages, and we'll talk a little bit about that. There's no such thing as a stock market in this way. The stock market is not, you know, something or someone. It's not an entity. It's not this entity that has a mind of its own. The stock market is just where people come together to buy and sell shares of their companies. And so they come together to trade little bits of paper, not paper anymore, little digits, that represent ownership in various companies, some large, some small, some local, some national, some international. And these are all traded together, and they're all traded together in a place we call the stock market. And so what the price of a stock represents is just literally the last price at which a trade happened between two parties. So if the stock is priced at $20 per share, all that information tells us is that the most recent trade happened at $20 per share, or that somebody is really ready to offer $20 a share for this price. And so if you don't like that price, don't take it. If you like the price, take it. And that's why we're talking about all trading is done based upon. It's done based upon whether one person values something more than they value the money, and the other person values the money more than they value the good. And we never know why people decide to trade. In all transactions, all financial transactions, each party is ultimately going to believe that they benefit more. So let's say that I go, and I'm looking to buy a pair of jeans. And I go down to the store, and the store has a pair of jeans, and they are offering the pair of jeans for sale. Well, if I want to buy the jeans, I have to value the jeans more than I value the money that I trade for the jeans. So let's say it's a $50 pair of jeans. I have to believe that by giving them my $50, I'm going to win. And they believe that by giving me their jeans and them getting the $50, they win. That's it. Every transaction is based upon that. So it's exactly the same in the world of stock market. So what we're saying is that one person values the company more than they value the money, and one person values the money more than they value the company. And so we never know why people decide to trade. Some may be obvious. There may be a large investor who comes on TV and says, here's why I'm trading this block of shares, and here's why I'm willing to sell them and accept the money. And then someone else may come on and say the opposite. Here's why I'm buying this large block of trades, large block of shares. And in today's world, with so much of the money institutionalized, where there's large companies and large institutions doing the transactions, then it becomes very challenging for these companies to make their trades anonymously. So oftentimes you do know. You do understand what a company's outlook is, and you do understand why people are buying and trading it. But it could be from everything from the latest earnings report, hurt expectations, or was below expectations, to the fact that maybe a father needed to pay for his daughter's wedding, and therefore he valued, the $50,000 that he could get for his General Electric stock, more than he valued owning the General Electric stock, because he wanted to pay for the wedding. Who knows? There are millions and millions of reasons why people own stocks and trade stocks. So remember that the majority of people don't own stocks. Let's assume you do. Well, let's talk about your strategy. And anytime you're going to be owning a stock, you should have some rationale for it. You should have some strategy. So you're probably doing some kind of analysis on the stock. So there are basically three major types of stock analysis, and there's always exceptions to everything. How's that for a blanket statement? There's exceptions to that. There's just about always exceptions to everything in the financial world. But in general, there's usually three different categories of stock research. One would be fundamental analysis. Number two would be quantitative analysis. And number three would be technical analysis. So fundamental analysis is usually, where you're looking at an individual company and you're giving a rating to that company based upon its individual business prospects. So if you were analyzing a company on the fundamentals, you might look through its operations. You might take a look at its balance sheet, at its finances. You might try to figure out what its future earnings would be. And so you'd read through their filings with the SEC. You'd read through any trade journals that talked about it. You'd read any industry interviews. You'd read any industry reviews with the management or kind of take a look through any kind of competitive reports that you could get access to. Maybe you would go to the company. Maybe you would visit its stores. So let's say that you wanted to invest in Chipotle, but you didn't understand why everyone was crazy about it. Well, you'd go to a Chipotle and see what the experience was. Maybe talk to a few people. That's all fundamental analysis. Now, in quantitative analysis, usually with quantitative analysis, you're taking a look and you're making a hypothesis. And so this hypothesis would be based on something that you've observed and you're trying to test it. So maybe you said that female CEOs of companies do better than male CEOs. And so you're going to go back and you're going to try to test your hypothesis and see that. Well, quantitative analysis, you're basically largely looking for, you're looking through a lot of data and you're trying to say, is this factor and this idea that I've picked up on going to, is this factor going to make a difference across a large variety of companies? And you're looking to test this out. The third area is technical analysis. So with technical, if you're doing technical analysis on a stock, then a technical analyst would basically say, you know, a stock price follows a certain pattern. And this pattern is largely based upon the irrational behavior of investors. So it's not so much about what the underlying company is doing, and it's more about what investors are actually believing about companies. So everyone jumps on, and then when it reaches a certain price point, then it jumps off. So a technical investor would call that a resistance level. And they'd say, oh, this stock is reaching a resistance level. At $20 per share, it looks like there's more sellers than buyers, and people aren't quite ready for this higher level. Or they might look and they say, well, at $15 a share, it seems to be kind of a support level. And so people, if it goes below $15, generally investors are willing to pay more. But this is all based, not upon any underlying assumption about the company. It's more based upon people's perception of the company. So if you were trading your portfolio, you would do it based upon that. And you would understand that none of these strategies involve what the Dow is doing, what the general market is doing. And each of them is specific either to an individual company or to a company in relation to the market or in relation to investor sentiment. So the only way that the Dow closing at 17,000 points matters, in this scenario, is if that is one of your, I don't know, maybe that's your support level or your resistance level for your technical trade. Now, maybe you are approaching it with the idea of, let's say you're a value investor. So you go through and you perform fundamental analysis on stocks and you say, well, based upon my fundamental analysis, I believe the intrinsic value of this company is $15 a share. Well, Dow 17,000 doesn't mean anything to you. You're looking at your company. Or maybe you're a technical investor and you're just, again, trading based upon those resistance levels and support levels. If maybe you're swing trading or day trading, well, in this situation, you're going to be just trading based upon movement and each and every day just moving based upon movement. It's really irrelevant which direction the movement is to you. And 17,000 is not that big a deal except maybe you say, well, we hit that and we're going to bounce back a little bit. That seems to be what's happened so far today. You got to understand your strategy. Now, those ideas were applicable to basically this tiny percentage of the U.S. general market. Most people own funds, not stocks. They own funds of stocks, not stocks directly. Well, in a fund of stock, it's even more important to understand what the strategy is. What is your portfolio built to do? So in your portfolio, you need to understand what investments are making up that portfolio. So let's say that you're a passive index, fund investor. Well, if you're a passive index fund investor, you need to understand the idea behind the efficient market hypothesis. And so the efficient market hypothesis basically would claim that the current stock price incorporates all known information about a company. Incidentally, you may find interesting, there's actually three forms of the efficient market hypothesis. So whenever you're reading something about the efficient market hypothesis, it's a good idea to try to understand what the efficient market hypothesis you are hearing about. And so the three versions would be what they call the weak form hypothesis, the semi-strong form hypothesis, and the strong form hypothesis. And the weak form hypothesis would basically say that stock prices already reflect all the information that you could pool by looking at the history of past prices or trends or trading volumes or interest by people shorting the stocker, things like that. And so the idea here is that all this past stock data is publicly available. So it's useless for you to try to look for a trend or something that's unexploited because all the data is available and it's practically free and so somebody's already exploited it. So if you see a good example would be, this would be the dogs of the Dow strategy. So someone who claimed the weak form hypothesis would say, well, this dogs of the Dow trading strategy, which goes and looks at these stocks and the Dow Jones Adjustable Average that don't meet these certain criteria that are the dogs of the Dow not doing well according to this criteria. I don't remember exactly off the top of my head what those criteria were. They would say, well, these are good companies to buy. Well, a weak form hypothesis, a believer in the weak form hypothesis would say, it's not really any point in doing that because now that anytime someone says dogs of the Dow, that has now been exploited to the point where there's no advantage to be gained in that situation. So don't even waste your time. Not even worth it. The semi-strong form hypothesis would say that all publicly available information regarding the prospects of a firm must already be reflected in the stock price. So that includes anything about past prices or any kind of fundamental information on how much money they're making or on new products or how good the management is or how much money they have and what their forecasts are or what their accounting practices are. That's all done. All investors have access to the information and it's free and costless to obtain. So therefore, there's no point in combing through earnings reports, trying to figure out whether the company is doing well or is going to do better in the future. There's no point. It's already been incorporated into the price of the stock. That would be the semi-strong form of the hypothesis. And I think most people, when they actually mention the efficient market hypothesis, they usually, in their mind, envisioning the semi-strong form. And then the last form would be the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. And this would say that stock prices reflect all information relevant to the firm, even including information only available to company insiders. And so that's a pretty, pun intended, strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. It would say that even if you were the president of the company and the accountant and you knew that you had some challenges, and you were meeting together, that the stock price already incorporates that information. So I think that that one's probably the most challenging to defend. But then again, you rarely find people that would say that. But that is the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. We won't go into insider trading. We're going to ignore that for now. And again, not saying that this is true. This is not true. My personal opinion on it is that it's important and very valid. And yet, I think there are exceptions. But again, I'm not necessarily the guy to pick on that from. It doesn't line up well. My beef with it is that it wouldn't incorporate behavioral economics. And I think you certainly-- in my opinion, you certainly see times where there are things that are undervalued and overvalued based upon the behavioral herd mentality. But that's me. And again, don't do anything with that information. That's just anything-- that's my opinion. I'm not going to go into too much detail on that topic. But go back to understand your strategy. So assume you're a passive index fund investor. Well, necessarily, a passive investing is based upon the premise of the efficient market hypothesis. And that premise would say that the current stock price, at least the semi-strong version, incorporates all known information about the company. Well, in that situation, if you reach Dow 17,000 or whatever the S&P 500 is, if you say, well, this is the actual price of the company, assume for a moment that price-- one thought incidentally. This is a little bit debated. But here's the way I think of price. The price is people's expectation of all of the future earnings of a company based upon their acceptable discount rate. And so if you're going to buy a house from me, a rental house, then what you pay for that rental house basically would say, if I have my cost, and I have my income from the house, and I take that income, and I push it forward, and I include the cost of repairs to the house, the expenses, and I include my terminal value of the house-- so whatever I think I could sell the house for based upon my future price, and whatever I could sell the house for in the future-- then I take all of those cash flows, and I back them up for today, and I say, what's the total value of all the cash flows I can accept from this property, and then what rate of return do I require from my investments? And that's how you would arrive to set the price. Well, investors in a company don't and shouldn't necessarily do anything different if they're following a strategy that's not based upon the movement in stock price, but rather that's based upon the actual company's performance. So that's all the price is. And so you would say, well, whatever the price is at Dow 17,000, that's fine. That's the exact price. This incorporates all of the-- I mean, the actual price is the same as the actual price at Dow 17,000. So that's the exact price. And so you would say, well, whatever the price is at Dow 17,000, that's fine. But what I would say is, well, what's the price? Well, the price is the same as the actual price. So what I would say is, well, what's the price? Well, the price is the actual price. So what I would say is, well, what's the price? Well, the price is the actual price.

But on the other hand, if I surfed over to Warren Buffett, and he said, what, the world is going to fall apart, I would say, whoa, what's going on here? Is that some people just-- you have these underlying biases and these underlying assumptions that influence your philosophy. So try to understand what those things are. Try to understand what your biases and assumptions are, and then make a plan that's rational within that context. So as with all things in financial planning, the answer to should I buy stocks or should I invest at Dow 17,000, as with all things, the answer is based upon your situation. And the answer is, it depends. You got to look at your specific goals, your specific situation, and talk it through and think it through. But think it through from a comprehensive standpoint. Think it through and look for the areas where you're being irrational, and really research and understand your strategies. So that's it for today's show. Again, today was Monday, July 17-- excuse me, July 7. I hope you enjoyed the show. It's challenging to do these kinds of shows. And I'll tell you, it's most challenging to be out there on the record. It's a scary place to be when you're putting your ideas out there on the record. And I'm such a perfectionist that I see all the problems in everything that I say. And if I give my caveat to every caveat, then the show would be forever. So I've tried to avoid that, but that's a major challenge for me. Today's show is episode-- 14. Come by the show. It's RadicalPersonalFinance.com/14. Love to hear your thoughts and opinions on the show. Give me your feedback. Point out where I'm wrong. Would love to know that. As always, financial planning is intensely personal. Please go and talk with your own financial planner. And don't take your advice from some random guy on the internet. Take the information and then go and take a look at it in your own personal life. Hope today's been helpful and would love to hear from you. Have a great Monday, everybody. Thanks, everybody. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. And this one's done. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. special offers</p></div></body></html>
