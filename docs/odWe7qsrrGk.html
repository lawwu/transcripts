And then when you look at the demands on Social Security,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Medicare, forecasts are that both of those systems necessarily go bankrupt, unless there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">some extraordinary measures taken. And that seems to be a very kind of hot topic, golden goose that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can't be touched or debated. All of this seems to be largely ignored. And so much of the conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is around social issues in the United States, military issues, war, etc. When fundamentally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no gas in the tank. I guess the point of view I'd love to hear from you is how do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about that?

If we cut some spending,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll fix itself. It seems so core to me that the future of the United States is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">dependent on how we're going to manage this fiscal emergency that we're facing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, look, David, it's core to me, too.

First off, I think on the deficit and debt side, I learned about this after becoming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a prosecutor and having to come to New Jersey and inherit two problems immediately. We had a $2</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">billion short-term deficit for the last five months of the fiscal year that I inherited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we had an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget for the fiscal year starting July</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">1 of 2010. And I had to deal with both those things. And as you know, unlike the chart that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">was just shown, you don't get to run it up. You have to square it. And so, you know, I learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how hard it is and how ugly it's going to be for your popularity to do these things. So on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">first piece, on the $2 billion, we sat down, I refused to raise taxes, and we sat down and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">eliminated 683 individual programs completely and then swept every surplus from a school board in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the state. And the way we did that was we reduced their state aid by the amount they had in surplus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to get the $2 billion in balance. And then extended that into the next budget cycle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">kept all those cuts in place, which did some structural, you know, refiguring of the deficit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then made additional cuts after that. You know, I'd gotten elected with 48.5% of the vote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And after I did that, my approval ratings went down below 40 in my first six months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I knew was it was absolutely necessary because in our state, we were already overtaxed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and the idea of raising taxes again was not an option that was, to me, viable. So when you learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and you go through that process, and then you look at what we're dealing with federally, I think you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">realize three things right off the bat. One, it is an imperative that we need to reduce spending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">What it's doing to inflation and the long-term ability of the country to grow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it makes it absolutely necessary. Two, to me, kicking the can down the road is not an option</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because the problem's only gonna get worse, and it's going to begin to impact our ability to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">able to do some of the core things that government is supposed to do. And then third, that you've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to be willing to sacrifice popularity for results.

It won't be.

Because it happens, it's been my experience, it happens across budgets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">across disciplines. With that being said, I would say it happens in a number of different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, not doing zero-based budgeting contributes to that because people no longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">have to rationalize or justify the existence of a program.

So that's one way that it happens. Secondly, incompetence in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">administration. So people who are either purely incompetent in the job or alternative two is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are corrupt in the job.

Third way that I think it happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is extraordinary events that cause political overreaction.

And then politicians want to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like we're responding to it. And the way we're responding to it is we're going to spend x tens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds of billions more on this broad category of initiatives without really digging into whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that can be spent effectively that way or not. And then once it gets in there, for the reasons I gave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to you in the two examples before, it doesn't get out.

And then that's the way that stuff happens. So I think it's a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of a nutshell presentation on that for you.

Everybody will have the truth. If the Biden's are truly not guilty, that will be clearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6990" target="_blank">01:56:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">established now in this process. But if he was acting as an unregistered agent of these foreign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6996" target="_blank">01:56:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">governments, that is also going to come out. And if there were links between him and his father,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7001" target="_blank">01:56:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and communications, that's also going to come out. I think that he hasn't even been indicted on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7005" target="_blank">01:56:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">yet. Right? Yeah, I think it takes time. I think they will thoughtfully put it together. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7011" target="_blank">01:56:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not confident about it, given that they wanted to give him broad immunity on those charges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7015" target="_blank">01:56:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think no, but I think I think David Weiss is under such a microscope right now. The idea that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7020" target="_blank">01:57:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">he doesn't act conclusively here, I think would be a huge problem. And then the next president,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7024" target="_blank">01:57:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's Republican, will reopen it. So whatever happens here will need to be definitive. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7029" target="_blank">01:57:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">think the special prosecutor probably understands that at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7032" target="_blank">01:57:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go back to your impressions before we go down the Biden, Biden, Biden rabbit hole here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7037" target="_blank">01:57:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">What are your thoughts after two hours with Chris Christie, anything change in your outlook on him?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7043" target="_blank">01:57:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm curious, are you still team to Santa's all the way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7047" target="_blank">01:57:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so on Christie, I like talking to him more than I thought I was going to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7054" target="_blank">01:57:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he was easy to talk to, I think the two hours went by pretty quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7057" target="_blank">01:57:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he brought his energy level down to the right place for a podcast.

So I thought that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7073" target="_blank">01:57:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">positive.

Yeah, I think he really believes this. Yeah. Third, I took a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7113" target="_blank">01:58:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of tries by Chamath and then me to get him to say this, but he said he would not put Trump in jail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7119" target="_blank">01:58:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">He's too old for that.

Yeah, we should have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7127" target="_blank">01:58:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">asked him if he would pardon him if he was president.

But I commute his sentence. So he didn't have to spend time in jail. So I thought that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7136" target="_blank">01:58:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">new information.

However, Christie said he did it for idiosyncratic reasons. He loves his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7151" target="_blank">01:59:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">box of mementos.

I thought he broke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7421" target="_blank">02:03:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your heart there in a couple of places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7422" target="_blank">02:03:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">No, actually, I don't expect all candidates to line up with my belief system perfectly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7428" target="_blank">02:03:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, he's well spoken.

I'm looking for a moderate like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7434" target="_blank">02:03:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Freeberg. I think the existential crisis of the balance sheet is my top issue. I voted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7439" target="_blank">02:03:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Republican about 25%. And Democrats 75%. I'm literally a moderate and an independent and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7446" target="_blank">02:04:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right now, I really don't think Biden can be president or Trump. So that leaves me with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7451" target="_blank">02:04:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">RFK on one side. And it leaves me with Nikki Haley and Christie on the other side. And Nikki</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7458" target="_blank">02:04:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Haley and Christie are really into balancing the budget. And so I'm leaning towards voting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7462" target="_blank">02:04:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Republican, if those are the two candidates. Now, the thing that I think handicapping this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7468" target="_blank">02:04:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">election is not being talked about all that much, because we have the Trump Biden rematch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7474" target="_blank">02:04:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">taking while they are in the room is I don't know that Biden makes it to the starting line,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7478" target="_blank">02:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">nor do I think Trump makes it to the starting line. And so that changes everything. And who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7482" target="_blank">02:04:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">knows what percentage chance that is, I don't think any of us can give it a perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7485" target="_blank">02:04:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">handicap. But let's say that is the case. Then I think it's, you know, there's a lot of lanes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7491" target="_blank">02:04:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">open here. And I think the election will be once again, determined by moderates. And I think women</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7495" target="_blank">02:04:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who are still very much upset about the Roe v.

And I think those two things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7501" target="_blank">02:05:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going to play a significant role. And that's where I think Nikki Haley and Chris Christie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7504" target="_blank">02:05:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">believe it's a state's issue, and they're not into the national ban for abortion. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7510" target="_blank">02:05:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">moderates are not into Biden.

And I think Nikki Haley could happen. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7518" target="_blank">02:05:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">think Chris Christie, so I hope we get Nikki Haley on here, because I don't know her enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7522" target="_blank">02:05:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but I would like to have that to our discussion.
