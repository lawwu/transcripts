the New Testament and the Old Testament that if a child has bad attitudes or misbehaves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=126"

which I want to ward off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Both of them would result in a great diminishing of our joy of faith and a belittling of God's mercy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, it would be a mistake to go away from here and say, "The Bible teaches that one must be sinlessly perfect in order to have our prayers answered."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a big difference between an obedient child and a perfect child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know the Lord's Prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At the heart of the Lord's Prayer is this petition that Jesus taught us to pray,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I assume that since immediately prior to that petition was the petition, "Give us this day our daily bread,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that Jesus means for this prayer to be prayed each day, which means that he expects us to need to pray, "Forgive us our sins," each day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think Jesus had any illusion that his disciples would in this life outgrow the need to pray for forgiveness for sins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a great reassurance to me who sins daily in my own attitude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the inference that I draw from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Since he taught us to pray, "Forgive us our sins," it would be a contradiction to say that in order to have our prayers answered, we must be without sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's plain, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And therefore, it does not follow from Jesus' teachings that we must be perfect without sin in order to have our prayers answered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, the righteous person whose prayer avails much, as James says it does in chapter 5, is not the sinless person, but the repentant person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not the person who falls into sin, but the person who stays there and is content with his sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The person whose prayers are not answered is not the person who fights against temptation and now and then loses the battle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but the person who is quite content with his spiritual mediocrity and makes no effort to improve or to overcome his lethargy and carnality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, never say, "I must be perfect in order to have my prayers answered."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the first misunderstanding I want to avoid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The second misunderstanding that might arise from the fact that we must be obedient children in order to have our prayers answered would be that disobedience merits or deserves the answer to prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That one would follow very naturally, some might think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you've got to obey in order to get your prayer answered, then what he's teaching is that you've got to merit or deserve answers to prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that would go against everything I said at the beginning to the effect that the death of Jesus purchased for us the answers to our prayers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that we might receive them through mercy freely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the way I picture this, namely the importance of obedience in relationship to God's mercy, is something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">None of us is a child of God by nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the contrary, Paul says we are all children of wrath by nature,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which means that we have freely, by mercy, through grace, been adopted into the family of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have our standing as children not owing to anything meritorious in ourselves, but only owing to the grace of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, all good behavior in this family must spring from this dependence upon mercy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All true obedience to Christ, the only obedience that pleases him, is the obedience that springs out of our confidence in the power and the wisdom and the love of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only reason to disobey God is that we don't trust his advice, isn't it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gPFbPa7rNM&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only reason my sons disobey me
