I think it goes to the psychology of investing. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">were talking about annuities. Jonathan made the point that when you put your money with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">an annuity, the majority of the time, you're getting your money back for the first 15,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">20, 25 years. Looking at it that way, a lot of people emailed in and said, "I've never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thought about it that way." You could say, "That's a terrible deal. I don't get returns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">until after my whole money is paid back." But a lot of it is just psychology. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the whole thing about investing as it is. It's just so much depends on tricking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself into sticking with a plan.

It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it depends how much you need that psychological component to help you stay on course. It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have to be all or nothing, but I just wanted to touch on that because we had a lot of comments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">on that, surprisingly. Annuities, hot topic. Who knew? Anyway. Alright, Duncan, let's go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we got?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, first up, we have a short and sweet one, but a very interesting one. Can you help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">me understand where we are with total market cap over GDP, the Buffett Indicator, and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this could mean for the market going forward?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright, let's start with a definition here. Good question. In 2001, in an interview with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Carol Loomis, Warren Buffett laid out the Buffett Indicator. It was just comparing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">market cap of the U.S. stock market to U.S. GDP. He said at the time, I found this old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">piece, and he said, "The ratio of certain limitations and telling you what you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to know still is probably the single best measure of where valuations stand at any given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">moment." And as you can see, nearly two years ago, the ratio rose to an unprecedented level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That should have been a very strong warning signal. Now, that level was 150%. So, stocks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">were worth 150% more than GDP at the time. This is 1999, late '99, early 2000. The tech</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bubble had blown to epic proportions, and then it burst. And so, Buffett was looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">back at it after the fact, saying, "Look, if we would have just looked at this level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone should have known. Stocks were wildly overvalued." Now, John, let's do a chart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on it and see where we stand today. So, this is the Buffett Indicator today. You can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">today's value just dwarfed '99. '99 is 150%. We're now well over 200%, something like 220%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, on the Buffett Indicator. So, a lot of people think, "Well, wait. Buffett said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the single best indicator of stock valuations, and now it's way, way higher."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see, they drew like this, where I found this, they drew a historical trend line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here, showing that it's just way off-trend. So, what is this telling us? Basically, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stock market is around $50 trillion right now. $23 trillion GDP. Stocks are worth way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">more than the economy. I do want to preface this with the fact that Buffett was asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about this again in 2017, saying, "Hey, you said this in 2001. What do you think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it today?" Here's what he said, and I quote this. "Every number has some degree of meaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It means more sometimes than others. They can be important, meaning this valuation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they can be almost unimportant. It's just not quite as simple as having one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">or two formulas and then saying the market is undervalued or overvalued." I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a reason Buffett kind of changed his tune on this one, because things have changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is, you could be one of those people saying, "Every time I see a valuation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">higher than the past, I think bubble, bubble, bubble. Get out, get out, get out." Other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people say, "Well, context is more important than anything." And I'm a context guy. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you still have to wonder, why is this happening? So, John, put this other chart on. This one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is from J.P. Morgan, actually. And this shows the ratio of total U.S. financial assets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so this includes bonds and other assets, to GDP. And you can see, throughout the '50s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">'60s, and '70s, and even '80s, it was kind of just staying in this band two to three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">times. Now it's shot up to 5.6 times GDP. So even if you say, "Okay, maybe this doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">mean we're in an epic bubble like '99," what is going on here? How is this happening? I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">think there's some reasons, if people are worried about the Buffett indicator, to kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of put it into context. So the first one is easy. The stock market is not the economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's probably more true now than ever. I mean, just think about how powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">corporations are, especially now than they were in the past. Think about how important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">some of these companies were during the pandemic to keeping your life going, how big some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">these companies are. Apple, and Amazon, and Google, and Microsoft are basically their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">own economies these days. And they're not just based in the U.S. anymore, like they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">were back in the '50s and '60s. These are global companies. So we're dealing with global</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">earnings now. It's not just the U.S. John, let's do the next chart here. This shows the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">asset allocation by household to U.S. stocks. This is from an old post by the pseudonymous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse Livermore on philosophical economics. I come back to this often. This shows household</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">allocation to equities. Now, you can see here where I circled.
