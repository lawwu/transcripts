We all know that ChatGPT has a voice interface, right? Like you can talk to it now and you can interrupt it now, which is quite nice, right?</p><p>So you don't have to wait for it to finish this whole long sentence because like, well, wait a second, like tell me a little bit more about this. So you can tie that to your iPhone on that extra button that they have. And we ask it questions throughout the day, like tell me about this, tell me about that, right?</p><p>But one thing I realized that is really fun is if you just go outside, sit on your patio one day and think about a topic that you know very little about, but are curious about. So for me, that was quantum computing. And I was like, tell me about this, tell me about this.</p><p>And she, I have a voice trained, it's a female voice. This is what I tell her, but you're explaining this at a college level. Give it to me at a ninth grader level. She's like, okay, cool. At a ninth grader level, I'd explain it like this, right? And I got it.</p><p>After 45 minutes, I now have a really solid foundational understanding of quantum computing. And I didn't know any of that</p></div></div></body></html>
