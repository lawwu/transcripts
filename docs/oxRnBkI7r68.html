So close into the beam pipe, you have what are called usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=212">00:03:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">made of silicon, they're tracking detectors.

And then very edge, you have things called muon chambers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=235">00:03:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">which basically met these muon particles, which are the heavy version of the electron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=239">00:03:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They are, they're like high velocity bullets and they can get right to the edge of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=242">00:04:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">detectors. If you see something at the edge, that's a muon. So that's broadly how they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=246">00:04:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=247">00:04:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of that is being recorded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=248">00:04:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That's all being fed out to, you know, computers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=250">00:04:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That data must be awesome.

So we built a detector that sort of pyramid cone shaped basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=269">00:04:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that just looks in one direction.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=311">00:05:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">these are quite long lived things and they will actually fly a little distance before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRnBkI7r68&t=315">00:05:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">they decay.
