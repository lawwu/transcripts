So let's dive right in. We've heard a lot about how you know agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">are just software, however they are complex distributed systems, they need to cope with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with LLMs and they must scale and provide durability and reliability. Otherwise no one's going to trust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">your agent. You know we can build like really cool stuff but if it doesn't work nobody's using it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We also know that complex systems need orchestration. Decks use the word workflow a few times and essentially at the core of agentic AI applications is a complicated workflow that orchestrates multiple processes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">needs to handle state potentially over long periods of time, there needs to be human interaction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for approvals or other reasons and of course they need to be able to run in parallel for efficiency, call tools, there's just a lot of things going on. You know how many of you feel like building agents is really simple?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You're just calling one switch statement, right? Yeah? I mean there's a lot of things that are interacting here and how can you actually keep track of that, make sure it's running reliably as well as tracing and looking at the visibility of all of these pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And again you know these systems are inherently unreliable. How many of you have called an LLM and it succeeded 100% of the time? Yeah? Nobody's raising their hands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've dealt with this. As you're building these applications you are seeing inherently how unreliable some of the tool chain here is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you know difficult to debug and test and Alex has been talking about agent ops being kind of built around this but clearly the insight into what's happening has been incredibly hard to get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been incredibly difficult to test this in pre-production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the interesting thing here is that these problems have existed for some time in building complex distributed systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And Temporal is a company that was founded around solving these problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Our mission really is to outsource the reliability and scalability parts of building a complex distributed application seamlessly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, you can focus on the hard parts of writing your business logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The way that Temporal works is that we built language idiomatic SDKs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The languages are available there, and in fact, one of the fun facts here is that Python has overtaken all the other languages in the month of January, and that sort of is showing how much of Python is being used in building these applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We handle all the plumbing code for you, making sure that every process executes reliably, and providing you guardrails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a battle-tested product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Temporal has been in production for over a decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Temporal is used in mission-critical applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Temporal has been in production for over a decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So we feel that using Temporal for building your authentic AI applications gives you reliability out-of-box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I can stand here and talk all day about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably don't believe me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have some customer quotes here that will help you understand this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">One of them is from a customer called Dust that is building their agents on top of Temporal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other is a company you may have heard of that recently talked about the tech stack they use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And Temporal is very clearly featured there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We also have a number of use cases published.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So Gorgias, for instance, is using AI agents today in production built on Temporal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the company that does customer service for brands like Reebok or Timbuktu or Glossier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=331"

agility and speed because they can focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.740</a></span> | <span

using Temporal around building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic

what you can do is take Temporal and you can put applications out in production in weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=487"

And with reliable applications, customers are happier. Now I've talked a lot. I wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">walk through a example. I'm not doing a demo because of all the various issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it also seems like for some reason travel is like the the classic use case everybody seems to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">demoing. So let's dive right in. So we've got a demo of a ticket booking agent. This demo is live at our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">booth as well. So if you're interested, you can go look at that at the booth. And what we'll do is I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly walk you through a little bit of the architecture and how Temporal would work here. And so clearly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, some of the key pieces here are around the user, the system, which is Temporal and AI, your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">language models, goals and tools. And the way that Temporal works here is essentially going to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">take this flow and wrap pieces of this in Temporal concepts. So for instance, the workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">defines the flow of the application, and it's written as code. So this is where you would orchestrate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">interactive loops, you would receive, we have this notion of a signal, which is how the workflow gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">input. We have a notion of a query. So there's a rich set of abstractions that you program against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to build that workflow, that will essentially take kind of all of the pieces of this model that I'm showing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you and translate that into code. And nowhere in there will you have any statements or code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that we call plumbing code. That is, nowhere in there will there be statements like, if something fails,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, keep retrying it. All of those pieces are handled by Temporal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We also store all of the workflow history so that you can go in and you can look at the visibility of what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">happening as your agent is navigating this complex set of interactions. Temporal has the notion of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">activities. And so the tools that you use can be wrapped into activities. And again, this is just code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, with LLMs, you can use whatever provider you need, we are able to help you validate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the inputs and drive towards the goal. And again, failures are handled transparently by Temporal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then interactions are managed through Temporal signals and queries. And they're stored in the workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a very clear record of how your agent is executing. And you can go in and look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also export that. One of the things we are hearing is customers want access to that history for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">compliance reasons or for being able to go and debug in their test dev environment. So we allow the capability to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">export that entire history. And you can use it for whatever sort of purpose you might need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, here, you know, you can kind of look at the fact that we've got the ability to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">loops. We can, you know, it's a very rich programming model where you can take the various sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">use case patterns for your agent and you can build them as a workflow pretty quickly and get up and running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Temporal Cloud, of course, is where we do all of the heavy lifting around the reliability and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">scalability pieces for you. So your agent, your workflow, the code actually runs in your environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And Temporal Cloud is where all of the execution state, the call stack, the, you know, looking at all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">failures and retries, all of that is happening within Temporal Cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I know I'm speeding through a lot here, but definitely come by our booth as well. The worker is what I was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about. This is your code. It runs in your environment. It is essentially fitting into any of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">your own CICD practices. A big part of the Temporal focus has been on meeting developers where they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want you to change how you write code. We just want you to get more efficient and help you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">focus on writing your business logic and not having to worry about all of the reliability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and scalability issues here. And this, for instance, is the worker code for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">use case that I was just showing. I know this is a screenshot. What I wanted to show here is we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">this concept of a code exchange. Temporal, if you weren't aware, is an open source product as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can go in and I know this conference loves QR codes for some reason. So you can go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">in and you can actually look at the code at the code exchange and see how Temporal operates there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, Temporal Cloud is available.

You can go to code exchange. You can look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">any example you want. You can run that in your local dev environment. You can run it against cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can be up and running pretty quickly here. And we are, like I said, we are on the expo floor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izYWsokr9s&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So come by and chat with us.
