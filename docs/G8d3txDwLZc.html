Today, we will be talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=4" target="_blank">00:00:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">doc ETL, documentation, or rather document ETL. This is a paper by Shreya, big fan of her work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">very practical work. And of course, looks like there's another solid Eugene on this paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">so should be a great paper. So the entire, I'm going to try to go through it in a few,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of concepts to this paper, there's a lot of examples and a lot of results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to try to run through it very quickly and try to finish at 12.45 mark, and then we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">discuss what we learned and what we thought was useful. So essentially, the premise of the paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is that we can use LLMs to process documents for us in a fairly hands-off way. But the problem is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is that for fairly complex tasks and data, LLM outputs for what we wanted to do is fairly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">inaccurate. So a lot of times what we wanted to do, we just write a prompt, right? We just say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, LLM, given this archive, here are these 10 archive papers, find me everything that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant to hallucinations." We sort of do it in a very crude ad hoc way, every archive paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the snippet relevant to hallucinations, we pull it out, and after we try to combine it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we try to extract some teams from it, we may include citations, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this paper is trying to do is it's trying to provide formal vocabulary to try to do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and we'll see what the formal vocabulary is. So in a nutshell, they have an agent-based framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's put the agent-based framework aside for now, we won't focus on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So what they try to do is that they will define operators, and they will define directives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll define what operators and directives are, and then they will try to optimize this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the optimization is really called logical rewriting and agent-guided plan evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, optimization algorithm. I mean, I'm oversimplifying it, but all of this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially trying to optimize the overall pipeline to try to get what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they introduce directives and operators as well, which we'll get into right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of intro over here, and there's this very big diagram over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I won't actually go into this right now, I feel like we need some vocabulary before we can go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">into this. We need to understand what the pinks mean, what the greens mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and what the different maps, all these different bolded words mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm just going to jump right into it. I'm going to skip the programming model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Essentially what this is trying to do is it's trying to take database concepts and pandas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">dataframe concepts and try to apply them to shapeless documents. Is Shreya on the call yet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Not yet. Oh, Shreya is. Hey, Shreya, if I say anything wrong, just stop me and just jump in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just starting again to the operators right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So essentially, the operators are fairly straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have a note over here, it's really trying to think about how can we apply data pipeline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and database operations to LLM tasks. And the LLM task over here is really documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so at the very simplest level, we have the map operator. Essentially the map operator, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's this language here that's a little bit not so straightforward, applies an LLM powered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">projection known as a semantic projection to each documented data set. What this means,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and my interpretation of it is that given a document, we create new features out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can look at this example here. Given a document, what are all the instances of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">police misconduct and what's the name of the officer involved and a new description? Essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">given a PDF document, I want new columns for officer involved and new columns for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">brief description of the misconduct violation. So you can think of map. Map is infinitely flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Given a document, extract the relevant text. Given a document, extract your summarization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Given a document, translate it. Given a document, add a classification, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So map is the workhorse of the operators here. And then they also share about parallel maps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">where you can run maps in parallel. So you can see one prompt could be extracting misconduct,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">while another prompt could be summarizing policies. Essentially, you just do a map</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">on every single thing. Then after you do a map, you have to do a reduce. Essentially, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so let's say I've extracted all the different officer names, all the different incident dates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to return it as a report. Then we have to do a reduce. So map will spin up a lot of new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">columns. Reduce will take all those columns and try to generate something that's coherent and easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for a human to read. And then they also talk about batch folding. Essentially, they talk about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, sometimes a lot of this is bigger than your context length, and that's why we use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">map reduce paradigm, where you chunk it up and then you do reduce. But when they reduce, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's larger than the context length of the LLM, so they do folding. They talk about folding and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hierarchical aggregation, but they apply batch folding. Essentially, imagine here we have these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">six boxes, and then we need to aggregate them. Maybe we aggregate them two at a time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we do something like that. I think that's all very straightforward. It makes a lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there's the third operator, which is, in my opinion, a very important operator,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but a very difficult operator to get right, which is the resolve operator. In a nutshell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this is deduplication. You know, SWIX has the name of Sean Wang, has the name of SWIX,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">has the name of YX Wang. How do we know that they are all SWIX? This is extremely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">extremely difficult. So compare the following two officer records from the police documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And then how do we know that they're actually the same name?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, resolution has many different aspects of it. It could be sci-fi, science fiction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">sci-fi fantasy. Sci-fi fantasy is not really sci-fi, but depending on your context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you could consider sci-fi and sci-fi fantasy as the same thing. So there's a bit of domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">nuance to this as well. I think this is really, really difficult to do. I actually have a...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So one, several things I've seen in production is that when you do resolving and deduplication,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">if your deduplication is too loose, everything deduplicates to a single huge megacluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's when you get... That's when you have severity issues. And so this is actually very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">very tricky to get right. And in the paper, they actually talk about different ways to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And they actually talk about a cheap way to do this, which we have also implemented as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which is using semantic and code base, which we will talk about later. But long story short,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this is very difficult. And then they have other operators, very standard, filter. Essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">given a document, maybe we perform some kind of classification, do we want to filter the document,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or maybe you do some kind of map to extract the relevant sections and filter everything out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes sense. Equi-join is, again, I think it's really difficult. In a sense, it's sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like resolve, can you join these two concepts together? And then all of this all relies on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">schema. And then they have a few auxiliary operators. Essentially, auxiliary operators</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">means that it doesn't even rely on LLMs. A nest is one of them. So for example, given a document,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you have created a lot of... Maybe given a blog post, what are all the papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">referenced in this blog post? You'll return an array, a list. A nest basically splits that nest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">into individual elements. And then split is essentially, you can think of it as chunking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">In the most naive way, it could be chunking in terms of number of tokens. In a smarter way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it could be chunking based on paragraphs or chapters or sections, or it could be even LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">based splitting. And then gather is essentially gathering all the individual chunks. So for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">example, imagine you are summarizing an archive paper. Imagine you're summarizing section by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">section. The previous section was the operator section, and now we're in the rewrite section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it could be that when you're summarizing the rewrite section, you actually do need context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about the operator section. It mentions certain abbreviations that the LLM would never know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but you have to provide a kind of context. So what gather does is by providing this peripheral</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">information. So it could be as you're summarizing a document section by section, you collect some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of map on all the various abbreviations that they've shown up. So that you provide that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">context to the LLM, so the LLM doesn't try to hallucinate what those abbreviations mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are the basic parameters of doc ETL. I'll pause here. Any questions about the operators?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's essential to understand map reduce and resolve. Everything else builds on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a classic, not so much a question, more of a comment. My real question was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">was there a rank operator? And the answer is no. You could maybe compose the rank operator with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes split, gather, thingamajig, but it's not a formal ranking system. And even before AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I had always had this strong view that filtering, ranking, sorting, all this stuff is kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the same layer in the API stack, and should be kind of done together. This is my number one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">problem with AI news right now, which is that all filtering is effectively a rexis, and I have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">rank. Yes. So you filter just based on metadata, like hard numbers, because you don't have any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">other better stuff. If you could create a ranking formula, you would use the ranking formula rather</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">than any other filter basis. There is a filter op, right? So when section 2.2 in other ops,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the filter operation independently retains documents from the input dataset based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">conditions specified through an LLM prompt. In some sense, it's under ops, if you scroll down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a little. This filter one seems to, if you can specify conditions through an LLM and retain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">docs, that's a form of ranking, no? That's how I interpreted this one, as opposed to like, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, I think there's a question of sort of filter, then rank, or rank, then filter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in my strong view, filter. Yeah. You can think of filtering as in dropping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">items from an array, whereas ranking is me pushing things down or pushing things up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's slightly different. And you know, there's a question for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Shreya. Is there a reason why they're split into operators and auxiliary operators?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, very simply, we just wanted to put the primary LLM-powered operators in one section,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the one that people will probably spend a lot of time tinkering on, and the auxiliary ones</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are there to stitch them. So a lot of people want to do, for example, reduce after map,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">well, they want to unnest after map, and then do reduce there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.

We're working on a sort operator. We haven't found,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe Swix, we should chat about this. We haven't found a really compelling use case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">from any of the users yet.

I want to know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of, I think Swix's case is interesting. Like, in what cases does it make sense to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this pairwise comparison interface be the primary way to steer that operator? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe like ranking articles in terms of what is most interesting to a human could be such a case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's another case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry.

I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this is standard Rexis.

I feel like pairwise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe it's easy to do data entry.

And I also think that-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do you think it should be pairwise?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's just more reliable and stable that way. I think you don't have to go through all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if we do everything pairwise, it's quadratic, right? But we don't have to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">through all of that. We can sort of do it smartly. I think that, and you know, in Shreya's paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they actually cover how they use embeddings and codebase resolve, right? You can think of it as,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">also, you can apply that if you tweak that a bit, that can be applied to ranking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can also tweak it a bit. You can say that ranking, we actually have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">confidence levels. If the similarity score is strong enough or weak enough, like if it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">good, like 0.9, we know it's strongly related. If it's really bad, like 0.1, we know it's poorly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">related. But then there's a lot of stuff that's in the middle that then we can use an LLM power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">ranking. We can go into that a bit, but this paper is huge and I want to try to go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as much of it as I can. So now that we've covered operators,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they propose rewrites.

When you say rewrite,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">do you mean rewriting the pipeline or do you mean rewriting the document?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">What does rewrite in rewrite directive stand for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Rewrite, this is a good question.

When we say rewrite, we acknowledge that this operation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">might not work when you execute it. What if the document is too long? What if you're extracting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">too many fields? It's too hard. So you want to write it into more complex sequence of operators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So is my mental model right that the rewrite directives are somewhat in the realm of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">optimization already? Yes. Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So now we're going to talk about rewrite objectives. So let's again, take our example of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this archive PDF. We want to extract what the key teams are. A noob like me would just upload</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it to Cloud AI and Cloud AI, what are key teams? Now we can rewrite that to be smarter. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">rewrite it into a map, basically map the entire document into all text. And then we can do split,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we saw the split operator. And then on the splits, we can do a map on extracting the key teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can do a reduce, right? To try to reduce all these key teams. Again, the point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">here is that if we give the LLM smaller chunks, it is better able to pay attention and therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">come up with a more rich, more comprehensive and more factual summary. But you can imagine the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">search space of creating such a pipeline is infinite, right? The search space of chaining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">together all the different legal blocks of putting together all the different AWS services is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">infinite. So what they propose is a methodology to help us try to do that semi-automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I will focus on all the different things that they do in rewrites, but I'm going to call out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">what I think is absolutely essential. So rewrite directives. The first one is data decomposition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So essentially when you have very large documents and there are many documents, and then you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have to decompose it. The very standard pattern they share is document chunking, which everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">has been doing. This is standard. That said, I actually do want to share this example whereby</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I was asked to help with a pipeline, and I was able to improve downstream metrics significantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">by 20 to 50% by removing chunking. So every now and then it's good to rethink, hey, do we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">need chunking? In such cases, I think Shreya's example here is that it's way beyond the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">window size, and so you definitely do need it. So you can see they do chunking. So you can map,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">split, gather, map, reduce. And you can see the optimization. There's many, many different ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to optimize. I'm just going to pick B here. So you can imagine we could split it and then we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">gather all of it. After we split it, we gather all of it. But what they're proposing is that we split</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it, we create a summary, and then we create... I can't remember what H stands for. Hierarchical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">information. We create a summary and create hierarchical information. So we enrich the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">splitted chunks and then we gather it. So you can imagine essentially all pipelines now are LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">pipelines. LLM is enriching the data. LLM is cleaning the data. LLM is filtering the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be a bit lossy. It's going to be a bit stochastic, but I think we will figure it out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the next one to two years to get it to a more reliable state. So they actually share some very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">insider ghost knowledge. When splitting a document, there are some kinds of context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that are very useful. I fully agree with all of this. Document level metadata. What are all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">different abbreviations? Who's the author, et cetera? Hierarchical information. Summaries of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">neighboring chunks. Summaries of previous chunks are actually very valuable. So the LLM has enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">context and doesn't make shit up. And then they also have different patterns here, document level</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">metadata. Maybe I'll just go through one of them. So example, in this case, before you split it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you extract metadata that's relevant to all chunks. So by extracting this abbreviation metadata,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">author metadata, you make sure that all chunks, when you're doing map on all of these chunks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually have all this context. The LLM has all these contexts and is able to do a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reliable job. And then they have many, many different other patterns that you can consider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the next thing is multi-level aggregation. So you need to aggregate it. Essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">let's imagine you have hundreds of chunks. You are summarizing a movie and you have all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">different movie cut scenes. And imagine we don't have Gemini to do this for us and just upload the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">entire movie. Imagine you have to do it. We have to chunk it up. So what they propose here is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">aggregate, is to chunk it up, aggregating the data at a finer granular. So essentially, it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, we have seen one, or let's put it another way. Imagine you're trying to summarize a series</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of, oh, wow, this is a bit close. No, imagine you're trying to summarize the Harry Potter movies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could first summarize the first Harry Potter movie, first summarize every scene in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">first Harry Potter movie, roll it up to a summary of the first Harry Potter movie, and then roll it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">up to a summary of the entire Harry Potter movies. So that's hierarchical aggregation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they have several things here, like LLM centric improvements. There's this term here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">gleaning. So it's prompted with the previous inputs and outputs and asked to improve the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">inputs. I mean, to simplify, oh, sorry, Shreya has a hand raise. Oh, I didn't want to interrupt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you. Sorry. Your point about chunking, I thought was very interesting in that sometimes it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">beneficial to chunk and sometimes you should not chunk. And we have observed this in a number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">workloads. And the insight that we've gained is that we will never know when it's all task-specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and data-specific. And we are so further convinced that you kind of need some optimizer to explore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">these different choices for you and come up with something reasonable. But anyways, just a meta</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">comment on, it's not the rewrite rule that if you apply it, it always works. It's that if you apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it, it sometimes works. It sometimes works a lot better. And you need some way to kind of try a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of these things automatically for you. - I agree. Vips, you have a hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">- A little follow-up to that point. Somewhere, I think on like the first page where it talks about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">chunking and performance, there was just like a handful of dumps of citations of different papers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So like, there was a section, I think on the first page, recent work has shown that LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">performance degrades considerably as length increases. Citing a paper, they can be distracted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Citing a paper, pay attention more to certain papers, cite a paper, or fail to gain holistic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding. And there's like four citations. So pretty cool if anyone wants to dig into that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there's like eight citations on the first page that talk about this. And then another little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">comment actually. So you skipped over a few of the chunking strategies. So there's stuff like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">document level extraction header. I thought that the third one was kind of interesting where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have chunk filtering. I haven't seen this approach too often. So just if people haven't read it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's an interesting little one that popped up. So as you chunk, whether it's semantically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever it is, you can filter out sections. Not many other pre-processing handlers seem to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this, but the example here is pretty clear, right? So as you break up chunks, you can filter out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. So for example, in an archive research paper, you can filter out citations and references</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that aren't really relevant to the core information. It's just one of those chunking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">strategies that you don't see too often.

I think these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">practices that they have gained from working on very, very difficult real world problems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to just get the level of performance up. And you can take a lot of inspiration from this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Shreya, you have another hand raised. Oh, a small comment again for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">police misconduct data. Often we have like thousand page records documents where it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">just page on page of like random image of like a street sign or something.

So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where the filtering came from. Yep. Very valuable. Now they have LM centric improvements. This one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here is gleaning, which is prompted with the previous inputs and outputs and ask it to improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it. You can think of it another way if you have a valid. So that's one way you can imagine have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a validator in the loop or essentially like code. You just copy. Hey, Claude, here's my error</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">message. How do I fix it? This is very similar that given the previous input and output and error</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">message or some kind of feedback LLM, get it to improve on it. So this can, you can iteratively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">improve on this. And I think, uh, later we have an experiment result where they try to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">four times and you can see how it tapers off. But for some, in some instances, he just keeps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">improving, uh, as, as many times. So in this initial, so how this is, how this is done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, actually they do have any better within the loop. Okay. So how this is done. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You preprocess, you process it, you get the original map operation, like summary of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">paper, and then you have a validator, try to evaluate it and provide some feedback. Now you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">provide the previous summary and the feedback and maybe the context and then try to refine on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you just improve this many times. So you can imagine now all your SQL pipelines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all your data pipelines now have intelligence sprinkled in where it can, it can, it can map</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">where it can map on all this. We have a validator in the loop. So users can have a more capable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">model to be the validator. Yeah. Yeah. I think I missed the part about being a validator in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">loop. Because I thought it was just asked to improve the outputs. Yeah. But again, fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">agree. I think this cannot be done without an evaluator or validator. It's absolutely essential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they have this thing, duplicate key resolved. This is the problem, right? LLM outputs are not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">canonicalized. So for the same, for the same person six, they may have very many different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">names out there. So you have to canonicalize it. So they take semantic equivalent values of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">key. And I think they try to reduce the search space in the path. I can't remember where it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned, but they try, maybe they try to reduce the search space with embeddings and then try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">resolve this. Long and short of it, this is a very, very hard problem. And you have to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with fairly high precision. If not, you could be saying that Eugene Xia and Eugene Yan actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing. And Eugene Yan maybe just raised $10 million when it's really Eugene Xia. I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know how much Eugene Xia raised. I'm just making an example where precision is quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">important. Vips, you have a hand raised. Yeah. So when I read this section about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">gleaning, I saw the same thing. So I understood basically on the page you're at that there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">validation model. So there's a validator, but then it also says that that first paragraph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">they employ a separate validator and data generation. So go on below this next one. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't really see where this data generation LLM is, but I understand that you do some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-processing, you have a validator to check how it worked. Then you have a number of steps to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this, do your whatever processing, validate, process, validate. But I don't get where this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">data generation LLM is. And then it seems like data generation is just, that's the only reference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. So I didn't know if this is like, I just didn't see it too much in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it's ambiguous from us. I just meant the data processing LLM, the normal LLM that you use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So how does a traditional operation work? Look at figure four, you just have the output that comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from the data processing LLM, nothing more. What gleaning does is it adds that validation agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and it creates a loop of some finite number of iterations or whether the validation agent said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1571" target="_blank">00:26:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it was good. So you can just bound the number of times it refines, and then the final output,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that's all. So is it using that original step again? So it says it's a separate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">validator and data generation model. You can specify two different models. You could also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">specify the same model architecture, but the point is the validator agent has a different prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that has a specific instruction of, does this contain all the officers or instances?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the validator agent's job is to say yes or no with optional feedback. The data processor LLM's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">job is to give the answer. That's why we have a distinction between the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it. Got it. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And Shreya also has an interesting point that it's much easier to verify the output and generate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually observed the opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It depends on the task. For classification tasks, yes, it's easy for factuality or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">comprehensiveness or relevance, whatever. It's a lot harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the synthetic data gen papers like ORCA3, Wizard LLM, they show that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">models are better at verifying output than generating output. So you have a weaker...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So it's shown in other work too, but interesting note. It does depend on the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So next we have project synthesis. Well, this is tricky. I think what it means is that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">hyper-pipeline optimization. So essentially we don't really know what is going to be good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine that we have very many different ways on how to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can find that agents are... It's really hard for... If you have a pipeline generating agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's really hard for an agent to try to figure out which pipeline is going to work in the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">place. And there are infinite ways that you could build this pipeline. So they propose several ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this. And of course, the first thing is chaining. It's like iteratively chain LLM calls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to simplify the task. Essentially, this is what people say. Break up your task so that every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt only does a single thing. So it could be extracting entities, summarizing key points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and then generating recommendations. Another one could be isolating. So for example, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a question would be what sections of this paper talk about hallucination?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then so you could reduce the scope of work to be done on the doc, whereby you could just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">classify the documents, maybe just classify sections, classify paragraphs as related</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">documents, hallucination or not, and then just flag it up. So there's a lot there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I won't go through all of this. But anyway, that is the end of the rewrite section.

And projection means map in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">data world.

So any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">questions on rewriting directives? Okay. So now we're going to go into the optimization aspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So the key aspect here in the optimization aspect is that, okay, you sort of declare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">an initial pipeline. And then .etl will try to run that pipeline, get initial evaluation scores,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it will try to optimize that pipeline for you. So the two key agents here, that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">generation agent. So what a generation agent does is that the generation will actually generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">rewrites. So when we talk about generating here, the generation agent is going to generate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">rewrites and the alternative pipelines, the pipeline options. And then you have validation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">agents. And again, this is another example, right, of how evals and validation are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">fundamental to this. Because without the validation agent, you would not be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">assess and measure the different pipelines, how the different pipelines do, and then how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to compare between them. So there's two things. You generate pipelines. Second, you evaluate each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">step of the -- maybe you evaluate each step of the pipeline and you evaluate the overall pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we try to see which one performs well. So there's a lot of algorithms here. But I find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that the paragraphs here actually explain it. I found it far easier for me to understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So essentially, you can imagine that there's a pipeline, right? You have a pipeline. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">let's just stick to the police document, police example pipeline, all the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">examples of misconduct. So what you first do is you use a validation agent to create a custom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">validation prompt, right? And I don't know if we do need inputs and label outputs here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we actually need inputs and label outputs here to get the validation prompt?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Nope. I mean, you could -- we don't support that because nobody has ever come to us with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">labeled examples. The other thing that's hard is sometimes there are newly synthesized operators</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as part of rewrite rules. And those are certainly not going to have any label examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things we are exploring is we have an interface for doc ETL and we're exploring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of interactive optimization of pipelines. So if we synthesize a new operator, we might ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a human to label some examples and then use that for the validation prompt. But that's, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in the works. I think that's a good idea. And that's the entire crux of Align-Eval,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which I shared with you. I'm of a slightly different take. I feel like we do need some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">set of C human labeled data. So first thing, we use the validation data. We have a custom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">validation prompt. And then what a validation agent will do is sample some outputs from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">initial pipeline or from chunks of the initial pipeline to see if there's room for improvement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If there is room for improvement, what we do is we rewrite -- they have rewrite rules where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they apply to the subpipeline or the individual operation or the entire pipeline itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So then what that means is that -- and then they have this thing we should call recursive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">improvement. In the sense that when you create new optimizations for a rewrite,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you immediately optimize them before continuing the rest of the optimization. So what it means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that from a pipeline, imagine a pipeline goes from left to right, you start upstream,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">iterate on that, and then you go downstream. And this can take as much time. Compute is free. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">can just run it overnight. And of course, it just costs a few hundred dollars. But that's fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">compared to how much human time it would take. So now you have multiple candidate plans. Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just say you have 10 candidate plans. And then you take all these 10 candidate plans. You first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">execute each plan on a sample of the data. You don't want to execute it on all your thousands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of datasets. You just execute on maybe 50. And then use the validation agent to rate each output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So now after you've rated this sample, these different sample plans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">then you take the top K. And then you do, I think, full evaluation. Oh no, it does pairwise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">comparisons across these top plans. And the plan that wins most is the winner. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2096" target="_blank">00:34:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you select the optimized plan to do that. I think let's go through an example. I think an example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">here is helpful. So here is the police misconduct dataset. So the current pipeline is this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The team has a domain-specific clustering algorithm and then human annotation to de-duplicate officer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">names. And this is the baseline pipeline that the team has. So what they did was that doc ETL</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">synthesized various pipelines. The first one was to extract misconduct summaries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Extract the name and the summary of the misconduct before trying to de-duplicate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">on the officer name, before trying to resolve the officer name. And then it summarizes it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you can see here's a new... Was this synthesized by doc ETL, Shreya? Doc ETL-T?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Good question. So we are redoing this entire eval, by the way. So we're submitting this to VLDB</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">December 1st. You'll see an entirely new eval for the next version. But for this case study,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the doc ETL-S-T-O are all candidate plants from doc ETL's optimizer. And when we were exploring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">them, we were like, "Oh man, I don't even know which one is going to be better." Truly. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2191" target="_blank">00:36:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">read them, you have no idea.

Doc ETL-O was the one that was actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">selected. So you can see that they generated several plants. I don't know how many hundreds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of plants they generated.

So I think that's an example of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the optimization step runs. During a bunch of pipelines, validate it and optimize the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">subcomponents within the pipeline and the pipeline itself. So now that we've gone through this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we can now discuss figure one. We had to go through a lot of it, but I think now we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">discuss figure one. Figure one is you can imagine all of these are police documents and we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">extract the names of officers and the misconduct. So you can see this is the user-defined map,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Okay. And maybe if I'm a user, my initial prompt is very basic. Given a PDF,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just extract any cases of misconduct. So now we apply the rewrite directives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We apply rewrite and the rewrite, of course, we have the baseline, which is no change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We can do projection synthesis, which by we extract name, extract summary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then after that do another one. Or we could do decomposition where we split the document up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">together and map. And then all of these, all the pink boxes are where the agent will automatically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2321" target="_blank">00:38:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">rewrite it. And then the green boxes are when the plan is selected and NC here stands for NSYNC. No,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it stands for no change. Essentially, if it's no change, we just accept it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2332" target="_blank">00:38:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see, we just go through from left to right. And that is just for extracting any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2338" target="_blank">00:38:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cases of misconduct. After you've extracted these cases of misconduct, you can see Officer A,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Sergeant B, and Officer C, then now we need to reduce it. And again, we apply the same thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">down the stream. So we start from left to right. Every time we generate something new,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we validate it. And if it passes, if it's good enough, we move on to the next one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it just iteratively goes down the entire stream. So now that is the section on operators,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">rewrite directives, and optimization. And that's all summarized in this document. Any questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I can answer RJ's question.

I get how you can generate good evaluation prompts for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">individual operators, but why do we trust an end-to-end auto-generated trust? Oh, sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">end-to-end auto-generated judge. I too was very skeptical, but then I saw the kinds of tasks that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2397" target="_blank">00:39:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the journalism team here at UC Berkeley was running, which was extract all cases of misconduct,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">where they have defined misconduct in the prompt. Very precision, recall-oriented tasks here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which you can have an LLM judge pretty ambiguously determine whether one output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is better than another.

LLM is just super good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So I think what really sold me was having an optimizer like this that off the bat improved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">performance for the actual people who are working on these tasks, who are going to be authors in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the eventual submission, just because they've contributed a lot to helping out with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2439" target="_blank">00:40:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation here, kind of guiding what they find useful. But once you kind of see it work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of hard to go back. I know Eugene Yan also has experience with LLM as judge here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I strongly believe it could work. I mean, last year, this time last year, or maybe a few months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2459" target="_blank">00:40:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like in June last year, I didn't think it could work, but I've been debating it a lot. I've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">trying a lot. I think when we simplify it to binary classification metrics, I think it can work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think a lot of things can be simplified to binary, like Shreya mentioned precision,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of things can be simplified to binary classification metrics.

Well, you may have to apply chain of thought, you may have to include</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a few few short, you may have to do a bit of self-consistency or ensembling.

Eugene Chia, you have a hand raised. Yeah, I think the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">important aspect to consider in this scenario is that what is the failure condition? So in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">case, right, if let's say this pipeline fails, right, it still reaches the journalist and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2496" target="_blank">00:41:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">becomes a human in the loop kind of situation. Like the failed documents can be ignored safely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">because they achieve their goal with the successful documents. In the case of using this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">pipeline in a more Q&A, agent style for helpdesk, right, a failed answer impact is a lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">drastic.

The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">optimizer's goal is to rewrite the user's pipeline into something that is more accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this process, the optimizer explores a lot of plans using LLMs to create those plans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to verify, to evaluate those plans. So that's where the cost goes up. The reason it was $100,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">if I ran the optimizer with GPT 4.0 mini as the LLMs, it would be $10. But we use GPT 4.0 just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">because I think we did this at a time where mini hadn't come out yet. Anyways, but LLMs are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">trending to be cheaper and cheaper. This project is a very high budget project, but I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in the future as LLMs are much cheaper, as open source LLMs get much better, the cost should not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">be an issue for such kind of approach. And then your first question was, what is the high-level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what's the vision for the project? - No, I mean, just what's the input/output?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I, from the title, when I first started reading it and went through all this section one, two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">three, I was like, I thought it was more so single document to better extraction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2812" target="_blank">00:46:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like pre-processing a document for a RAG system. And then once I get to the end, so my whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">background was, let's say I've got 10,000 documents that I want referenced in a RAG system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I doing this on all of them? And then it turned into, you can throw this at a data set of a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of hundred docs. So like, there was a bit of a jump there. - Yeah. So it's, this is very different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">from traditional RAG or Q and A or document processing for a chatbot. Like the kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">queries that people are, people want to use doc ETL for can be expressed as ETL, SCDIL,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sweep and harvest kind of, I want to look at my entire data set. I would hire an analyst to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">at my entire data set and then just tell me things, generate me reports that I can then learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">from. So for example, this officer in misconduct thing is much more digestible than say looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all these millions of PDFs. So in that sense, I mean, you can certainly apply chunking or like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe a strategy used for processing one of the documents could be used for RAG systems, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">focus is not RAG. It's like building a kind of semantic layer on top of your unstructured data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is the way that I like to think about it. - Got it. Got it. Thank you. - Okay, cool. And I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't have time to go through the examples at the end, but definitely do go through the examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at the end. And you can see, okay, let's just, for the police example one, you can see they had three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">binary criteria. Did this binary criteria come from the team that was doing the work? - Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">- Okay. Like whether each officer name referred to a real person, if the summary included dates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">whether each identified misconduct was- - This is a very weak evaluation. So part of the reason we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">want to rerun this evaluation is just this task here doesn't have any grounds roots. So when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">ask the people, like, what do they care about? It's they look at some of the outputs, they look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">at their data you'd need, and they're like, oh, the officer names are fake. So that becomes a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">criteria for them. 'Cause sometimes it'll be officer A, officer B, officer C, that's not real,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not what they want extracted. They'll read some of the summaries and say, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2943" target="_blank">00:49:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">some of them aren't exhaustive. I want them to include date, location, names, summary of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2949" target="_blank">00:49:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. So I think like the criteria emerges from looking at the data and it's not necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a reflection of like how well the LLM did this task. - Gosh, I think Shreya must have seen this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">red post-it note and preempted me. - But that's the question, right? From an academic standpoint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this is an underwhelming evaluation because there's no ground truths, right? So we're redoing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">our evaluation to be on datasets where we actually have ground truths from human annotators, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that's just not a practical setting. Like nobody's coming to Doc ETL with the ground truth. - That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">why we do a line eval to get them to provide ground truth and give me five. And you can imagine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right, let's just say police misconduct. You can imagine there's two officers, Eugene Cheah and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Eugene Yen, and then we resolve them to Eugene. And then now it becomes, the risk is higher,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Eugene Cheah or Eugene Yen conducted some offense. So that's the problem where resolution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is very tricky. I think somewhere you mentioned resolution, you have a metric of recall. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">actually think it's precision is actually more, it depends on your use case. I actually think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">precision is actually something that we want to be careful about. - Yeah, we do measure precision in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the updated eval that is not on archive. - So yeah, they also have two other examples here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3038" target="_blank">00:50:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, very valuable. This is really people doing the work, sharing the work they did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what were the pain points and how they improve on it. Just definitely do read this end-to-end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll definitely learn a lot. And you can see this is the number of, again, this is the number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of iterations. You can see it just keeps getting better even on the fourth iteration or the third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">iteration, though it may be expensive, whereas on some things like distinct games, maybe after one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or two iterations is good enough. Again, it depends on your cost and how much latency you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">incur. So yeah, I think that's all key takeaways. We can think about the operations we do as a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">key operators, map, reduce, resolve, filter, rank, maybe. We can think about how we want to rewrite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">these operators together in a different way.

About a year ago, a year and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3145" target="_blank">00:52:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a half ago, I was like, "Validation.

And Sean, as you may know, works on small AI as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">well, which does summarization and search on this kind of thing. So lots of high level method. Hence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3232" target="_blank">00:53:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see why they were the most active in their conversations as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I've dropped a few links about this. I think that you should definitely read Shreya's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">previous paper. This paper is really, really, really good. And what I really like about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it actually has UX research. You actually have participants who... So you can hear what other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people are saying. That's very useful. I'll also drop another link to a compilation I did on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">different LMSHR techniques. So I think that's... It's helpful. It's a lot, I realize,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but it actually references a lot of other papers. So this can be helpful for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

Yeah, we'll do. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Eric. Thanks. Thank you, Shreya,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for joining us.

I would say you'll just leave. He made me the host. He made you host. Can you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">stop the recording? Yeah, but then the thing is my session kind of bugged out and I need a refresh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the host will stand out eventually. This session is not the host. Oh, shoot. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3323" target="_blank">00:55:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to have to leave then. I have a NAH meeting. All right. See you, man. Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I might... I have a backup recording, I think. So if we lost it, then I can provide that. We'll see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8d3txDwLZc&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep, yep, yep. No worries.
