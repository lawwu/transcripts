And so what seems to be happening is that hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of little groups are communicating hardly at all with each other, are in very small sizes.</p><p>In every group of human beings of hundreds of people, they accumulate shared cultural knowledge, knowledge about tools, knowledge about life strategies, and they build up a shared knowledge more and more and more and more. But if you have a limited sized group of people that's not interacting with other large group of people, occasionally this group has an information loss, there's a natural disaster, key elders in the group die, and knowledge gets lost, and there's not a critical mass of shared knowledge.</p><p>But once it goes above some kind of critical mass, the group can get larger, the amount of shared knowledge becomes greater, and then you have a runaway process. The adaptations that humans have are ones that allow us to access a rich amount of shared knowledge and not just to rely on figuring</p></div></div></body></html>
