probably he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">must have been maybe 15 or

target="_blank">01:22:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">class i mean i already studied like calculus on my own stuff like that but then i actually took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=4960" target="_blank">01:22:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a proper college so what do you say on your own that would be largely con academy um

time for learning and khan academy did you find that that stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=5387" target="_blank">01:29:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you did on like khan academy or whatever like was was useful in preparing you to take stuff like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=5405" target="_blank">01:30:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like geometry i think i'll explain some algebra and geometry i mean i i learned the concepts so i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=5411" target="_blank">01:30:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">don't how long so i did the job definitely definitely did his job and so i also learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

was a time in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=5422" target="_blank">01:30:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm used to like i think a nice thing about like these like khan academy and these sorts of lectures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=5426" target="_blank">01:30:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and stuff it's like it's very easy to to like devour a lot in a lot of a lot of content right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

for learning was not so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=5455" target="_blank">01:30:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">accessible i

wanted to be doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=5998" target="_blank">01:39:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">cutting-edge

i guess path</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6017" target="_blank">01:40:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">i've taken is still kind

target="_blank">01:40:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a four-year university and then a phd which i was gonna say i mean you're not like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:40:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like a sort of conventional path that i've taken i think i mean that was the only thing i tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6052" target="_blank">01:40:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">people like i think it also depends on the field like obviously i think there's some fields where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6056" target="_blank">01:40:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe a conventional path is necessarily the best path so um but i think you know for the field that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6062" target="_blank">01:41:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">at least is sort of like um i guess i'm into this sort of biomedical engineering field</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6067" target="_blank">01:41:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">unfortunately it's kind of hard to to do much work in that field if you don't have this sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6073" target="_blank">01:41:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of conventional uh background and so for us that is also about like you know you know just working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6080" target="_blank">01:41:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with the system and trying to um you know try to i guess i one person was saying like i'm like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6088" target="_blank">01:41:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">hacking the system like trying to accelerate in the system so sometimes there's that aspect of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6093" target="_blank">01:41:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but yeah like i guess i think also the nice thing about a conventional system is you do have those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6100" target="_blank">01:41:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">goals and like again i work very well with having these goals so it's like you know you have those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6105" target="_blank">01:41:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">goals and it's very easy to to you know have that motivation to to meet those goals and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6111" target="_blank">01:41:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is not that's another nice aspect of you know the conventional system but you know again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6116" target="_blank">01:41:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it depends per person like i i i do realize there are some people where that sort of system just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6121" target="_blank">01:42:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't work um yeah what is it about biomedical engineering that makes like a more conventional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6130" target="_blank">01:42:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">path necessary i think there's again this sort of um so like yeah again it's this sort of thing where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6139" target="_blank">01:42:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know if you want the best career opportunities i think you have to have at least a bachelor's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6145" target="_blank">01:42:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">degree and a lot of the times you do need a phd and those are the sorts of backgrounds that of course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6151" target="_blank">01:42:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">um you a lot of companies will require or if you want to get into academia of course that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6158" target="_blank">01:42:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">standard path but then also uh but it's hard i guess depends on what your what kind of research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6164" target="_blank">01:42:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you're interested in but oftentimes the research is done in academic labs or in in various companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6171" target="_blank">01:42:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so uh you know you have to be involved in that system to be able to get the hands-on experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6178" target="_blank">01:42:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so that that is a major challenge i think if you are maybe working in like biology and more of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6182" target="_blank">01:43:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know life sciences and things like that you do have to somewhat work within that system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6189" target="_blank">01:43:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whereas something like computer science and deep learning and things like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6192" target="_blank">01:43:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's definitely much easier to work outside of that system and you know you can change a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6198" target="_blank">01:43:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">unconventional path so yeah i mean there's plenty of um there's plenty of literal high school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6203" target="_blank">01:43:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">dropouts who have gone on

target="_blank">01:43:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so that is the that is a challenge if you're in the more yeah more in the biomedical field but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6216" target="_blank">01:43:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah sometimes you just have to uh work with that system and um i mean yeah i definitely i think um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6224" target="_blank">01:43:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and i think i think like also it just depends on yeah if you still think it depends per person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6232" target="_blank">01:43:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">right like i still feel like i did get a lot out of the commercial system which i i guess maybe for</span></div><div class="c"><span

like i learned a lot going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6246" target="_blank">01:44:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">through the

target="_blank">01:44:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">experience with research and you know learning how to do good research i mean we'll come back to this</span></div><div class="c"><span

that's true yeah um he also had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=6263" target="_blank">01:44:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">an

target="_blank">01:44:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's there's a balance of like you know what opportunities are or what paths are more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">02:57:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">particular situation um again that's the same point in terms of like getting fellowships and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

like i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=11106" target="_blank">03:05:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">think i may have seen like

target="_blank">03:20:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">background in pathology um so he he did his md um a while back like i think in the 70s so this is</span></div><div class="c"><span

it like you mentioned like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNIPiNrl9Jo&t=12843" target="_blank">03:34:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this was
