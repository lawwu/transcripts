When it released this last year, to our surprise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it got a lot of attention and also it inspired many other offerings that we saw that were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">out there as well, too. My favorites, of course, were the ones that Neo4j did with the card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">game, because I'm a huge board game fanatic as well, too. But there's been lots of derivative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">work from it. And today, though, I'm not here to talk to you about some of the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. I'm here to talk to you about some of the new horizons. And the two things I really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">want to leave you with here today are that LM memory with structure is just an absolutely key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">enabler for building effective AI applications. The second, as we'll talk about a little bit later in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the talk as well, too, are that agents, of course, paired with these structures can provide something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">even more powerful. And let me go ahead and go back to the slide here. So today, I'm going to tell you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">about a couple things. The first is actually showing you Graphrag as applied to a specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">domain. In this case, we're going to apply it to the coding domain to look at enterprise productivity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in the coding space. The second is we're going to take a look at a new release that we are announcing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">today. We're actually having a blog post on this tomorrow. We have benchmark QED just went open source</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. And then I'll talk about some new results that we've had on some Graphrag evolutions on a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">technology we've been working on called lazy Graphrag. I won't be going into the specifics of how many it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">works. I'll just be showing some benchmarks and talking about some of the ways you'll be able to access it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">soon. So with that, let me go ahead and jump into Graphrag for code and tell you about how we've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">using Graphrag to actually help drive repository-level understanding. And I want to start first with a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">demonstration. Everyone likes to watch little videos, so I'm going to go ahead and hit play. And yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it's showing on the screen there. So this is a little terminal-based video game that one of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">engineers have put together. It's one where you jump over obstacles, and then you get points when you jump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">over them, and you run into them, you lose points. And two important things, though. First, the LLM has never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">seen this code before, and it's small enough for the human to know the ground truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">holistically because it's only about 200 lines of code across seven files. But it's complex enough that the LLM's had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of troubles understanding it if you just provide all the code directly into the context window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that as a background, let's take a look at what happens if you use typical regular rag over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the top of this. So if you're using one of the tools that help analyze your code, this is the type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">answer you might get back. And this is -- we ran this through with a regular rag system. And we asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it, describe what this application is and how it works. And just to read you what it says, because it's too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">small to read, "The application is designed as a game that is configured and initiated through a main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">function. The game leverages a configuration file and has its main components, such as the game screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">game logic, encapsulated in separate classes and functions." Totally useless. It just says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a game. There's nothing more to it than that. And it just put a bunch of other cruft in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">If you use GraphRack for code over the exact same code base with the exact same question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you get a much, much better description. This is just a very stark contrast you get between the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the GraphRack for code, it says, "The application is a terminal-based interactive game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">designed to run in a curses-based terminal environment. So far, not much better. But this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">next line just kills it." It features a player character that can jump vertically, obstacles that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">move horizontally across the screen, and a static background layer. The game controls via keyboard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">inputs, specifically using the space bar to trigger the player's jump action. So what this is showing you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is semantic understanding. So if you've read our paper or used any of the GraphRack code base that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we've put out there, you'll know about the concept for what we call local and global queries. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what we would call a global query over top of the repository. It requires understanding the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">repository to answer that question correctly. And we can see that it excels at that. So one of the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">things we decided to do was, well, if I can answer questions pretty well, can it maybe do code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">translation? And so that was the next thing that we aimed it at. So taking the same code base here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we took on the challenge of taking this Python code and then asking to translate it directly into Rust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me show you just how that actually works. I'm going to play the video here. So we're going to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to start off with in VS Code here. We're going to look at the four source code files. Well, there's four main ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There's seven files total for this game. These are the source Python code files that we're working with here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to go ahead and run those just to show you again. This is the same game. So this is again the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">side scroller game here. And then what we're going to do is we're going to actually take those source code files and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">put them straight into an LL. We're first not going to use GraphRack for code. We're just going to take all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">source code, because it's only 200 lines of code, and put in some nice prompts. We tried a wide variety of these prompts and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">then try and see if the LL could actually translate that code holistically in all of its pieces into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Rust and actually just work out of the box. And so this is actually the translation happening there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to go ahead and copy the Rust code that it generated. So it did generate Rust code. I have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">give it credit for that. But after it generated the code and we reviewed it there, we went and we tried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to compile it and there's problems everywhere. It doesn't work out of the box. So then we use GraphRack for code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">again bringing structure and these graph structures to the code base there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to just go ahead and run the translate function there on GraphRack for code. And it generates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">on its side all these new Rust files that you see are on the side there. I'm just going to skip past</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">here because I don't want to bore you with clicking through a bunch of Rust files. But once we generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all these Rust files, we can go ahead and run those Rust files on GraphRack for code side of things and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">presto, we have a full video game completely translated from Python now working in Rust natively. But we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't want to stop there. The next thing that we wanted to do was, well, that game is kind of a toy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">example. It's like 200 lines of code. Let's go to a code base with 100,000 lines of code. And that's what we did next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we went to the Doom code base. It's about 30 years old. Now, we did run a bunch of tests over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the top of this here first because I figured, well, all the LLMs are trained on the Doom code base. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to just know these things natively and automatically. So we did a bunch of tests with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that. We actually figured out, well, it knew the Doom code base. It didn't know any of the specifics. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you ask it to actually modify the Doom code base in any sort of meaningful way, the LLM models just fail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">again completely. So then what we did next was, well, if we can reason and understand over top of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">code base, 100,000 lines of code, 231 files, maybe we can generate some new outputs that you otherwise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't generate. So with that, we then immediately had to start -- used it to start generating documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is actually showing a high level repository level documentation. Again, going back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">concepts of GraphRag, we have local and we have global queries. This is showing you the global query</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">results. And so it's not looking at the understanding of a single file. This is looking at modules in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">entirety, like across 20, 30 files and being able to actually give you sense for, like, what's the sound</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">system inside of the video game and how does that work? But then you can still drill down into what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">would call the local style queries and actually see the individual files as well, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So then we thought, well, this is kind of neat. We can look at the documentation. But if we look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">at the documentation, we can do Q&A and we can do code translation. Can we maybe take this one step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">further? Do feature development. So that's the next thing I'm going to show you. So we had a lot of video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">game players in our office and we were kind of thinking about, like, what would be a cool thing we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">put over top of this Doom video game? And somebody said, well, you can't jump in the original video game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What if we added the ability for a player to jump? And that's a complex thing to add into Doom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because it requires multi-file modification. And if you tried to use AI systems to do multi-file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">modification, what it'll often do is it will do a great job editing one of the files and then completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">break a bunch of the other files in the process of doing so. And then that just rinses and repeats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and continually kind of -- you end up with something that doesn't work is what you oftentimes run into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's because of this lack of understanding how everything fits together. But again, this is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">GraphRag can really help out. So with that, we went ahead and this is -- if you haven't seen the Doom video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">game, this is actually a little video of the original Doom video game being played just to give you some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">context for what it was. Then we used the new GitHub Copilot coding agent that was announced at build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And we wired it up directly to a GraphRag for code. So we're going to go ahead and create a new issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is pointing to the Doom code base. And we're going to tell it add jump capability to the player.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We're just going to add a couple sentences of description here and then tell it to go. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">then we're going to assign it to that GitHub Copilot coding agent. And then the next thing we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is we're going to then go ahead and look at what's happening underneath the hood. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actually the GitHub Copilot coding agent reaching out to GraphRag for code on the back end, coming up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with a plan that's holistic and it's approaching it from the top down. And then this is really the moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the aha moment we had for us. It changed a whole lot of files and it worked out of the box where all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the other agents that we had tried completely failed on this task. And because it worked because of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">GraphRag structures that we were bringing to bear and actually using those with that. So then the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">result was we were related with joy and jumping in Doom specifically. So that's kind of the story of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we got to with that. So with that, I do have another part of the talk I'm going to talk about today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's also five minutes to talk about that one. And that's benchmark QED. Just shifting topics a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit. I just showed you GraphRag is applied to one vertical. Next, I want to specifically talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about how do we measure and evaluate systems like GraphRag? How do we build systems to evaluate those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">local and global quality metrics? And so for that, today I'm announcing benchmark QED. This is available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">now open source on GitHub. So you can go ahead and check it out at the link. We just, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">got it live last night. And there's three components to this. The first is what we're calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Auto-Q. And Auto-Q is focused on doing query generation for target data sets. So it allows you to take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">data set and then generate queries for it. Auto-E is the evaluation using LLM as a judge to actually then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluate how those queries performed on that said data set. Auto-D is the third component. And that really focuses on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">data set summarization and data set sampling. Let's jump into just a couple of these in a little more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">detail. So if you take a look at Auto-Q, Auto-Q is taking a look at the local and global aspects. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can see that there on the x-axis. On the y-axis, it's then combining that against data-driven, basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">questions that are generated based on the data itself, or persona or activity-driven, which is the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">type that we have there. Those are more complex. So like, if you take on the role of a person in that domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">field, and then using that to generate questions. So to show you a few of these sample questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to choose a couple here. This was built on an AP news data set that was focused on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like medical type of events. And so a data local question might be, why are junior doctors in South</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Korea striking in February 2024? There's a lot of highly specific information in this, and I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">expect regular AG to perform very well on this type of question. In contrast, take an activity global</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">question here. It might be, what are the main public health initiatives mentioned that target underserved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">communities? There is nothing in that question that you can really pivot on in terms of like embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or indexing that would really work on that. You really have to holistically know the entire data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">set. And so this Auto-Q will help generate questions across that whole spectrum, from local to global,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from data-driven to activity-driven, and give you these categories of questions that you can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, once you generate those questions, we can then start measuring them using Auto-E,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the evaluation platform that we released along with this as well too. So just to show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">how this in practice and how it works, it gives you a composite score for metrics. The first is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment, which if you're familiar with our paper, those are the three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">original ones that we used back in that one, and a new one that we also call relevance. And so we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">did some comparisons just to show you how this works on lazy graph rag, which is one of the newer technologies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've been working on. And we compared it to vector rag on 8K, 120K, and million token context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">windows. And we had a few takeaways from that. The first is if you take a look at these charts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">any bar that is above the 50% mark means that lazy graph rag is winning in that benchmark against those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">specific vector rags. So vector rag blue here is 8K, 120K, and a million token context windows. And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">winning correspondingly at 92%, 90%, and 91% of the time against data local questions, which is kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of a surprise. Because one of the first things that we started seeing is that lazy graph rag was actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">providing dominant performance across the entire span of questions, whether they were local or global.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And we do expect rag to be performing better on local questions. And you can see that from the fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">data local and the data global, there's a little bit of a lift between these bars between the global and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">local ones. Second thing we noticed is that the long context window didn't really make much of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">difference. We were expecting that maybe the long context windows might give you a little bit of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because, again, a better understanding towards those global types of questions. But it actually turns out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that lazy graph rag in this case was still able to dominate those metrics. And in fact, when we ran the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">test, it's not on the slide here, we actually found that lazy graph rag was a tenth of the cost of what we saw in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the one million token context windows as well, too. So those are a couple things to show there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, with the last minute that I have, I did want to address another thing, too, with lazy graph rag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You may have read the blog posts about it in November last year when we first discussed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It is now officially being lined up for launch in a couple products. The first is Azure Local. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they just announced at Build that lazy graph rag will soon be incorporated into their platform for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So you can actually try it out for yourselves there. And it's also being incorporated into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">recently announced app build Microsoft discovery platform tool as well. So if you're not familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with Microsoft discovery, it does graph-based scientific co-reasoning. And just to give you a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">quick summary of it, it goes from hypothesis to experiment, learning, knowledge. I'll just play a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">quick, like, five-second video here. And the questions -- the answers to the questions that you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">coming back to with on this are powered underneath the hood by graph rag and lazy graph rag as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">too. So as you can see, the co-pilot here is generating the deep reasoning over graph-based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">scientific knowledge. Those graphs are being powered by graph rag and lazy graph rag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that, I just want to leave you with a couple takeaways. And the first is just that LLM memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">structure -- LLM memory with structure is just a really, really powerful tool to keep in your tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">belt. And the agents, of course, can massively amplify this power. And if you have any questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qJHr3DnT4&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll be outside if you want to talk about any of this further. Thank you so much for your time.</span></div></div></body></html>
