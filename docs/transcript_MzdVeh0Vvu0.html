There's nobody I think has a great. It's inconceivable, everyone's a human. It's inevitable. And by the way, even when someone does have a great, and people have had, I've had 'em, people have had 'em eight year, nine year, six year, 12 year, 20 year runs.</p><p>Life is too challenging. I know friends who I know intimately and know well enough to say the following, great 10, seven, 12 years, and then boom, child sick. Great 10, 12 years, and boom, father was the rock of the family, gone, heart attack. So, you know, this concept that somebody's got a great life is like just incredibly judgmental and lacks like the nuances I think are required.</p><p>And I think we are at a hyperbole of this judgment world now.</p></div></div></body></html>
