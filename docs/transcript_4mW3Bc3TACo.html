Having all the context in your mind of what's going on, of what you're working on, what the company's doing, makes it way easier to operate effectively. And if you could, for instance, have two half-time employees or one full-time employee, you're way better off with one full-time employee because they're going to have way more context than either of the part-time employees would have and thus be able to work way more efficiently.</p><p>And so in general, I think our experience has actually been that concentrated work is pretty valuable and that if you keep breaking up your work, in general, if you do that, you're never going to be able to do as great of work as if you really dove into something.</p><p>(upbeat music) (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
