what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that means concretely we build these products that we call droids they are autonomous systems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that are applied to different stages of the software development life cycle think code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the droids has like separate cognitive architectures which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are mapped to the tasks at hand and in particular the you know droids like review droid or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

something like the code droid which is able to take nearly any natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=73"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so the idea for this talk is let's just start describing what we think of as an agentic system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this like agentic systems have a lot of different interpretations a lot of different definitions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we think that there's three characteristics which are kind of most representative of an agentic system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the first is planning i think you've probably seen a lot of this in this track the idea that the agentic system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">can make decisions about one or future or many future actions that it's going to take decision making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">some people call this reasoning i think that a lot of these systems just the ability to make a decision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">have some criteria and some algorithm that's associated with making that decision is kind of critical in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">order for agentic systems to take on more general or broad tasks where the decision space is very wide and then you have environmental grounding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and so you know a lot of systems have planning they have decision making but i think the existence of an agent within an external</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">environment is very critical to understanding some of the unique properties of agentic systems when you're actually implementing them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">so being able to read and write to these environments is a you know a critical part of this process and so let's talk about planning first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">uh so the first idea that we kind of encountered is inspired by control systems and robotics the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of the pseudo common filter is as you are working through a plan what happens is you tend to notice that your agentic systems will lead will be led astray</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">their reasoning will change rapidly and as you kind of iterate through especially long plans you can imagine that in order to migrate even a small section of a code base you might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">uh so that you have literally hundreds of steps in a process and so inspired by a lot of the folks that on our team come from backgrounds in self-driving and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">robotics uh the pseudo common filter is basically passing intermediate reasoning and you can get pretty complex about how you modify or share the intermediate reasoning through the different plan steps but as you pass that intermediate reasoning through the execution of the plan steps uh it allows the like individual decisions that happen on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">uh the plan to slowly converge towards at least consistent reasoning uh the kind of core issue with this is it also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">facilitates error propagation a simple mistake especially early on in the plan can lead to like you know strong downstream effects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">subtask decomposition this is pretty well known even reacts about like some of the earlier agentic uh action systems uh have some form of subtask decomposition uh but you know what we found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">what we found is that experimenting with different forms or structures of subtask decomposition in our planning process uh has led to a lot of like pretty interesting downstream</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">downstream positive effects uh in particular it when you basically increase the resolution or the fidelity of your subtasks in a given plan it gives you more fine grained control it allows you to define kind of the action space a lot more clearly however the risk is you're introducing a lot of decisions for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">um for the lm to make the more like small tiny tasks you introduce the harder it is for the system or the agentic system to decide what's right um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">um then you have model predictive control this is again you know not a new idea not invented by anyone here but the idea of evaluating outcomes of your subtasks and your current state uh and enabling kind of adaptive replanning based on real-time feedback that occurs during the execution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of the plan so you know you have the plan so you know if you have rapidly changing environment or information this can occur especially in you know situations for us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">where there are other humans actively engaged in either a development process or some other workflow while your agent is executing perhaps a long-running workflow uh and so if you have you know you can honestly like find a lot of information about these techniques and kind of reason around you know you don't have to necessarily jump into the true like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">bayesian statistics predictive modeling stuff i think a lot of the like general ideas of replanning taking in the trajectory information and making sure that you keep that up to date</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">uh is honestly enough to see some like pretty solid quality improvements on your agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and then finally uh explicit plan criteria so i think you actually kind of see this pretty often for very simple agents and then people start to remove explicit plan criteria in order to increase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">generalizability uh but uh what we found is that clearly defining kind of successful structures or at least successful initial states</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">for plans uh can lead to a very strong kind of downstream effects uh and and you know this can be done in a lot of different ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">instruction tuning uh you know a few uh few shot prompt examples you can validate like your plans with different kind of hard-coded logic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">uh you know ultimately all of this is about error reduction and keeping your like trajectories as successful as possible as long as possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">uh but it's difficult to build and scale these because basically what i'm recommending is that you hard code a lot of logic into your system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">uh i think this is like a general idea that people maybe you know depending on your domain this may seem appealing or not appealing but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately we're probably not building agi like tomorrow or next week or in the next six months and so i think taking some of the lessons from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the kind of like symbolic era of ai is useful if you have like a domain challenge that you want to solve in the next three months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">uh for us you know we think about delivering real value to customers today and that means that a lot of what we do is thinking about things like explicit plan criteria</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">hard-coded logic uh and i think that a lot of folks may not like be open to admitting that but i think it's a very important part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the process of building these kind of agentic systems um so now talking about decision making and i know this is also meant to be kind of like a word vomit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">honestly because i think hopefully you guys are like building agents and you care a lot about this stuff and it can spark or inspire some ideas in your own systems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're working on them um so first for decision making consensus mechanisms uh there's a lot of these self-consistency is a very popular one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt ensembles cluster sampling you know basically the more inference at runtime that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">run and the more that you can like build a clever way of selecting ideal or optimal samples from those like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that let's say you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNYEc908oQ&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to make a
