So first, a couple weeks ago, there was an episode on lounges and accessing them. Two things that people sent in that I didn't mention. One, there is a card that you can't get directly called the Ritz-Carlton card from Chase.</p><p>But if you do have one of the Bonvoy cards from Chase, you can change to it after a year. And the reason I brought it up now is that people reminded me that it gets free authorized users and every cardholder has unlimited guests on Priority Pass. So that is a really cool lounge card we didn't talk about.</p><p>And then the next thing is, I hope this isn't a trend, but it looks like a few of the Priority Pass lounges are starting to charge a fee on top of just having the Priority Pass membership. I think the first one was the Virgin Lounge at LAX, but I just hope that's not a trend.</p><p>So that's a quick little follow-up to the lounge episode.</p></div></div></body></html>
