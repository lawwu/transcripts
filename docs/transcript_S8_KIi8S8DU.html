Just remember, you're the guy who put me on the map. I'll never forget that. Stay strong. Hi, Jonathan, Alan Roth here. First of all, thank you for everything you've done putting up with me for two decades. You've been instrumental to my career.</p><p>You've taught me and, more importantly, so many people an understanding of money and happiness and reaching financial independence and how to enjoy that financial independence. Thank you, my friend. - Hi, Jonathan. I'm Alice at the Bogglehead Conference, and I just wanna thank you so much for your Humboldt Hour webpage and wish you all the best.</p><p>Thank you again. - Hey, Jonathan, I miss you, Jane misses you, pretty much everybody else here misses you, too, and I'll see you in three or four months. - Jonathan, I just wanna say thank you for everything you've done on the Humboldt Dollar and for the Boggleheads with the Boggleheads.</p><p>I've personally appreciated it. I know many, many others have also, and I think the most important thing that I know has happened is that you've made a difference, and that's about the most important thing that anyone could do for anyone else. So thank you, I'm very grateful. - Jonathan, thank you so much for your incomparable contributions to empower individual investors, your digestible style of writing, your accessibility.</p><p>I am so grateful that you came and spoke to a New York City Boggleheads chapter meetup in person, incredibly generous with your time and knowledge and insights, and I secretly want for us to go for a bike ride, so I look forward to your recovery and more time together.</p><p>Thanks again for everything you do. - Jonathan, you know you have made such a big impact on me personally, on my career trajectory, and certainly about how I think about investing in personal finance. You've also been a big topic of conversation at this conference, so much discussion about the impact that you've had on individual investors, how you've helped improve their financial decision-making.</p><p>We ask the group here at the conference to share their thanks for you, and here's a video that they made. - Thank you, Jonathan! (dramatic music) (gentle music)</p></div></div></body></html>
