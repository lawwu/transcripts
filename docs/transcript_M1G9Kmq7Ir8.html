If you want to learn really anything huge fan of masterclass, we've partnered with them for a long time.</p><p>I've given it as multiple gifts. There's going to be a holiday promo on the gift guide. So I just think it's a really excellent gift, especially if you need a last minute idea because you can buy it online. But even if you don't, I think there's so many different things that anyone can learn from there.</p><p>And then last one that we've given to, I think every family member is story worth, which is basically a book that gets built over the year. So you send all of these prompts to someone in your family, you know, a parent, a grandparent. They answer these emails and you start to build these amazing stories from your family that you can pass down from generation to generation.</p></div></div></body></html>
