Is it surprising? In the '50s, a lot of countries that you would never have imagined were working on nuclear weapons. Sweden, Norway, Japan, South Korea, a lot of countries, they had the technology, they just didn't have the materials.</p><p>And it was dicey about what you should do. I interviewed some of the Swedish scientists who worked on their bomb. And I said, "So why did you give it up?" They said, "When the Soviets developed hydrogen bombs, it would only take two to destroy Sweden." So we didn't see much point.</p><p>And we signed then the Non-Proliferation Treaty, they said. And our knowledge of how to build nuclear weapons helped us deal with countries like South Africa, which did build a few bombs in the late 1980s. So efforts were starting up. And that's where John Kennedy got the numbers where he said, "I lose sleep at night" over the real prospect of there being 10 countries with nuclear weapons by 1970 and 30 by 1980.</p><p>And of course, that would have been a nightmare world because the risk of somebody using them would have gone up accordingly. But after the Cuban Missile Crisis, we and the Soviet Union basically said, "We've got to slow this thing down." And the treaty that was then put together and negotiated offered a good deal.</p><p>It said, "If you don't build nuclear weapons, we will give you the knowledge to build nuclear energy technology." There was a belief in the early years of nuclear weapons that as soon as the technology was learned by a country, they would immediately proceed to build the bomb. No one really thought it through.</p><p>It seems self-evident, but it wasn't self-evident. There are dangers to building a nuclear weapon and having an arsenal. If you're a little country and you have a nuclear arsenal, you have the potential to destroy a large country, or at least disable a large country, because you have these terribly destructive weapons.</p><p>That makes you a target. That means that large country is going to look at you and worry about you, which they never would have before. That kind of logic dawned on everybody at that point, and they were getting a good deal. And the other part of the deal was the part that the nuclear powers never kept to this day, which was an agreement that we would work seriously and vigorously toward nuclear disarmament.</p><p>We didn't do that. We just told them we would, and then snuck around on the sides. So much so that this treaty, no one was quite trusting of the whole deal. Treaties are usually signed, and they exist in perpetuity. They don't have any end date. They go on until somebody breaks the rules.</p><p>But this treaty was given a 25-year review period, which would have been 1995, at which point, if the countries had chosen to abrogate the treaty, it would have been set aside, and everybody could have gone back to making nuclear weapons. Now, it almost came to that for the very reason that the main nuclear powers had not fulfilled their agreement to start reducing arsenals.</p><p>We didn't start reducing our nuclear arsenal until the end of the Cold War, until the collapse of the Soviet Union. That's when we began cutting back, as did the former Soviet Union. A diplomat who's a friend of mine, Tom Graham, was assigned the task by our State Department of going around to the countries that were going to be voting on this renewal or not of the treaty, and convincing their leaderships around the world that it wasn't in their best interest to abrogate the treaty at that point.</p><p>Tom spent two years on the road. The only place he thought he should go is not the UN, where there's a second-level diplomat he could have talked to, but back to the home countries, and he convinced enough countries around the world. He's another hero who's never been properly celebrated.</p><p>He convinced enough countries around the world that they did agree to extend the treaty in perpetuity, with the proviso that the goddamn nine nuclear powers get busy eliminating their nukes. Of course, George H.W. Bush, bless him, I didn't like his politics otherwise, but he stepped forward and split the nuclear arsenal in half right away.</p><p>We dropped our numbers way lower than we had been. He pulled them out of South Korea, which was a great bugaboo for both the Soviets and the North Koreans, and China, and did a lot of good work toward moving toward a real reduction in nuclear arsenals, and the Russians agreed at that time.</p><p>It was before Putin took power. So there was a change for the better, but there are still too many around, unfortunately. So that's why there are only nine nuclear powers to this day.</p></div></div></body></html>
