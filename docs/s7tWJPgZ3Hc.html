And so he finally says in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWJPgZ3Hc&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">his story of his conversion, "Inexorably," this is a quote, "Inexorably, joy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWJPgZ3Hc&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">proclaimed, 'You want.'

In other words, that's what he finally came to, is that my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWJPgZ3Hc&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">desire is pointing beyond my desire, and if I don't discover the God beyond my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWJPgZ3Hc&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">desire, the true God who awakens all my desires, who satisfies all my desires, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWJPgZ3Hc&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">will live an endlessly frustrated life.
