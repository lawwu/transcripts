So what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">essence or perhaps the goal of spiritual growth that sinless Jesus was moving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">toward?" What would you say to Chris? Excellent question. So let me put a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">couple more passages of Scripture alongside Luke 2 52 so we can see how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">crucial the question really is. Luke 2 52 says, "And Jesus increased in wisdom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and in stature and in favor with God and man." So this is where Chris sees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">growth in Jesus' spiritual life. He increased, he increased in wisdom and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">increased in favor with God and so on. So there was some kind of movement, some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of growth, as Chris says. Now let's add to Luke 2 52, Hebrews 2 10. "It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">fitting that he, God, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to glory, that he should make the founder of their salvation perfect through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">suffering." So here we have God making Jesus perfect through suffering. So Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is in some sense moving toward perfection. And here's the one other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">verse, Hebrews 5 8 and 9. "Although he was a son," although Jesus was a son of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">God, "he learned obedience," catch that phrase, "he learned obedience through what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">he suffered, and being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to all who obey him." So if you put all those together, you have Jesus increasing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in wisdom, increasing in favor with God and man, being made perfect through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">suffering, learning obedience through what he suffered. And so Chris's question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is basically, what does all that mean if Jesus never sinned and therefore could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not progress from a state of some sinning to no sinning? Or to be more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">specific, what does it mean to learn obedience or to be made perfect? And why,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Chris asks, did Jesus pass through this? What's the goal? What is he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">moving toward if he's not ever sinning? So let's make sure that neither Chris, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">presume, nor I, neither of us is just arbitrarily assuming that Jesus never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sinned. Like, we've got a theology that he's sinless, and we're just gonna assume</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that he never sinned, and we're not gonna let these texts change our mind no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">matter what they say. No, no, no, no, no. We're not assuming this. We are reading it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the book of Hebrews. That's what makes it so significant. Hebrews, probably more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">than any other book in the New Testament, insists upon the sinlessness of Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, Hebrews 4:15, "We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect was tempted as we are, yet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">without sin." Same thing in 726, same thing in 914. So we're not assuming Jesus was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sinless. The writer who said he learned obedience said he never sinned. So he has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">created the problem, not us, and we're just trying to get inside the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_KgVhK6M&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">writer's head.
