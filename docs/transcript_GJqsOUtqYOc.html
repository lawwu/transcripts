i was recently watching an interview by joe rogan actually and he was talking about how homeland security is the team that invaded diddy's house yes do you have any knowledge on like why they went to his house and invaded it and do you have any knowledge on that situation i i have no direct knowledge of the investigation so i have not taken a part in it and if i had uh i would not be able to say it because it's an ongoing criminal investigation which right um so but what i can say is that i believe it involved sex trafficking uh of minors um that the reason it seemed like an overwhelming response to search a search warrant like why are you bringing um deals with kind of the people he has around protecting you know him and his property um you know their criminal histories things like that so you know if you have a security guard that you know has a previous homicide conviction and he's armed well the cops are going to treat your the search warrant in a different way um i can tell you that the level of probable cause that would go into getting the higher executives at homeland security had to sign off on that uh judge had to sign off on that the prosecutor's office had to sign off on that and knowing that it would be someone you know that's going to be high profile it's going to be able to hire 20 defense attorneys to try to pick everything apart yeah that it it would have to be a pretty solid affidavit and allegation for them to even go after like that yeah so the idea of hollywood and kind of these um um these people with these pedophilia rings and things like that um and that that truly takes place you know you got the jeffrey epstein case what are your thoughts on kind of the because that also is kind of a conspiracy that people think that kind of these higher up people are involved in these pedophilia rings and then you know you have the jeffrey epstein case and kind of the defendants in his case um which were a lot of really well-known individuals and things like that like what are your thoughts on that oh there's corruption like i have no doubt about that that that case is just wrought with problems like yeah uh like i had no involvement in it none whatsoever but but you've seen enough to know that that's yeah it stinks like yeah my question is this how do you charge jelaine maxwell in human trafficking when you can't prove who she trafficked a human to you have to have an end user right yeah to follow this right yeah so if i was going to sell drugs you would have to prove that i sold them to a person right yeah so if i'm going to traffic a person you'd have to prove that i sold it to a person yeah what in any documents came out of who these kids were trafficked to so you say you think it's false no i think they absolutely traffic kids and i think that there's oh you're saying the people on the receiving end that's the people we need to be going after yes yes the people who are having sex with the 14 year olds or the 16 year olds paying for it flying to an island like to to cross out of our country with the intent to have sex with a child is a felony you're going to do 10 years yeah like do you is the idea that there's these very powerful people whether it's politicians whether it's um hollywood movie stars or you know different people of that caliber that are really into this type of stuff do you do you think that to be the case i don't think so uh so i think that there is like true pedophilia so is prepubescent right that's 11 or under and i think most of the people in the epstein case the p diddy case you know whatever are probably going to be in that 14 to 18 range which is more called hebophilia um that somebody after the onset of puberty but still a child um so i think that's in those circles what the the problem or what their focus is what they're trying to get access to um and and i think in in the actual pedophilia the raping of children is a completely different thing and i don't think there are big rings where that's happening where people are are trafficking in two year olds or one month olds or those kind of things right okay so um because i actually you know just being around i i kind of think the opposite i kind of think there are a lot of people that you would never suspect and they're powerful people that have a great background and they would come off as super clean cut or whatever but on the side they're involved in some crazy things ryan garcia the boxer recently came out and talked about um how the bohemian grove i don't know if you know what that is i don't um it's basically yeah he said he was brought into the woods as um and and forced to watch you know some people might call him crazy whatever the bohemian grove is a real place um and kind of forced to watch you know people partake in you know this type of stuff with with children and he said himself he was he was raped as a young child um but i think it's interesting talking to someone who works certain of these cases and i don't know if it's that these people are so high up and so protected that they get away with it and you know the people that are kind of messy with it and the ones that are kind of like um leave too many things behind are the ones that get caught but i kind of of think it goes a lot higher and deeper than people suspect.</p></div></div></body></html>
