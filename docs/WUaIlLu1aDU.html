So back in November, I filed an appeal. I paid a $30 fee where I only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">needed to put my stated value on a form. So there was the register value that they said my home was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">worth and based the property taxes on. I said it was worth a number that was 23% lower than that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">number. Now I'd done some work to support that value, looking at sales comps from the assessing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">date, which for our county was January 1st, 2023, and then I built a little spreadsheet model to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">adjust those prices based on the fluctuating average home price data in the zip code I'm in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that I got from Zillow, which kind of means if some sale happened in October and then the assessor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">date is January 1st, I looked at how home prices changed between October and January 1st and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">adjusted them accordingly. And then also I looked at how the individual houses might have differed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from mine, mostly in terms of square footage, but could be from other features. So that's how I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">arrived at a number that ended up being about 23% lower than what the county valued my home at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And a few months later, once the county had entered my appeal into the system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I followed up and emailed the assessor that spreadsheet. So the first application just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">needed a number, but I wanted to defend that number. So I emailed the spreadsheet and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, here's this information." They said, "We're not going to do any of this until you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hearing date set." So that hearing date was set for July 11th. And sure enough, on June 27th,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just a couple of weeks before, I got an email that said my value was warranted and the price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">would be reduced. I honestly couldn't believe it. I had expected that I would need to negotiate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe they would come in and say, "Hey, actually 10%." And I'd say, "15." But I didn't. They just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">took my price, which was a 23% reduction. And ultimately my property taxes, which I've already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">paid, will be reduced by that amount. And I believe I will get a refund check for that amount,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which in the Bay Area, 23% reduction can be thousands of dollars. Now I had assumed incorrectly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that in California, when you reduce your home's value for property tax, it would carry forward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">into the future based on this Prop 8 that we have, that property taxes don't get reassessed each year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But sadly, that's not the case. You can appeal the base value of your home, which is the price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">by which it adjusts with a very low cost of living adjustment over time. But in order to do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to argue that the purchase price that you paid wasn't actually a fair price at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really hard to do that if you had a free market transaction. Maybe you could argue that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">your real estate agent deceived you and led you to make an unfair offer, but it's very difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm going to do, as long as interest rates are high, and I believe that our home could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">argued to be undervalued, is just find a few sales comps every year in our neighborhood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">use the same model that I have or a new model to update that amount and file an appeal every year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">until the market prices of homes actually exceeds what's on the books. Eventually in California,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that'll happen because the Prop 8 limitations kind of really keep your property tax not much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">higher than what you paid for. So in some number of years, this will stop being a thing. But until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then, I'm going to file this each year. And if you live in other states, it can be even more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">lucrative.

If you don't want to deal with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the hassle of going through all of the state and county rules, building your own models that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">support evaluation, filling in the documents, check out OwnWell.

I mentioned in episode 175, how we managed to find five seats one way to Paris in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">business class this summer for 45,000 Air France points, plus about $300 in taxes per person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but we didn't actually have a return. And so I just set up some alerts with award tool and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">seats.arrow. And sure enough, we got an alert a couple of weeks ago that five seats popped up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on United direct from Amsterdam to San Francisco, just 12 days after we arrived in Paris, which was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect timing for us. But it introduced an interesting decision that I thought sharing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with you would be really valuable because where you book the flight has such a big impact on how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">much it costs. So despite that this was a United flight, I could have booked it through most other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Star Alliance carriers. So I narrowed it down to a few options. First was just book it on United</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for 80,000 points, plus $93 in taxes per person, free cancellation, which was an awesome benefit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can get United points transferring from chase or built one-to-one. So I almost just did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that not remembering about all of these other options. And then it dawned on me to go check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And sure enough, there were some really compelling ones. So first off, I could have just booked it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on Air Canada, same flight as United, but only 70,000 points and $144 in taxes per person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, because of a 20% transfer bonus, it would only end up costing 58,333 chase points. Sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to round up to make sure you transfer an even number. And that number would have gone even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">lower if I had a chase Aeroplan card, because they were offering a 30% transfer bonus. The issue here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">was that it came with a cancellation fee. So that cancellation fee is 150 Canadian dollars or 110</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">US dollars. However, one of the great features of Aeroplan is that when you're booking a flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you kind of get two choices. You can pay more points and get a flexible free cancellation ticket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So for 85,000 points, you got free cancellation, and I wouldn't risk having to pay anything if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">needed to change or cancel in the future. Now, with that transfer bonus of 20%, it would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">only been 71,833 points plus the $144 in taxes to book a refundable flight on Air Canada that roughly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">matched what was happening on United because United has free cancellation. So that means that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm paying about $50 more in taxes to save about 8,000 points. So already that's comparable. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a few people shared with me a trick that I didn't know about. And that's that when you go to change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">an Aeroplan itinerary, you don't lose the space that you've secured if you add on another leg,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but you do get to reprice things. And so if you add on a leg that wouldn't change the overall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">price. So for us, maybe we add on San Francisco to LA. Well, now we get to reprice it. And at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">point in time, we could choose to reprice it as the non-refundable version and get back those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">15,000 points. And so that's one option we thought about was, okay, well, let's switch to Amsterdam,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to San Francisco, and then add on a flight to LAX or some other place on the West coast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not really going to change the price. We would just grab our bags in SFO,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">not take that last leg. So that is one option. The other option would be while we still have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a flexible flight, we could change it to have an LA leg for the same 85,000 points and then change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it back to have a direct flight, not include the leg and ask them if they could change it to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">70,000 point version and get back those 15,000 points. So haven't played with that trick would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">encourage people to try search around online. And that would be a great option. And actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">another benefit of this option for us was that back when built had a 100% transfer bonus to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Aeroplan, I transferred a bunch of built points over. So I had almost all the points I needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at a hundred percent transfer bonus and being able to get this flight for 70,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">points, then that was effectively a cost of 35,000 points, at least built points for this flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was an amazing deal. So it seemed like the obvious choice, but there was a third option</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">worth considering. And that was with Avianca Life Miles. Now through Life Miles, the starting price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was only 63,000 points plus $115 in taxes. And there was a 15% transfer bonus from Amex, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">would have brought the total to just shy of 55,000 points, which is better than Aeroplan, better than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">United. Similar to Aeroplan though, there is a hefty cancellation fee. So $200 per person, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">given the uncertainty we had on this trip, we weren't really willing to risk having to cancel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">five tickets and paying $1,000. However, Avianca has the Life Miles plus subscription, which can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">come in tremendous handy in these situations. So for $30 a month, you subscribe to Life Miles plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">basic and that gets you free cancellation. It also gets you 2000 miles per month deposited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">into your account. And you get a 10% rebate on award flights. The only catch is you need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">subscribe for six months at a minimum. So that means for us $30 a month, six months, $180. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">if you kind of split it out over the five tickets we were booking, it's 36 extra dollars per person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but you would get back a total of 31,500 miles because you're getting that 10% rebate. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">would earn 2000 points per month for the next six months, which is another 12,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, I would need to transfer the whole total of about 55,000 points per person over to book the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">flights, but I would end up with 43,500 Life Miles left over. So you could argue that the total cost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">was only 232,000 points, which is only 46,000 points per person. So here I was starting at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">United at 80,000 points, reducing that cost all the way down to potentially 46,000 points for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">exact same flight, which is amazing. So the Life Miles deal is a great example of how much better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a deal you can get if you dig a little bit further. And like I said earlier, I almost just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">booked the United flight without thinking, so I'm glad I didn't. The final comparison, United at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">80,000 points plus $93, Aeroplan at 58,000 or 72,000 points, at least ultimate rewards points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on whether I wanted to be able to cancel it. And then Life Miles at 55,000 or 46,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on whether I wanted to pay the extra $36 per person to get Life Miles plus on top of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the $115 taxes per person. So from my standpoint, the Life Miles deal was absolutely the best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's what I would have done because how often do you get to book five international</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">business class flights between the West Coast and Europe for less than 250,000 total points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">under $150 a person in taxes and fees, including that Life Miles plus subscription. So I absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">would have done that, except that I had already transferred points to Aeroplan back when built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">had that a hundred percent bonus and I had no current plan for them. So I decided to go with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the Aeroplan route and I booked it at the changeable cancelable 85,000 point level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will get back to you in the future.

Now, the irony of all of this is that I actually forgot to turn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">off all the alerts after I booked this flight. And then three days later, Air France popped up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on the exact same day for Paris to San Francisco flights for only 50,000 Air France miles. Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the taxes and fees were about $275. So greater than all the other options, but for a simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">choice, not even requiring a transfer bonus, which oftentimes there are to Air France was another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">great option.

Now I've talked before about how great companion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">passes because for the year you earn it and the entire next year, you get to select one person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and they fly free with you only paying taxes and fees, which can be as low as $5 and 60 cents per</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">flight. And you can change your companion up to three times a year. Now, normally it takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">135,000 Southwest points to earn companion pass. However, unlike many other programs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the points you earn through the Southwest credit card do count. And just having the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Southwest credit card reduces what you need to 125,000. So often the strategy is to open up a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">personal and a business card and get the welcome bonus on both. And that'll get you to your 125,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">points. Now the timing of this is really important because if you're going to get it the year you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">earn the bonus and the entire next year, you'd much rather earn it in January or February than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">December. And so I always advocate people try to earn those two bonuses or all the points you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">as early in the year as possible. And it's based on when the statement closes on the statement that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you hit the spend to get the bonus. So you want to be really careful here because one time about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe six, seven years ago, I mistakenly spent too much on a card and I hit one of the bonuses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in December and the next bonus in January.

Category two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is for depositing anywhere from about $10,000 to $50,000, getting a bonus of anywhere from $100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to $900.

But on the other bonuses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're depositing much less, there are so many. At just national banks, maybe it's a dozen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or two dozen, but if you start including local credit unions, which the Doctor of Credit page has,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there are so many bonuses that you could probably do this 20 times a year if you wanted to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, most of them range in the hundred to kind of 200, 500 range, some as high as 750.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I mentioned earlier, there's at least a couple that are pushing close to a thousand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but don't require a six-figure deposit.

When I looked at these individually and thought, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">well, this one I might earn $400. Yes, I have to pay taxes on it. How much hassle is it worth?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It crossed my mind that, "Is my time really worth this? I don't know." But then I thought, "Wow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2213" target="_blank">00:36:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if you could really get a system going that made this pretty straightforward and every four months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you did it, you and a P2 could get to about $12,000 a year." All of a sudden, that's sounding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">very, very different. Spending a few hours for $500, depending on your wealth and your income,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">may or may not be a good deal. But doing it, figuring out the system that makes it really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">simple, and then repeating it throughout the year with your P2 to earn $12,000 a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. It seems really, really interesting. I'll let you be the judge of whether it's worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">your time, but I could definitely see it making sense for lots of people. Or even just waiting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for the really outsized ones.

But waiting for really big bonuses, just like you might wait for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">really big signup bonuses on a credit card, is not necessarily a bad option here as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The nice thing here though, is that unlike credit cards where you're having hard inquiries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're dealing with card application rules, it is much, much easier to get approved for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bank account. And they're not doing hard inquiry polls on your credit that's going to affect your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">interest rates in the future. So that's bank bonuses. Let's last look at brokerage bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This one's a bit more interesting to me, because instead of having to move around money and make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2293" target="_blank">00:38:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sure your cashflow needs are in order, you can actually just transfer positions that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">holding of stocks or index funds. And while they're in transit, you're not foregoing your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">earnings or any growth in those stocks. And you don't really need access to them on a day-to-day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">basis. So it's a little bit easier in my mind than a bank bonus, because it's kind of less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">invasive into your cashflow. So to evaluate these, I looked at 20 different brokerage bonuses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and some of them were household names, Schwab, Citi, E-Trade. Some were fintechs like Robinhood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Webull, and Public. And some were brokerages that I wasn't really familiar with, like Tasty Trade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and Trade Station. All were brokerages with SIPC protection, which usually protects you, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on $500,000 of balance. Similar, but not the same as FDIC insurance. So none of these were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">non-protected brokerage firms, but some of them were ones I didn't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2347" target="_blank">00:39:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And what really kicked this off was that when I started doing this research, Robinhood at the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">was offering a 1% bonus on all transfers. And so I really started thinking, "Is that something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to take advantage of?" I had missed when they had previously offered a IRA bonus even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">higher, but I'll come back to that at the end. And then I really wanted to do my diligence. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to make sure I wasn't just looking at bonuses now. So I went to this thread on Bogleheads,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is kind of an index fund investing community. And I found a thread on brokerage bonuses with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">over 8,000 posts. So I wanted to be able to read them, but I definitely didn't want to take the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">time to read 8,000 posts. And so I went to ChatGPT and I said, "Hey, could you help me build a tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that would crawl this website and grab all 8,000 posts and save them?" And it did. And so I built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a little tool that I ran that did that. And then once I had all of those posts saved, I went back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to ChatGPT. I said, "Hey, here are 8,000 posts. They're all posts about brokerage bonuses. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to collect all the brokerage bonuses that paid out over $1,000. And can you build me a table</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of them with what all of them were?" And so ChatGPT made a table and put them all together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I could process all of them alongside all the bonuses that are out right now. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the good news is that the bonuses that are out right now are pretty competitive with the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">all-time offers. So there aren't that many all-time amazing offers that were missed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Though, depending on how you view the repeatability of some of these things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2439" target="_blank">00:40:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you might find that some of the Robinhood offers were kind of better, but it actually depends on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how you look at them. So we'll get to that. Now, the good news is that of all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">all-time best offers, they're not that different from offers you can get today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure, the Robinhood offers aren't around anymore, but there are some pretty similar offers from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Webull. And in fact, both of those offers aren't as good as some of the other offers that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">going to talk about, depending on what your balances are. So the range of offers is also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really wide. Some firms require you to deposit securities for three months, some as long as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">five years, but most of them are in the three to 12 month range. And the minimum amount of securities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that you needed to transfer in or deposit was as low as $50. But some of them were percentage-based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with no caps. Theoretically, your bonus could be five, six, even seven figures if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">transferring enough money. And the way I thought about these was a little bit of a twofold method.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">One, you could look at just the amount of the bonus relative to the account balance you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">be transferring, but it also comes down to how much you want to repeat this each year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Unlike the bank bonuses, where they're almost all 90 days, here, you might get a little bit more for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a bonus that's 12 months or 24 months, and that might be worth the fact that you don't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2516" target="_blank">00:41:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">repeat this if you don't want to. Okay, so here's what I found. For balances under $100,000, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">very similar to bank bonuses, where the amount you're going to earn ranged from about $100 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">$938, and that required a three-month to 24-month holding period. For the most part, the annualized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">yield, meaning if something was only three months, multiplying it by four, was anywhere from three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to 4%. Now, when you go down to balances in the $50 to $500 range, some of the annualized APYs went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wild because E*TRADE is going to give you $100 for a balance of $50, which ends up being about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">400% APY because you only need to have those funds there for six months. But once you start getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">past the $5,000 mark, everything gets a little bit more easier to compare. And the takeaway for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2570" target="_blank">00:42:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a balance that's under $100,000 is that E*TRADE and TD are probably the best options if you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to repeat this because they require three to six months, and they're decent bonuses. If you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">want to repeat it that frequently, Webull and T*TRADE probably had the best earnings for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUaIlLu1aDU&t=2588" target="_blank">00:43:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">longer holding period.
