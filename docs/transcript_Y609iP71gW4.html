Like you look at the world chess champion Magnus Carlsen, who by objective, by which I mean AI measurements, is probably the strongest human player who ever lived. He's not god. He's not infinitely smart. He starts off on a chessboard with no more resources than you have, and he predictably wipes the board with you, because he doesn't have to be godlike to defeat you, or me, to be clear.</p><p>I also can be defeated by being short of godhood. Magnus Carlsen can't make diamond nanobots. Do we agree on that statement? Not quickly. I'm not sure what happens if you give him a million years to work on it. Then I'm not sure what happens. I agree that he probably can't do it quickly.</p><p>Okay.</p></div></div></body></html>
