Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office. But like I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2178">00:36:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">said, probably all of us have a master.

I got excited. But Stanley just couldn't do it. He considered the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2199">00:36:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">possibility of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours. He might be fired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2205">00:36:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for that. And in such a competitive economy, why had he taken that risk? All because he believed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2211">00:36:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone had vanished. His boss would think he was crazy. And then something occurred to Stanley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2218">00:36:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe, he thought to himself, maybe I am crazy. All of my co-workers blinking mysteriously out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2224">00:37:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of existence in a single moment for no reason at all. None of it made any logical sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2230">00:37:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And as Stanley pondered this, he began to make other strange observations. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2236">00:37:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">why couldn't he see his feet when he looked down? Why did doors close automatically behind him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2242">00:37:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">wherever he went? And for that matter, these rooms were starting to look pretty familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2247">00:37:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Were they simply repeating? No, Stanley said to himself, this is all too strange. This can't be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2253">00:37:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">real. And at last, he came to the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue. He just hadn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2259">00:37:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">found the words for it.

His co-workers weren't actually gone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2275">00:37:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He wasn't going to lose his job.

And then perhaps the strangest question of them all entered Stanley's head. One, he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2315">00:38:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner. Why is there a voice in my head dictating everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2321">00:38:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm doing and thinking? Now the voice was describing itself being considered by Stanley,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2327">00:38:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who found it particularly strange.

And while he thought it all very odd and wondered if this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2340">00:39:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">voice spoke to all people in their dreams, the truth was that of course, this was not a dream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2346">00:39:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">How could it be?

After all, he knew for certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2365">00:39:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond a doubt that this was in fact a dream. Did the voice not see him float and make the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2369">00:39:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">magical stars just a moment ago?

This voice was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEIr4wtVvU&t=2374">00:39:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">part of himself too.
