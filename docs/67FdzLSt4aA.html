So as Hamill mentioned, we're going to be using NBDev today, which works with Quarto to take a bunch of Jupyter notebooks and to turn it into a complete software package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to walk through how we would go about doing that from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually much more exciting than that, but...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Go on, get us excited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not only will we create a software package, but we'll show you how you can get a documentation site, a beautiful documentation site that's searchable for free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll get CI for free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll get an amazing way to do unit tests and testing all within the same context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something that has made me more productive, at least 10 times more productive, while building all kinds of different software projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been using NBDev for about four years now, or three years, and I've made a lot of different types of software, everything from CLI apps to API clients to...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've worked on extensions of the Python programming language with Jeremy and a bunch of other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's interesting how many different use cases that it's a really good fit for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's wonderful, so I'm really excited to show it to everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What about you, Jeremy? How do you feel?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the big thing for me is I don't really enjoy writing software very much, but I'm not using NBDev now because I don't get as much get into that flow state, which is such a pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Using a notebook, because I'm doing exploratory programming, I'm really in the zone the whole time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I very rarely have mysterious bugs, because everything along the way I've built an exploratory way, I know exactly how it works, and it's very easy to fix any problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm in this continuous zone of productivity, which feels enjoyable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had various ways of trying to achieve something like that before NBDev existed, but I never had the same experience that this gives me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing, as you mentioned, is you get all this stuff for free, so the fact that I can quickly whip out in a couple of hours a complete project with continuous integration tests, documentation, PIP installers, all that stuff is pretty cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what we're going to build today, just a fun little sample project. It's not going to do anything interesting, this one. It's going to be based on this book, Think Python, by Alan Downey, which is a really great book, and we're going to build a deck of cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're basically going to be inspired by the deck of cards idea that comes from his book to do a bit of programming in Python and we're going to end up with a documentation site, a Conda package, a PyPy package, tests, and continuous integration, which before this video is finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I missing anything, Hamel? Is that what we're going to have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we're going to have all done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Great. So the starting point for creating an nbdev package is to create a repository.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The smoothest path is generally to use GitHub. It's not strictly required.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we are on GitHub. I'll go ahead and create a repository and call it nbdevcards, for example. Give it a description.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Apache license, create the repo. There it is. Okay. So that's step one. So what we're going to do now is we're going to clone this repo and turn it into an nbdev repository.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll click the copy button. I'm going to head over to my terminal and we'll clone it. That repo, nbdevcards, and this is assuming that I've already got nbdev installed. So to install nbdev, you can follow directions on the home page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a written tutorial, and just above it, you'll see the PIP install or condor install commands you can use. nbdev is very, very lightweight. It has very few dependencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Dependencies are basically fast core and exec nb. That's about it. You don't even need Jupyter or anything to run it. Obviously, to author stuff, you'll need Jupyter. But yeah, it's a very lightweight library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you've got it installed, if you type nbdev underscore and hit tab, you'll find that there's a bunch of command line tools that it's installed for you. And so you can get a list of them here on the nbdev main docs page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the one we're going to use is nbdev new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can also see a list of them anytime if you do nbdev help in the terminal as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You get a shortened description along them. Great. And, you know, this is actually a good example, Hamel, of how we don't have to do anything to keep our documentation up to date, because our documentation being an nbdev is written in nbdev.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the documentation actually uses exclamation mark. That means run a shell command in Jupyter, followed by that shell command, and the output here. So the output in our documentation will always be up to date,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's running the actual code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is huge, because like the way that most people create documentation is they copy and paste code into markdown and they copy and paste the output into markdown and it becomes stale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It becomes a big headache and that's why nobody writes documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is why I take care. nbdev is for lazy people like me. I'm very lazy and I'm not prepared to do things twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so nbdev new, so you can pass -h to any nbdev command to find out how to use it. In this case, it's very, very simple. You just this got no command line arguments so you just go ahead and just run nbdev here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So as you can see here, when I run nbdev new, it figures out all the details of my repo and it creates a file called settings.any and settings.any is your home for all the stuff that you need for your app or your library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the neat thing about this for a lazy person like me is that you only have to put this stuff in one place at one time like the version number and your details and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it means that you don't have to worry about putting these things in multiple places for your documentation for your PyPy install or whatever it's all going to come from one place you don't have to worry about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is great. Otherwise, you know, like package management has so much boilerplate, it's overwhelming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this makes it to where you can actually do it because it like it stays sane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the next thing we're going to do then is create, let's see what we've got here so it's given us an OO core notebook, an index notebook, a readme, a setup, and some style sheet info so we'll learn about what all these things are in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's start by opening up the homepage that you're going to be using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So index.i.py.mb is going to become your homepage, as you can see, and OO core homepage for what homepage for the docs. Yeah, I'm going to your website. Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And also become like the first thing that you create for your library. And we only really, well we're going to use a couple of modules so that's, that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, I think for this one we're not necessarily going to have one called core I think we're going to have cards and a deck, we're going to put them just for explanation into two different modules so maybe we'll create cards first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe we'll rename this to OO cards or card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to say something about the OO in front? Does that mean anything to you? I mean, I like, yeah, I think it's helpful to have things have some ordering, like the order in which things are designed to be a read and be built, like, not so much how the software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">builds it but how you built it so that you know the nice thing about this kind of literate programming approach is that because the documentation is the source because the source code are notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody who wants to get up to speed on your library is reading notebooks, you know, and in fact you know nbdev is a good example of that. So if we go to the GitHub repo for nbdev and we're like okay well let's learn about how this software is written, I can start on the very first one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, that's, that's what I need to start reading to start understanding how this is written. And, you know, I can start. Okay, so here's what the settings.ini is and here's where it comes from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, even better might be if we look at exec nbdev, which is the library that we've written to help work with notebooks, because you can really see if we start at the very start here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like literally, you know, it's pros, because like this is my expiration when I started writing this is like what's a notebook so I started opening them and reading them and printing out what's in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So therefore when you know when you the reader start reading my code, you're following me on my journey of understanding. Yeah, what what's, what's going on at every step and then you can see when I've written a function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can understand why I've written that function because I've just explored up to a point where we can see that's the function I now need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, nbdict is basically doing things that I've just done, step by step in pros.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, that's the main thing you know the ordering of the file names is also used by default to order the table of contents in your documentation so that's another good reason to have it make some sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the only reason I'm using those numbers there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, we're also going to have a deck of cards. So we'll call this one, or one deck. So that's going to be a homepage that's going to be a module for cards this will be a module for decks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In real life I would probably be putting these in the same module because they're not going to be very big but this is just good for demo I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So each notebook is going to produce one.py file, one module.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do you want that module to be called, this is going to go up here so there's, you'll see there's some special comments here in the notebook they always start with hash pipe and if you've ever used quarter before this will look very familiar, because in quarter, it's exactly the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see special comments with hash pipe here as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So these comments that are used in quarter and nb dev are used to tell quarter or nb dev something about this code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, we'll be learning about show doc in a moment and we have to import show doc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the fact that we're doing that is something that the reader of your documentation doesn't care about. So we hide this from the documentation that's built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this special one here called default x this is the default export. This is what we're going to export symbols here into what module, we're going to import it into a module called card.py.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is marked down in our notebook. And so this is where we can start typing things that we want to appear, both for the reader of our source code, and also it's going to end up in our documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we could write, for example, a basic playing card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A simple API for creating and using playing cards. So this is the description.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be worth the point that this having this header one in this note block is a kind of an nb dev shortcut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what happens is this becomes the title of your page and that that quote block becomes the description of your page when it renders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, maybe a good way to understand how this works is to look at a library. So let's take exec nb again and open up one of its notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take 01nb.io. And at the same time, also open up its rendered documentation. And so you'll see here we've got nb.io and shell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here in the documentation here they are nb.io and shell. And if we look at the notebook, you can see here is the header one. So that's become the title and the contents and the description here has come from the description.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's used in things like the metadata of the page as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see the title, for example, gets built from that automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a good way to kind of understand how to use nb dev and how your choices, make things appear is by looking at the sample. And then you'll see each of the second level headings ends up as and third level headings ends up as in the table of contents here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I kind of like to think about, well, how do I, how do I want my, how do I want this to behave, you know, and so we're basically going to be, we're going to be creating a playing card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to want to have some kind of like, something which I could do, like, create a card passing it like a numeric suit and a rank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we could create, you know, a list of suits for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's pop that up here maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've now got a bunch of suits so you could like say suits one example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is that not printing out anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it something about the font, perhaps, or.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, something about pythons Unicode handling maybe that would be my computer it actually visually looks different than this. I don't get colored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I don't. Okay. Like, yeah, I don't ever see these colors or anything on my computer when on the same notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is where like nb dev is really helpful right because, you know, I'm not going to end up with some weird bug deep in my code because I'm exploring as I go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You could like split things. Okay, so I think what we'll do instead since we discovered that doesn't work, which I think just shows my ignorance about how Python uses Unicode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's put them create a list of strings instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, that's more like what I was expecting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess is maybe I think like some emojis are actually like consists of multiple kind of code points or something I don't quite remember the terminology and it kind of ends up changing the color, like you know like a flag or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that's, that's useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So then we're going to have all the different card ranks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there isn't really a rank zero so it's got a placeholder there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this this code is kind of loosely based on Alan Downey's book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So cool. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so if we want to create a class that represents a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll say we want a class, and it represents a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we create one of these Python calls that under in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you create an object of a class. And so we're going to be passing in some suit and some rank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then we'll just be setting self dot dot suit, just to store it away basically and self dot rank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So with the suit and the rank. Now I should mention like, as you all know, Hamill the way I, the way I write code is different to like the way most people write Python code, and in particular, there's a lot of like specific recommendations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and how to write Python code in a document called pep eight, which is kind of like a default style guide for Python code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah folks who are working in an organization that uses Pepe, they don't take my particular approach to coding as a role model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say though that I've been coding for 40 years now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And coding nearly every day for 30 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And my particular approach to coding is not random, there's a particular reason for it, which I've documented on the fast AI coding style, and it based on kind of many decades of work from people much smarter than me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Particularly, Ken Iverson the Turing Award winner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to say, yeah, I like my way of coding and that's what I'm going to show here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're working in an organization that uses Python in a more traditional way, you should go with your own organization's coding style.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The style that I've developed, as I said, it's partly based on years of research from other languages decades of research it's also partly based on experience with exploratory and literate programming in particular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So more closely follows the kind of style you would see from Lisp or APL or Julia programmers or F# programmers like programming languages that were working in the REPL working in an interactive and exploratory way is more a part of the culture and toolkit of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, of that environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I say something about this? Right. So, you know, I think it's important if you are interested in nbdev to approach it with the right mindset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think one mindset that's been helpful for a lot of people is to, you know, look at the things that we're showing you today as a dialect of Python because not only are we, you know, going to show you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, this way of developing code in a notebook, but there's also, you know, there are some extensions to the Python programming language that Jeremy has made that that kind of enhance the REPL experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you think of it as a dialect, then you can kind of open up your mind to, you know, a different different ways of working and also different conventions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's really important. Yeah, makes sense. So while you're talking, I was just starting to fill in the kind of like information I would want to be passing on to a reader of my code or documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great. I think this is like really is this is super powerful for many reasons like often I find that when I'm writing the documentation like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I discover bugs in my code or I discovered clunky things in my code like hey this is very hard to explain and end up refactoring it because of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, definitely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So try to explain in our docs as we go why things are as they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so there's a nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, so now we can create a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's not very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's the that's the default representation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can override that using done to STR which is a done to stir, which is the Python way of saying this is how I want to stringify my object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think a simple way to do this would be just to use an f string and say this is like a first of all the rank. So that would be the self rank, and then we would want to look that up in all the ranks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we'd want to do something similar for suits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And so that's what we're going to see if we print it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like so. Now, as you'll see it's a little bit different to how it's represented in a notebook. So quite often I like my notebook representation to be the same as how it's printed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an easy way to do that is by default, Jupiter will use the dunder Repra method to return the representation in the notebook so if I just say I want this to be the same as the string version, I can just do that, as we see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, so we can say, so we can add some documentation here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A playing card, given by passing in a single rank from ranks and search from suits. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an example of creating and displaying a card. And for the attentive people that are really playing close attention, these back ticks that Jeremy put in his doc string is keep that in the back of your mind that's actually doing something special, and you'll see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean we can look at it now so what's going to happen automatically is this is going to be turned into documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, if we look at this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good example. So here's a function called dict two nb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see here that it's created some documentation. And in fact we could make the documentation nice. Well let's take a look at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this the documentation is going to auto generate, it's going to call this function called show doc you actually don't have to put it in here manually it'll do it automatically when we build the docs but you can kind of get a bit of a preview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's nice to do is to give each parameters and documentation. So to do that you can use something we invented called documents. And this works like so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You basically put a comment after a parameter and say and give it a comment so an index into suits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so kind of nice because I can now make my doc string, a bit simpler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can say passing in rank and suit because you can already already see that they're right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So really at this point we can strip it all the way back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and having like, in my opinion having over lever verbose documentation isn't a good idea if you have more information than needed, then you know it's it's distracting to the reader, you want the right amount of information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So at this point, you can see here, this is how it's going to be represented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the exact information I want very clear. And so the other thing we might then do is say well what what what type is expected. Okay, so that way you don't have to include that in the doc string, because again when we spit out this show doc, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">both in the table, and also in the signature. So this again it's me being lazy. I don't want to include any more information than I, and I have to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As I say we don't actually need this here to be auto added for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So after a while you kind of get used to what things look like so you don't need it but if you do add it, it's fine, it will say that you've added it, it won't add it twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So an advanced feature we won't necessarily be discussing today is, you know, you can document other code bases with show doc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you know, there's another reason you might want to use it. Exactly. So you might create docs for something that you've written without nb dev, okay docs for somebody else's library, and that would be done by using show doc and importing their library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if we wanted to, you know, document something from exec nb for example, I could import something like that thing we were just looking at, you know, and start writing some markdown prose and also add wherever I wanted to the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">documentation, and this bit here this header show doc blah is not going to appear the only thing that appears in the documentation is the markdown output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think you know in general we probably want to be able to recognize, you know, when when cards are the same or when they're less than or greater than some other card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I kind of like to do for that is I kind of like creating tests to check that it's working correctly you can either create them before or after it doesn't really matter too much with exploratory programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would kind of be saying things so you can import some basic testing functionality from fast core.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're again this approach of importing wildcards it's like, not the normal approach in a lot of Python libraries but for exploratory programming it works pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's certainly not unheard of like for example the Python standard library itself has a really famous library called TK enter, and you'll see that all of the examples in it actually use wildcard imports, so it's actually used in the Python standard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's, it's only a good idea it like it's something you'd only want to do for libraries that are explicitly designed to work this way, because there's a somewhat advanced Python feature called done to all which ensures that things work correctly when you do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Normally that's a lot of work to create, and not really worth the effort and be dev libraries do it automatically. So one nice thing about nb dev libraries is that they work very well in rep or oriented programming because they'll support using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">wildcard imports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, it's something which if you're at an organization that uses kind of Pepe and stuff, you might want to explicitly import each thing carefully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One nice thing about exploratory programming is for people that aren't very familiar with the idea they often, like, don't know where symbols come from or what they mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, there's a thing in fast core test core test for quality test tech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In Jupiter, you don't have to worry about like you don't have to look up the top to find it because at any point you can just stick a question mark after it, and it will tell you exactly where it came from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And furthermore, you can actually just put a second question mark and that'll give you the source code for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can write it without any question marks, and it will just tell you the details of the source and the parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can just hit open parenthesis and then shift tab, and you'll get all the information here. So there's lots of ways, you know, in a rebel based environment of getting all this information without scrolling around and wasting time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to test that for example, a card like that should be equal to a card like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas a card with a different suit should not be equal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a card with a different rank should not be equal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so if we run that it doesn't work, because we haven't defined a quality yet so the way you define a quality in Python is by defining a dunder equality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we could just check that the two tuples are the same so if we check that self.suit, self.rank equals, oh we don't need b, it's going to be past the self, yourself and then one other thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And check that against a.suit, a.rank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. So they all pass. Now, we're not showing like totally perfect software engineering principles here we should be checking that the types are the same and stuff like that but we could at least give some indication that the types are meant to be a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a slightly weird Python thing that Python doesn't know what a card is when you're inside a card. So nowadays you have to put it in quotes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, I tend to like having my functionality all in one place though. So what I would tend to do at this point is I would often split this out so in Jupyter you can hit ctrl shift hyphen to split a cell out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I'd quite like to kind of have all this stuff defined down here in one place, so I'd have like equals, not equal, you know, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So to define a method outside of its class, which is kind of something that's pretty common in things like C++, for example, you can also do it in Python, using something from another thing from fast core.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the main things in fast core, inside its utils, and one of the things that will give us is something called patch. So we can add a quality to fast core just by saying patch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're just going to say what do you want to patch, I want to patch card. And one nice thing is now that actually exists I don't need this weird quote thing anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I now can I define, I can define, as you can see here I've defined card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I've patched in a quality.

So I'm just going to run this in the background for leave that running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you just type nb dev underscore test, and that's going to basically make sure all of your tests pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2481" target="_blank">00:41:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we don't like to give you more information than needed so it just tells you if they do. Let's break one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can see now it tells you that in 00 card cell 20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My colors could be better, but I'll fix that my term sometime shows you exactly where the problem occurs and it expected three of hearts, and it got a three of diamonds and you can see it even uses the correct representation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks to fast for test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the end it'll summarize a list of any notebooks that failed. So we'll go and fix that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Save it. We run our test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2520" target="_blank">00:42:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to see what you can pass in, it'll run the tests in parallel, using as many workers as you have CPUs by default. You can see how long they take to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can look at just particular files, so forth. There's lots of options you can do it. I was going to say, when you're using nb dev and you're debugging in real life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's worth it to mention the hotkey for reload in run all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah, definitely. That's really useful. Yeah, exactly. So you want because when you run nb dev test it's going to run your notebook from top to bottom. So to rerun your notebook from top to bottom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you just hit 00 that restarts the kernel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2562" target="_blank">00:42:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there isn't a hotkey built in for running all cells, but it's a good idea to add one by hitting help at a keyboard shortcuts around them all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're all good to go. A lot of, I mean, a lot of people, including me, like to explore very interactively and notebooks and often go back up and rerun a cell and change things and see what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2583" target="_blank">00:43:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, it's a very good idea from time to time to hit 00 and then rerun all the cells, or at least to head over to your terminal and run nb dev test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and another thing is like you know like when you get a failed test in your terminal, you do what I do. I'm just sharing my workflow is I come back and I do restart run all I get the error in the notebook and then I hit the interactive debugger, like the percent percent debug and I kind of go from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, what's going on. Yeah, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to explain if we put a bug in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You get an error. You can hit percent debug, and it will drop you into an interactive debugger, which is called PDB it comes with Python and you can do things like find out the value of any variable like suit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can find out the stack traces where we are. You can get a listing of source code and so forth. And you can, yeah, basically write any Python expression you like, figure out how to fix the bug.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2652" target="_blank">00:44:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And away you go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2654" target="_blank">00:44:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's do a deck of cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll export this to something called deck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So generally speaking, you know in your second notebook it's pretty likely you're going to want to import this stuff from your previous notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the moment I won't be able to do that. Actually yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's try it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe because you did an editable install of cards and they got it wrong. Yeah, the card yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't remember doing that. I guess I must have. So the reason that works I guess maybe I did that without even thinking about if you type PIP install minus a dot in your get repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically it's going to install the thing you're currently working on as a library, and it's going to be pointing at your actual source code so every time you update it, it'll be there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how come I can import it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so, and now you might want to put the import in a separate cell and export it, perhaps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly. So, let's do that, because that's actually going to be part of the library is that we probably going to want to use these cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that should be part of the exported.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually we should probably look at that so let's take a look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oops, I just managed to break everything today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2736" target="_blank">00:45:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just make sure this is actually going to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. So because I've got the quarter server nb dev server running in the background it's constantly trying to compile my code so I had it in a non compiling stages before, just by complaint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I take a look at the nb dev cards card file you can see this is the source that's created for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, if we now like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a full deck of cards is going to contain every for every suit and for each suit for every card is going to contain a cut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's not very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2782" target="_blank">00:46:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can do the same trick we've seen before, which is to just join the cards together when we're stringifying it and set the representation to be the same as the string area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now if we might just stop running our server for a bit bit annoying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we could now export and we can see you've never decked up by and you know you can treat this just like you would any normal source code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, I use VIM so if I go to card and I get control right square bracket and VIM jumps me straight to the definition of card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2823" target="_blank">00:47:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like you can do what you know I can jump back so you can still like you know if you use vs code you can still use it just like the normal way that you would look through source code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or of course we can use the trick we've seen before for example double question mark to get that working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2846" target="_blank">00:47:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah, because it's not exported your fast core utils test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2851" target="_blank">00:47:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah, that was a mistake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that needs to be exported, because that's part of what we actually need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You should put all your imports in the separate cell by itself. Maybe it's a good time to mention that oh and then just a moment so that we need to export the hat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2869" target="_blank">00:47:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then we could check that that's working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's looking hopeful.

Alright, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2888" target="_blank">00:48:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Hamilton started talking about a wonderful wrinkle you have to be aware of when creating your code in nv dev, which is that there's one golden rule, you have to keep in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that golden rule is that you, your cells should either contain imports or non imports, but not a mixture of the two. So you'll see this doesn't contain any imports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This doesn't contain anything but imports. And the reason for that is that when it builds your docs, it has to be able to go through and run every one of your cells containing imports, in order that it can then run all of your show doc cells correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not going to run any other cells. So just remember don't have a cell that contains both a import command, and also something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2943" target="_blank">00:49:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the only slightly weird rule, you have to remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2949" target="_blank">00:49:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think something else that I'd like to add to our deck is just to know how big it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2955" target="_blank">00:49:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So done the land gives you that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's first create a deck call it deck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I notice a difference in case here this is my object and this is my class and this is my instantiated object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that's useful is to know if a card is in the deck.

And so this is where I put a test, rather than just displaying it because that way we're both showing the user what we're expecting and we're also ensuring that that continues to be the case in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just as a reminder for people not familiar, the test EQ is a wrapper around assert adjust will give you a nicer error message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, pretty much so that they're equal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if they're not, it'll let you know what they actually were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So as you can see like most of the fast AI library code tends to be just a couple of lines of this line, this is one line of code is functions defined with two lines of code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Normally you can like, yeah, we've, I mean there's good documentation for all this stuff of course if you go to the fast core docs, you can go to test and see examples of all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but often you can just quickly look at the source code if you want to see exactly what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The ace clubs.

So the CI sensor continuous integrations that means our tests are passed, and the deployment was completed so you can actually click on these things to see them, or the steps that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3592" target="_blank">00:59:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they run.

And so you can see it's basically building it there looks like it's finished building it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, it's finished. And you can see it tells us here where it's been built to. So what I like to do is I tend to copy that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3618" target="_blank">01:00:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I go into my settings and paste it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's our website. Awesome. Now links are working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that's looking good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Shall we put this on pai pai Hamill. Yeah, you know and that's the CI, I mean, I just want to point out like most projects at this point, you would only just have code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3646" target="_blank">01:00:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, at this point, we have CI, we have a documentation site, and this is the point where, you know, when I'm personally coding and I'm kind of down at this is exciting because I just like my colleague, you know I just say hey like I created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a tool you wanted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then here's the website. They're like, you have a website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, check it out. You can install it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and then they're like wow it's, and then also you can just pip install it and also you have CI like how did you do all this, such a short amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3682" target="_blank">01:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3686" target="_blank">01:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not working. Oh, you know the other thing we should have done is run nb dev docs. And the reason for that is that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3698" target="_blank">01:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of does a trial run of the same thing that that it's going to have that GitHub actions is going to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3707" target="_blank">01:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what it also does is it updates our read me to contain the same contents as the homepage does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Keep getting I haven't got this earliest installed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we now look, the other thing which we've got is a beautiful read me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that comes from our index to my plan B and it's going to be the same as the homepage it won't be as beautiful as a homepage because it's using more limited markdown but the basic you know the basics are there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so we can see that there's an nb dev pipeline to upload to pipeline, and there's another one for Conda doing Conda, or just nb dev release to do both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to do pipeline for now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3753" target="_blank">01:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright, so let's run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3755" target="_blank">01:02:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it uploads to pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And just at the end it's also automatically bump the version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see here it's gone to version two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I tend to like just go get commit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm bump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it says I can view it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There it is. And you can see it's even what the project description project homepage has all been done automatically, which I think is all the metadata.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3788" target="_blank">01:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like a very professional and polished library for something that we spent under two hours on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and furthermore, like, it's, you know, it's not just for a little quick to our things like this you know I've.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3803" target="_blank">01:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well you and I have both written libraries that have taken years with thousands of lines of code and dozens of modules and 10s or hundreds of thousands of users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3812" target="_blank">01:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no, it's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine what it's like to make a PR into one of these projects so let's just say I don't have any idea how deck works at all. I'm like what is this deck thing, never seen it, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And without knowing anything about the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just go to that notebook and there's all there's already the entry point for me. There's the code and then there's sample is on how to run it with documentation right there so there's no confusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3840" target="_blank">01:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I noticed that we got a lot of pull requests just high quality ones making the documentation better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Making the test better, because people read it they get confused and they just resolve their confusion they just say I'm just going to edit this real quick and submit a PR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean let's let's have a look at an example so last year as an example of a package which uses MB dev.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3864" target="_blank">01:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's got over 20,000 stars on GitHub over 7000 folks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's an example of an open PR. And one thing that we'd use which is fine is there's a thing called review and be actually means I can click a button here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And because it's yeah because it's all in notebooks, you know, I can immediately see the documentation that I've added, and I can make comments on the documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you know I can see the source code that's been changed I can see if they've added or removed any tests. I can see if any of the output graphs or whatever have changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3901" target="_blank">01:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, it's, it's, it's nice, both for me as the person reviewing that PR, and also as you say for the person making that PR that we're very much all on the same page about what's about what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3916" target="_blank">01:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah I find we didn't get pretty, pretty high quality pull requests to our projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is only kind of the tip of the iceberg, like there's a lot of exciting things so you can use the same tools that we've shown today to just make a website, let's say you don't necessarily write code maybe you want to just write a blog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3938" target="_blank">01:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll have a tutorial or video, like at some time in the near future that shows Okay, how do you do write a blog. And then also, you can just have a website to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3948" target="_blank">01:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you just want to make a tutorial on, let's say how to use fast.ai or how to use your favorite library you can use same set of tools to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's all kinds of advanced stuff that you can do to like Corto is very powerful you can make books from it slides, all kinds of different formats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's the same, you know, for making any kind of technical content as well so yeah it's it's really exciting. Yeah, and it's a whole different philosophy of how to write software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3977" target="_blank">01:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, I think it's you and I've both got the experience now that it's made us more productive and we're having more fun, so it's good to be doing this tutorial to think about people watching it that are going to join this journey as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=3990" target="_blank">01:06:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, thanks everybody for watching and Hamill. Thanks so much for joining in the tutorial late at night before you're doing a keynote tomorrow I really appreciate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FdzLSt4aA&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's good.
