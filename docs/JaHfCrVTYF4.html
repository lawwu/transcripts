for this which is just taking a look at the React agents which obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the earlier not earlier it's probably I would say like the foundational structure for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what agents look like today what when I say agents I mean LM based agents and I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">well that is just the most popular type of agent okay React but now it's more like tools or tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">agents but they're very similar anyway I'll talk a little bit about them so first thing I do want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe cover very quickly is the React agent because that's what we're most familiar with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'll come down to here so as a reminder okay React is basically this here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so we have some input okay there's some text and rather than just asking our LM to answer directly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we allow our LM to go through multiple reasoning steps and part of those reasoning steps is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">fact that the agent can also call tools so it can get some external information or do something else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's what I'm visualizing here right so we have our question this is from the React paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which I have linked to but the example is okay aside from the Apple remote what other device can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">control the program Apple remote was originally designed to interact with probably to be honest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">most LM's can answer this directly now I think particularly given that this example is from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the React paper which is like two years ago but anyway it's off topic we're just giving an example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">here right so in this example what we're doing is okay we have these tools that the LM can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we provide them and we're also prompting the agent the LM sorry to say okay go through these multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">steps of reasoning and action so that is where the React comes from so it's RE and act from action</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and it goes through these steps so it's like okay I have access to the search tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">um and like an answer tool at the bottom here which not really a tool but it kind of is at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">same time so it goes through has this prompt and it knows I have to structure things in this React</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">methodology so that's what it does it says okay it starts it says okay I need to search Apple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">remote and find a program is useful and then it provides it structures an action based on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so it knows it has a search tool and it knows that the input to the search tool is a query which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a string okay so we have the Apple remote that function runs using some logic that we've developed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and the observation from that is this the Apple remote is designed to control the front row media</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">center okay so what's the question we have aside from the Apple remote what other device can control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the program Apple remote was originally designed to interact with so now we know what that original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">uh program was right which is front row and we have that information the LM now knows that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">information so it goes on to a next step and it says okay what do I need to do now I know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple remote controls the front row program but what other device controls the front row program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so it says okay based on this um my next reasoning step is I need to search front row and find other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">devices that control it so then it does this search for front row it could also probably do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something if we're thinking in rag terms here we could be like device to control front row and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">probably a more today LM would do that but that's fine this is just an example so it goes back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the search tool again and it says query front row and this isn't like I've shortened this uh for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sake of brevity I think in the actual example it returned or at least from the paper the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">example returns a lot more information uh but this is the part of it that is important all right so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">front row is controlled by an Apple remote or keyboard function keys okay so now we know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that gets fed back into the LM so the LM you know now knows you know everything that we've covered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here knows the original query and I was like okay well I have all the information that I need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">answer the original query which is side to a map or remote what other device can control front row</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so the next step is the LM is like oh okay I have everything I can now provide the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of keyboard function keys to the user okay and so it doesn't use a search tool and now it instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">uses the answer tool which has this query this sorry parameter out and the the answer or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">output for that is keyboard function keys which then gets provided back to the user okay so this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is the react agent and this sort of structure of like reasoning building a like a query for a tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">getting a response and then potentially going through another iteration of reasoning and action</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and another and

target="_blank">00:07:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">accepted definition of what an agent is that's what most people are using at the moment and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">think that is great but I think it's very limiting because I I just wouldn't in production I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">never just put something like this whether it's react or openai tools or whatever else I wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just put that in my opinion an agent is much broader than just what this is and also in general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know broader literature an agent is not just this either so I went back and I just went through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a few papers to try and figure out okay what what is a actual good definition of an agent that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of makes sense in the way that I also understand agents the way that I've been building like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic more workflows to be honest right but to me workflow or agent it's kind of the same thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's agentic workflow

this major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">premise then you have a

things that we try and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">solve with rag

target="_blank">00:19:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of things um which is kind of interesting i think but anyway so my my definition of agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of goes along those lines it's neural neural plus symbolic and the reason i like it is one we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">have that sort of um that that definition is anchored in you know the ai for the past almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">100 years maybe 80 years roughly um which is great i think it's good that we have some like really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">very solid foundations behind that definition you're a symbolic and two one of the reasons i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like it is because when i'm building these systems okay lms are great but i i don't just use lms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">um a lot of time there is very good reason to bring in other neural network based models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so by broadening that neural definition to neural network um you you you don't restrict yourself to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just saying lm right because okay use lms like amazing and of course i use them a lot but not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just lms right so the idea behind um if i go to semantic router i don't know if you've used it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:21:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">example so semantic router uses embedding models which are on neural network base and what they do</span></div><div class="c"><span

it okay so this is the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">example so we have an embedding model this thing in the middle here and what we do is we provide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1326"

target="_blank">00:22:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">then we have the ask lm route and this is a better example so slm route all right so i'm saying okay</span></div><div class="c"><span

anything caught in that area</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there and that is probably the user asking for us to do a search essentially so then what we can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what what as many things we can do but one thing we can just do is say okay that that's the user's</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:23:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the right pipeline directly and it's way faster than going through an lm and i would say probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">much more controllable however lms provide a lot of flexibility so that's not what i would usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">do instead what i usually do is there's there's still an lm right so let's say over here right i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have an lm and what i do is okay we have our query that we got from the from the user what i'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is i'm just going to i'm going to modify a little bit all right so i'm going to come over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">here and and

target="_blank">00:24:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility of use down to the lm which i i like so i say okay original query right from the user</span></div><div class="c"><span

something extra so i say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like system

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right so i modified the query that gets sent to the lm and in the lm you're basically a kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">heavily suggesting

target="_blank">00:24:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">system you know the the agent is not just the lm it's it's also the embedding here right and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if you're not even you know not even including an lm here right there's like to me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this system without an lm is pretty agentic to me right that seems to me to be an agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then even more so when you add the lm and decision making in there so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah i i prefer to think of agents as this type of system right or or not just this type of system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but at least more flexibly because i think that if you think of agents just as an lm that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1538"

and even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if you take the example of okay let's say we have multiple like tool sets or we have okay once we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">decided on one tool okay let's start here right let's say we make a decision our lm is making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this decision that's fine no problem right but it goes down these two different paths</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all right so it says tool a or tool b and let's say if we have used tool a for you know whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that is maybe it's reading about the news whereas tool b is always someone's asking a math question</span></div><div class="c"><span

searching for some explanation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from like a like a math website right where's this to go into a news website right two different use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">cases and and what you might find that with these two different use cases is that the follow-on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tools if any right maybe there aren't any who knows right but maybe there are and the follow-on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">tools for these would be different right what i mean you've already identified that the intent is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">very in you know is two very different things so why would the follow-on tools be similar there's</span></div><div class="c"><span

still have an lm in the middle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHfCrVTYF4&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe
