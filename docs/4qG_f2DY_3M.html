happening in AI, you know, these days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of questions about comparisons because, remember, we were there during the 99-2000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of boom and bust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of my classmates are wondering whether or not AI is kind of like that again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was going back and pulling together these slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have to say, a few things just shocked me, frankly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I forgot how much has changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">One was I was doing, I was looking, I'm doing some analysis on Amazon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I was day trading Amazon out of the back of the classroom back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And you were out here working on the IPO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know you were paying attention to what the share price was in 98, 99, and 2000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And a couple of interesting points, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon, if you recall, Bill, and I know you do, it peaked at $243 a share in 1998.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the start of 2000, it's at $150 a share, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And Henry Blodgett famously makes the call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">He calls $400 a share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And he literally kind of top ticks it from the year 2000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing plummets and goes down to about $26 a share, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he gets ridiculed and all this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But I wanted to...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it went public at $17 and broke issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, wow, wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So it traded under issue for about two months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm sure you didn't get any calls from the company about what the F was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's the crazy thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, he gets ridiculed for making that call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted to know, and I went and asked our chat GPT friend to help me with some split-adjusted math on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So split-adjusted from the high in 2000, which was this $150, that's equivalent to about $0.47 split-adjusted today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's up about $440x from where it was in 2000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And on a split-adjusted basis from the low in 2000, it's up about $1,800x, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, those are shocking numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, so that was one of the things that dawned on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I said, well, what's happened to the NASDAQ since we graduated?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, from the peak in 2000, the NASDAQ is still up 5x.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And from the trough in 2000, it's up 10x.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I said, you know, what's the punchline?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The punchline is, you know, we were a bunch of dreamy-eyed, big, you know, big thinkers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We thought we knew everything about the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We knew it was going to change the world forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out we overestimated what it was going to do in the short term, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the next two to three years, adoption was slower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We had the terrorist attacks in 2001.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We had an economic recession.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So things definitely grew slower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But the biggest problem was there just weren't that many people connected to a high-speed internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So all the things we dreamed of occurring were just inefficient to happen at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's probably even more surprising, Bill, is how dramatically we underestimated the long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the next 20 to 25 years, it blew away all of our estimates and forecasts in terms of how big these companies would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we sit here at, you know, kind of the dawn of the age of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think people are asking a lot of these same questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, that was probably the biggest punchline on my 25-year reflection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, if they listen to the podcast, they're going to miss your talk, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe, you know, talking about this pace of AI, you and I were sending some things back and forth, just about some strategic shifts going on in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Talk us through that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, obviously, I mean, the pace continues like crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time, you know, between just the podcast episodes we do, which are about two to three weeks, there's new news always and constantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's hard to keep up with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do try and pay attention to the stuff that spikes in my brain as being strategic and something you should really pay attention to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing that I've seen in the past week, so this is very recent, is what I might call data walls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so everyone's recognizing the value of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody wants to have AI work against their data, against, you know, and everybody wants to wow the consumer or the customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all of a sudden, though, we're seeing, you know, things pop up where people are trying to wall off data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, one example would be Reddit just sued Anthropic this morning despite having a deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'd be interesting to unpack what's in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a tiff between Windsurf and Anthropic, where Anthropic cut off, cut them off to all their models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Windsurf was bought by OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not that surprising, but just seeing these walls pop up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a more interesting one in the enterprise case is Salesforce changed their terms of service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And in a way that includes not only the CRM data, but Slack data, which, you know, is a company they bought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're putting an MCP connector on top of it, which allows AI to query it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're saying that you can't train on the data that's in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Hold on a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So Altimeter Slack data, I can't train on my own data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what the change in the terms of service say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You can query the MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think it's, you know, I think maybe we'll start to talk about enterprise applications as either being open data or closed data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And people are going to need to declare that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But my guess is that if you're a competitor to Salesforce, you're immediately going to declare yourself open data and try and steal as many customers as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't fathom in my own brain how upset I would be if I were paying seven, eight figure license to Salesforce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And they told me I couldn't train on my own data, which is basically everything about my customers and everything that I would want to analyze.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm sure they're going to train on it and give you their AI agentic view of it, which is why they're doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But battle lines are being drawn, you know, going back to the old song.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and one of the things you didn't mention, Bill, I just saw Kevin Weil, our friend, tweeted from OpenAI that deep research is now searching across GitHub, Google Docs, Gmail, Outlook, HubSpot, Dropbox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I think a lot of that's using MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I do agree with you that this all seems to be happening faster rather than slower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it reminds me, you and I back in the day sitting in a Zillow board meeting and talking about people building dependencies on Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And you were very much aligned with you can't build a brand in the underbelly of Google because over time they will have to take that territory back, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember TripAdvisor peaked at $20 billion in value building a search engine, a recommendation engine in the underbelly of Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when Google decided it was time to do recommendations on its own, TripAdvisor's value went from $20 billion to $1 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, but that happened over a period of many, many years, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I see happening here is kind of in part because AI is going so much faster than the Internet did, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw some analysis from my team this week, we'll post, that OpenAI reached, you know, 400 billion annual searches, eight years faster than Google, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're doing over a billion searches a day now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of this is happening in hyper speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the strategic plays by all of these companies to vertically integrate, to shut down, you know, access to data because they all know that they need to monetize by kind of offering that full stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, that to me is something for these companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look at Windsurf, they're going to have to build their own models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look at Cursor, they're building their own models, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The dependencies on, you know, kind of all of these different open models, I think, you know, is changing very rapidly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, and I'm sure Anthropic, you know, woke up on the Windsurf announcement and said, oh, wait, you know, OpenAI is going into verticals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, and we're good at coding, so how do we think about this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, I mean, it's a reordering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people really need to pay attention to this data thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at where OpenAI wants to go on the consumer side, you know, access to your contacts, your calendar, your mail, like all that's going to matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're going to want your personal assistant to be able to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And whoever owns those systems, whether or not they try to block access to it or not, will be interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Google has an advantage in that they own, you know, they own their own phone platform and they own their own Gmail platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they own their own alternative to the office stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, they should be able to make that a competitive advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, whether or not they'll be willing to put up a wall and say, OpenAI can't scrub this, it'll all be very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something that's super important to watch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean,

<span class="t">You know, I think you and I both agree that MCP is a good development in allowing more open access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">At the end of the day, it should be my data.</span></div><div class="c"><span

not going to be able to use my AI of choice, right, accessing this information to make my life better to answer questions, that, you know, that will lead to a lot of disruption.</span></div><div

they're going to access all those things using MCP on my behalf, which I'm excited about, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I am using all of those Google services, but I do like the idea of using ChatGPT that has a lot of buildup memory about me to access those services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think you and I will certainly be loud and proud on the side of keeping this all open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But we definitely see some early warning signs here of people closing down the ecosystem, you know, in order to try to protect some of those advantages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Another topic, Bill, you

class="t">And one of the interesting parts of our dialogue, from my perspective over the course of the last few months, is just how well China is doing in robots, in autos, in batteries, in precision manufacturing, deep seek coming out of nowhere, Huawei.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.260</a></span> |

like how they've in fact seeded these industries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.240</a></span> | <span

everybody can see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But yes, I think it's imperative that we understand exactly why China is so competitive in so many industries and what led them to be successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I uncovered, and I had heard this from a few other people in the past, but what I really uncovered the detail on is that in these industries where they want to succeed, they actually make sure that there are 500 competitors or 1,000 competitors.</span></div><div

we have a perception that communist or authoritarian governments have a single state-sponsored company that's not very competitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the fittest, you know, create the five companies that survive all of that as winners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And we all know, because we believe in capitalism, that that kind of system will lead to the very best shining at the end of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's interesting, Bill, because, you know, you and I grew up kind of with this model in, you know, Soviet Russia where they picked a state actor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of the reason we won the Cold War is they bankrupted themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">All those state actors were terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They were inefficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They were full of grift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They couldn't compete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Their products weren't any good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But we see the exact opposite out of China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We see products that are globally competitive, you know, and many that are in these different industries better than the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So there has to be something systematic and structurally different that they're doing, even though we refer to them as both of them as communist systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I've studied these types of systems my whole life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I've mentioned before that I'm on the board of the Sanify Institute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And this kind of Darwinian competition is exactly the kind of thing that I would, if you told me they were doing this before they did it, I'd say, well, that might actually work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's, this is sensible to me that this works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing that came out of it, in addition to just helping to identify winners, you know, there's a couple of other benefits you get from this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">One, you're exposed to way more optionality because 500 startups will try a bunch of different approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And one, one thing I've uncovered in the past few weeks is Chinese LIDAR is solid state and designed very differently than the LIDAR that Waymo is using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's actually in China right now is, I think, being priced at like $130 a car, this solid state MEMS LIDAR, whereas the Waymo LIDAR is like $5,000 a car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you end up in completely different places because of this type of competition and you have this many people trying different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the other big thing that happens is your supply chain develops in a lot more robust way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if I'm a supplier, you know, to, you know, a part that's important to a solar panel or to an EV, I now have, you know, 50 or 100 competitors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So you end up, and that births more and more competitors in, in for that part as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you end up with a much more robust supply chain, more players at each, each step along the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, you know, I think the data suggests in this, this piece of research would suggest that's why they've been so successful in EVs where there were over 500 EV startups, 500 in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What has there been four legitimate ones?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">A handful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's my question, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In Silicon Valley, we have this dynamic ecosystem of risk capital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We're probably, I don't know, fourth, fifth generation of risk capital and risk takers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They find each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not a lot of government interaction or coordination with regard to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it just kind of happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What are we saying?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, like, how is, is this ecosystem developed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">There's definitely venture capital in China, but it seems to me as a fraction of the venture capital that, that exists in the, in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or certainly the tightness of the ecosystem over the course of the last four or five years has been reduced dramatically because a lot of the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">players, right, backed off from China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So is it the different states and provinces that are seeding or subsidizing to get these 500 startups rolling?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, how are they getting going?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so the government involvement, you know, is at a provincial level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's part of why there's such a high number, like a high number of startups in the area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's interesting if you take this as a conclusion, oh, this, this work, this was very successful for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you turn and say, what should, you know, the West do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's hard because, you know, when, when our governments tried to get involved in startups, it's never been about helping to ensure there were a thousand of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's usually, you know, you create some program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The one that's stuck in my brain was solar because I actually had a company in the space, you know, where there were probably 10, you know, solar startups that had raised over $500 million.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then three of them were able to, you know, court the players in DC long enough to, to get money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Solyndra being the, the one that people remember the most because they eventually went bankrupt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But, but that doesn't feel like this thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That, that feels more like a regulatory capture and who can win, you know, at the highest level this, and, and, and it's more at the end of the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">This is at the beginning of the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know, I don't know if there's a U.S. equivalent of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll need to think about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my first step was just to, to take a fresh look at why they've been successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I saw that the approach was so, you know, novel from what I had imagined it was, it was very eye-opening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, one of the things you pointed out to me was that they deprioritize market caps, or I might even say over the last five years that they've kind of attacked the largest market cap companies in favor, perhaps, of diversifying competition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, it seems like the one thing I think we can definitively say there's a hell of a lot more national coordination about what industries are important, like their industrial policy identifies an industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Then what it seems like they do from the, you know, kind of central governing authority is they encourage all of the, the provinces to seed these companies within, you know, their, their different areas, allow that competition to occur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess the question is, you know, when you look at the U.S. where, you know, it's much more just unfettered competition, is this just like, is the point here, just be aware of this, or are you suggesting that there are things that the U.S. needs to do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it seems in some ways, like the coordinated industrial policy that's now coming out of Washington, the stuff that the president is talking about, where we have to re-onshore critical national industries, precision manufacturing, some medical supplies, some chips, some, you know, aluminum and steel, that would seem to me to be fairly aligned with the industrial policy that you're discussing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there's, there's, there's, there's so much, like you ask, you just ask a question that might take four hours to answer, but let me, let me just try and be as terse as possible in responding to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had chat CBD do two more pieces of research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one I, this, or this would be part two, part two is worth mentioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think most people believe that and talk about China subsidization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So once winners are identified, there are situations where the government has helped subsidize BYD was in a situation where I think they were given $2 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So that second part walks through cases of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to shy away from that part because that is the criticism that a lot of people bring to the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this will give a dump of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But the third thing, which you hinted at, which, which I think is very important to think about, and before I get to any type of response, I want to make sure I fully understand what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And there does seem to be, and I, and I, and part three of this research walks through this, a deprioritization of market cap of successful companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And this, this is something that I think should be important for policymakers to understand, but also investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're buying stocks of Chinese companies, you know, hoping that they will, you know, like, like the mag seven turn into these $3 trillion entities, the Chinese government may not consider that part of the objective function of what a win is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And we, in the past three weeks, we saw BYD take prices down 30% that may have had encouragement from the government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1298"

and all those topics that you just mentioned, they're all covered in these three pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1395"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think in the U S we have a mindset that, oh, having, you know, $3 trillion winners is, is a, is a positive sign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's important to understand that that may not be the attitude over there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can, that can lead to different decision-making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You're, you're making me think about some of, uh, the relative valuation comparisons between Chinese internet companies and U S companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If you really think that, um, there's going to be an obstacle to allowing them to grow bigger, that's, uh, that's something U S investors have to take into account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think the number one thing for me, Bill, the, the, the, so what on all of this is that we're, we're in this competition with China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we would be very naive to think that they're going to do anything, but be extraordinarily competitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You and I have argued they're on the frontier of AI already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, they're gaining ground quickly on chips, uh, and right on our heels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, uh, I, I appreciated unpacking a little bit, the why, like, why have they, they've been so successful there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that, that was my takeaway, Bill, are there any other takeaways, uh, from the research that you have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there, there are two, um, one, you know, I think a lot of people kind of quip quickly that, oh, China is successful because of IP theft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, you know, I think if you, if you narrow it down to one, you know, derogatory action or comment, you're ignoring this system that, and that's why I would encourage people to read that part one, at least, and just see the breadth of the work that, that went into place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that you could make a bad policy decision because you think, oh, well, if we just protect IP, then this won't keep happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But there, there's more happening than that, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that'd be part one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then second, on the AI front, um, one thing we talked about last time is, you know, all of a sudden, you open your eyes, and there's four deep-pocketed open-source players in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think about, you know, promoting competitiveness as part of what's going to lead to global success, I wouldn't be shocked to learn or find out that the government favored, you know, an approach like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And having four open-source competitors for all the reasons that the systems they put in place for EVs and solar panels, to me, those are very similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it just makes it cheaper and easier for the ecosystems to benefit from one another, even though the economics and the margins on those products may be lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And one other thing that I should have mentioned that might be an objective function of the CCP is just the affordability to their, to their entire citizenry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, BYD selling a car for 10 grand is better for the consumer in China, as might be, you know, for open-source AI models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, staying on the theme of China, Bill, you and I have talked a ton over the past two years about the need to stop illegal immigration, but to dramatically ramp up recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest to the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.480</a></span> | <span

yeah, one interesting takeaway from what we just talked about is maybe the Chinese government isn't as interested in entrepreneurs being as successful economically, you know, from an equity

target="_blank">00:31:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We've stayed ahead in all of these critical national security areas precisely because we've been so inviting to people around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were making the

occurred in the administrations, in some respects, I could not have been more thrilled by the president's promise on the all-in pod.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1944" target="_blank">00:32:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought that was a big turning point, I think, for folks in Silicon

like a 180 on this, I certainly hope that it was misinterpreted, that it's very narrow, that we are going to project an inviting and welcoming brand America.</span></div><div class="c"><span

world's best researchers here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you said, I saw a study that suggested that 40 to 50 percent of the AI researchers in the United States, our best researchers, are Chinese.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're going to go after Chinese students studying AI at Stanford, by definition, the slippery slope is not that far to say, I got to go after these researchers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a lot more risks to our national security, theoretically, than a student studying at Stanford.</span></div><div class="c"><span

if we do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2008" target="_blank">00:33:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, when I saw your tweet about this, the best way to stay ahead of China is to poach their talent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2014"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That if you were an AI researcher from China in the United States, we had to give your family an AI visa to come over here so that you don't have so much pressure on you to go back to China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Totally agree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to find out where we need to bottom this out.</span></div><div

on recruiting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to find, you know, just merely trying to understand China, why it's successful, and all those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2045"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I worry more in general that the China hawk mindset leads you to policy that's really bad, you know, especially people that jump to that place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2066"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just think that, you know, policy is one of those things where you can have an intent and you can implement a policy and you can get the exact opposite outcome, which was one of the things I talked about back in my speech at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the export controls on China probably is what caused Huawei to catch up so

target="_blank">00:35:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, other people have said this, so I don't want to belabor it too much, but, you know, the entire Manhattan Project was heavily impacted by immigrants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, many of

been stuck, I think, at two to 250,000 a year for like 20 years is insanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2177"

specifically this now deprecated Blackwell 30 chip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me explain why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me maybe make, you know, four or five points as to why I think this would be a great trade for the U.S. at this point in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, this, you know, this B30 is this deprecated chip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the concerns we had about the H20 was that there was too much high bandwidth memory on it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And that, if you cluster enough of them together, could be used for training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So what they did on the B30 is they took, it took HBM off it altogether.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it also doesn't use this COOS from TSMC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it gives them a chip that's competitive in the market, but it actually deprecates it from a training perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It still provides a big gap to where the U.S. frontier chips are, the Blackwell 200 and 300, but it is competitive in the Chinese market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what does that do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about this the last few weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That keeps, you know, half of the world's researchers and the developers in the AI ecosystem are in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It keeps them in that CUDA ecosystem, allows NVIDIA to compete, and I think slows down their ability to run the table around the rest of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I think when we ban chips to China, it's going to accelerate Huawei, like we just talked about, unintended consequences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to bring everybody into their developer ecosystem, and it's going to reduce the amount of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's a bad thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, selling them these chips, right, which I don't think materially advances their cause on AI, generates billions and billions of dollars of taxes to the U.S. government, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It reduces our trade deficit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, if we're selling them $40 billion worth of chips and all of a sudden we take it to zero, we've just increased our trade deficit by $40 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, it produces billions in revenue or in profits to NVIDIA, which they can then plow back in to making sure that NVIDIA stays at the front of the AI race, which is a proxy for the U.S. staying in front in AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's point two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">On point three, it gets us, right, if we do this trade, and I don't know that China would do this trade, but if we did this trade, then it would get us access to those rare earths right now, which is absolutely critical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it buys us time to stand up our own rare earth supply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no doubt what this moment has revealed to both China and to the United States is that we have to get back to our critical industries, precision manufacturing, rare earths, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's going to take years to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And China, I'm sure, is saying to themselves, we've got to wean our dependency off of NVIDIA, but it also takes them years to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it allows us to continue to build that out without the disruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2459" target="_blank">00:40:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If we don't do this, then we're going to have a massively disrupted economy over the next six quarters, slowing down economic growth and causing problems and critical shortages in parts to the military, in parts to our U.S. auto industry, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say the next point, I'll call this a final one, and then I want to get your reaction, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If we keep the chip ban in place, here's my biggest concern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it dramatically increases the chances that China is forced to move on Taiwan, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We're out there telling everybody in the world that AI is totally existential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2496" target="_blank">00:41:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We have lots of our leaders who are saying AGI is going to be eclipsed within the next two to three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2503" target="_blank">00:41:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But yet we're telling one of the largest economic powers on the planet, but we're going to prevent you from having it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a way they can say, well, if that is so existential as a risk to our country, we just have to go take Taiwan, which I don't think I think would be horrible for the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, I think it would be terrible for China as well, but it would be a hugely risky event in the world, particularly because the U.S. needs another three to four years to diversify our supply chain away from China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So three reactions to this first, and they're all in agreement, but yeah, it'd be tough to balance trade if we don't let them have the stuff we're really good at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the stuff you trade, I mean, this is compared, this is like economics 101, like the country, you know, you sell the stuff you're best at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you take that off the table, they're not going to buy our crap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like, there's no way to get to a trade balance if you're taking our best stuff off the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I totally agree on Taiwan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I've made this point for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Jeffrey Sachs makes the same point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to be careful that the actions you're taking aren't the exact ones that encourage that to happen the most quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then thirdly, you know, part of why we're in this battle over these rare earth components is that we did these export controls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't just about the NVIDIA chips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think recently we are trying to tell the world they can't buy the Huawei chips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2597" target="_blank">00:43:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is outside of America trying to enforce an export ban on China's products selling into Europe, selling into South America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that is, you know, something that is beyond the scope of what our government should be capable of doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've talked about this in the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I expect, you know, ASML to just ignore us telling them they can't or can't do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I worry, and I've mentioned this before, but I worry that rather than build a wall around China, we're going to build a wall around America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2633" target="_blank">00:43:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, it's well said, and listen, I think huge credit goes to David Sachs and Howard Lutnik so far for repealing the Biden diffusion rule by reopening up the global markets, making sure America's running as fast as we can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The American AI stack can win around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2652" target="_blank">00:44:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a closer call for them on U.S. chips to China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.180</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:44:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it would be a great win-win trade for both countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We need those rare earths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, I'm not saying that this is a permanent state of nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about this, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, we have about 0% of leading-edge chips fabbed outside of Taiwan, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost nothing in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And by 2020 or by 2030, so four or five years from now, people think that we'll have upwards of 15% to 20% leading-edge capacity in the United States, which is a huge step forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw a presentation this week involving the United Arab Emirates, where if they were to build an advanced fab with TSMC and give the U.S. some sovereign influence over this fab, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it was a joint deal, that we could increase the market share of the United States' advanced nodes to almost 40% or 50% in four years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be an extraordinary rebalancing of the global supply chain when it comes to advanced chips.</span></div><div class="c"><span

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it would seem to me that now would be the time that you would find this reasonable middle ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">We would run like hell to build out capability in Arizona and in other countries like the UAE that are friendly to us, where we're building out this leading-edge capability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It would seem to me a much smarter policy than pursuing the one that we're on now, where we have global embargoes, the Chinese on rare earths and us on chips.</span></div><div class="c"><span

cautious that the market has rebounded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yet, many of the biggest issues that I think people care about, whether or not we can get some agreement with China, what's going to happen with the tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's new information on that, judges blocking and not blocking the tariff talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the debt issue, which now there's a whole bunch of noise being stirred up by Elon now saying he doesn't support the big, beautiful bills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So there seems to me to be as much uncertainty as there's ever been this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm very curious on your take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the market's clearly not agreeing with you at the moment, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we've had this incredible bounce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The Nasdaq's up 20% from its intraday lows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's just above flat for the year, maybe up 1%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The S&P also has had a huge bounce, now up like 2% for the year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, I think it was on May 2nd or early in May where we talked about us changing the flight path</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">because I saw this approach to getting to the other side of tariffs, the Besant consensus winning, signing the reconciliation bill that would extend the tax cuts and have new tax stimulus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as I sit here today, like the bounce makes a lot of sense to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But where we go from here matters a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what are the key things that I'm looking at?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first on tariffs, China is the big enchilada.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The president's talking with President Xi on Friday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to believe that the Besant consensus or accord that was negotiated in Geneva, that we are going to get to a status where global tariffs are going to land in that territory, you know, on a blended basis around the world of, you know, 10, 15%, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we talked about are they going to be trillions or are they going to be hundreds of billions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's got to land in that lower quadrant or I think the market moves lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's still where we're headed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2893" target="_blank">00:48:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But there definitely, the topic we just talked about, there's some binary outcomes, I think, as it relates to us in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like Europe is making good progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now on the reconciliation bill, it looked like that was making incredible progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I still think it will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Listen, I think that Elon has appropriately, you know, pointed out that the challenge is with the debt, but I would really encourage people to look at this Ray Dalio piece and also what Besant has now been saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">They call it 3-3-3, but it's how to get us to 3% GDP growth, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2927" target="_blank">00:48:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And how to get us to a debt to GDP ratio of 3%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't just cut $2 trillion in a single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be an 800 basis point headwind to GDP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It would throw us into a recession, if not depression-like state, because you have so – remember, government spending is a component of GDP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's about what is the flight path?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would like to see Besant lay out this four-, five-, six-year plan to this 3% debt-to-GDP ratio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to happen in the reconciliation bill because, again, as many people have discussed, the reconciliation bill does not touch discretionary spending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That will come by way of the rescission act that was just sent to Congress, and the Speaker of the House has said that he's going to vote on, and I expect that they will pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2977" target="_blank">00:49:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's – you know, I think it's a confusing set of issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2981" target="_blank">00:49:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But to be clear, I think that we need to see the reconciliation bill passed because that's what extends the tax cuts, which I think are critical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the absence of that, you get a $4 trillion tax increase, and markets go a lot lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In addition to that, the no tax on tips, the no tax on overtime, the ability to have a deduction against your Social Security taxes, that's probably $300 or $400 billion of new stimulus to the economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's going to give you the growth, Bill, to get you back to 3%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think if you're a market participant, I believe that we're going to land the plane on both of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you believe that we're going to land the plane, then I see accelerating economic growth in the back half of the year and into next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is – you know, be optimistic, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But the proof is in the pudding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got to see those things land there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they don't, I expect the market will be back down 10% to 15%, which is where we were just a few weeks ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3041" target="_blank">00:50:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's still a lot of volatility out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">There's been a lot of talk about the 10-year rates, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing I just want to point out, because the 10-year rates have gone from 4.2 to bounce back up to 4.4, 4.5, and a lot of people are hand-wringing about this and saying this just goes to prove that we're in this national debt spiral and nobody wants to buy our debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I just want to point out –</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">How did they compare them to Spain and other countries that were in, you know, liquidity crisis not too long ago?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but I just want to point out, like several other people have, yields, the 10-year has been in a 4% to 5% range, Bill, for the last two years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, this is far – like there were people – remember Larry Summers at the end of 2022 saying that the 10-year is going to 7%, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what caused – we're going to have hyperinflation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3096" target="_blank">00:51:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What have we seen?</span></div><div class="c"><span

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We're now on a core PCE run rate that causes me to believe that the Fed will now reduce rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3107" target="_blank">00:51:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The market's saying they're going to cut rates twice in the back half of the year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3110" target="_blank">00:51:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we're still in restrictive territory.</span></div><div class="c"><span

rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the bond market to me at these levels is not that concerning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3123" target="_blank">00:52:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Seriously, I would like an important national discussion on a balanced budget amendment or some other mechanism to get us to this 3% target.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's super important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're saying, okay, should I be really scared that we're on a path to 7% interest rates over the course of the next six months?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.260</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:52:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if they sign the reconciliation bill and they land the deal on China, right, and then you get a couple rate cuts in the back half of the year because inflation continues to come in, this market's going to be a lot higher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3159"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3435" target="_blank">00:57:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you remember, but when we did, we did an episode early on about stock-based comp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3441" target="_blank">00:57:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And before that, I had reached out to ISS to talk about how they come up with their different, you know, philosophies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was very clear to me that there was no one there thinking from a first principles perspective about, you know, what are the types of policies or actions that a board could take, that a comp committee could take, that would align interests with shareholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3463" target="_blank">00:57:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I would think that if you run a large index fund, if you're BlackRock or whatever, and you're voting, you know, your shares for or against different policies, that the number one thing you should care about, perhaps the only thing you should care about, is whether they're looking after the interest of shareholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we clearly crept away from that in the past, you know, 10 or 20 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The senator that you're talking about said when he was giving this talk that these two companies are now both over 80% owned outside the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3499" target="_blank">00:58:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3501" target="_blank">00:58:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And that they both have corporate philosophies that extend beyond what we just talked about, which, you know, I've always, I grew up in the school that fiduciary duty is the number one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3511" target="_blank">00:58:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And responsibility of all board members, and that means looking after, you know, shareholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think, you know, that two things should happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, first, I do wonder, and this would be a question for the senator, like, why are so many companies paying attention to what these people say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Are they just loyal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3535" target="_blank">00:58:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, are they just lazy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Do they not want to do the work themselves?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And admittedly, if you're running an index fund, you're on thin margins, so maybe you don't have time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3544" target="_blank">00:59:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But they should wake up and realize that they're not solely looking after the interest of shareholders and they have other interests in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And ironically, and this gets back to policy, one of the key reasons so many companies have super voting is so that these two companies can't tell them what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3564" target="_blank">00:59:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, it's ironic because most people think of super voting shares as being less good governance, you know, a lesser form of good governance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But if these companies that are measuring you and telling, you know, index investors how to vote aren't looking after shareholder interests, then you may need to take that step precisely to get away from them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I would encourage, you know, the BlackRock's and all the ETF people to not just simply vote with what these people say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe what we need, maybe we need an alternative to these two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qG_f2DY_3M&t=3601" target="_blank">01:00:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You and I have, you know, talked about SBC.</span></div><div class="c"><span
