href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=58">00:00:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I discovered Simula, which was absolutely great.</span></div><div class="c"><span

polymorphism</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=77">00:01:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">when they were... while they were doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=81">00:01:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the language that taught me that you could have the sort of the problems of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=89">00:01:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a program grow

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=96">00:01:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That is, you can actually modularize very nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=100">00:01:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was a surprise to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=103">00:01:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It was also a surprise to me that a stricter type system than Pascal's was helpful, whereas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=111">00:01:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Pascal's type system got in my way all the

code well, but it has to be extensible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=123">00:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=124">00:02:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's get into the details a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=126">00:02:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you remember, what kind of type system did Pascal have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=130">00:02:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">What type system, typing system did Algor60 have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=134">00:02:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, Pascal was sort of the simplest language that Niklaus Wirt could define that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=142">00:02:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">served the needs of Niklaus Wirt at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=146">00:02:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has a sort of a highly moral tone to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=151">00:02:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That is, if you can say it in Pascal, it's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=155">00:02:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you can't, it's not so good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=158">00:02:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And this simula allowed you basically to build your own type system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=166">00:02:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of trying to fit yourself into Niklaus Wirt's world, Christian Nygaard's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=174">00:02:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">language and Ole Johan Dahl's language allowed you to build your own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=179">00:02:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's sort of close to the original idea of you build a domain-specific language as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=187">00:03:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a matter of fact, what you build is a set of types and relations among types that allows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=194">00:03:14.920</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">So when you say types, the stuff you're saying has echoes of object-oriented programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=204">00:03:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, they invented it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=207">00:03:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Every language that uses the word class for type is a descendant of simula.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=215">00:03:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We are indirectly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=218">00:03:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Christian Nygaard and Ole Johan Dahl were mathematicians and they didn't think in terms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=224">00:03:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of types, but they understood sets and classes of elements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=231">00:03:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they called their types classes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=234">00:03:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically in C++, as in simula, classes are user-defined type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=241">00:04:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So can you try the impossible task and give a brief history of programming languages from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=248">00:04:08.400</a></span> | <span

60, Simula, Pascal, but that's just the 60s and 70s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=257">00:04:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I can try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=259">00:04:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The most sort of interesting and major improvement of programming languages was Fortran, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=267">00:04:27.520</a></span> | <span

was written for a specific machine and each specific machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=274">00:04:34.840</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=283">00:04:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But you are writing for a specific machine in the language of that machine.</span></div><div

write what you really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=300">00:05:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted.</span></div><div

people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=306">00:05:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now these people happened to be engineers and physicists, so the language that came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=310">00:05:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">out was somewhat unusual for the rest of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=313">00:05:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically they said formula translation because they wanted to have the mathematical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=318">00:05:18.240</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=329">00:05:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that the humans used and the way humans thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3W56e9j4UY&t=334">00:05:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they had a program that translated it into the machines needs.</span></div><div
