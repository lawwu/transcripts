I was, I was bullied a lot, mostly because of my size, but also just because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was, you know, not, I was not the cool kid. And then when I found skateboarding, there were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a bunch of people like me all trying to find their way and, and they, they all connected through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">skateboarding. Yeah. I, I look back to my childhood and I remember like those days I was not the cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">kid. I was like the computer nerd and skateboard nerd. And you know, you found our tribe, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">will. Yeah. I didn't have, I think the determination you did. I remember all I wanted was to skate at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like an amazing level and it just never clicked for me. I found determination other places later</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in life, but it was so hard. You, I've seen, you know, documented, fortunately, a lot of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">experiences in life are documented against all odds, against all pain. You know, I, I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">watching the X games in, in 99, where you're trying to do your 900 is, you know, 12 times in a row,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">falling, falling, even this year, trying to kick flip for five, 10 minutes after surgery. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what do you think allows you to go and just keep going? Because I remember sitting in the garage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to kick flip for hours. And then I just, I just gave up at some point and I just couldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">keep going. I think firstly, that I have convinced myself that whatever it is I'm trying is possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just have to figure out the right approach to make it so. And that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that comes in a lot of forms. But, but I do feel like, especially if I go to try a new trick,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, I have every element of this trick. I know how to spin. I know how to flip my board. I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have landed in similar fashions. So it's like, how do I combine all those elements to make this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">one thing work? And I think I, I rely on that so much that I'll, I'm willing to push through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pain and exhaustion to get there. It doesn't always work. I mean, like when you talk about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you saw the 900 was 12 tries. Those 12 tries are representative of thousands of tries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried that trick for 10 years. So 12 tries was nothing. You know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a 12 I got to witness. No, but I'm saying, but, but you, but,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but I understand that if people saw that from the outside, they're like, Oh, he won't give up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, yeah, you have no idea how deep that not give up goes, especially for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that particular move. Um, I would try dozens of tries in one session only to walk away with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">broken rib. So heal up and come back and do it again, heal up and come back and try again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually after the broken rib that put me on pause that, that one, I had actually stepped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">away from that trick after getting hurt like that. Um, and at some point thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I've given it everything I have, I've fully committed to it and that's what happens. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe it's not in the cards at the time. Did you think I'm quitting on this endeavor or I did?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, actually after, after I broke my rib, I was like, I, I had every element, I had every piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. I had the landing, I had everything. And so if it didn't work, it's never going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in that one instance at the X games, the reason I even tried it was because it was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">best trick event. I had a trick in mind for what I wanted to do that I had made once before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I thought I'm just going to try it. That's my best trick. I'm going to try to get to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">trick. And I got to it very early. So I didn't really have anything else planned. And so the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">announcer actually at the time, the announcer that was on site said, Oh, let's see one of those 900</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">attempts. That's what, that's what started it. Was that part of your being was being encouraged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">by others or was it internal motivation? No, I mean, I, I think that I probably would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">tried it anyway. Cause it's like, yeah, that, that would be my next trick that I'd like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">accomplish would be the next best trick for sure. Um, and so I tried it more to appease the crowd,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Oh, this is what, this is what it looks like. And then somewhere around the third or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">fourth try, my, my speed was consistent. My spin was consistent. I started spotting the landing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And in previous attempts, I only ever spotted the landing, maybe one out of five tries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because the ramps were all pretty terrible back then. You couldn't, you couldn't rely on the speed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or they weren't, they weren't, um, uh, the walls weren't the same. So you're always kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">struggling to adjust. And that ramp was built really well. So I didn't have to struggle with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the, with the construction. It was more like I could rely on the speed and the, the trueness of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So, so after about my fourth, third or fourth try that I'm, I can see it. I see it every time I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">might as well try to make it again. And when I did try to make it the first time, when I tried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to put it on the wall, I fell forward, but I didn't fall forward so hard that I got hurt again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the key because it was like, Oh, maybe I can adjust, I can adjust the landing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can try to get more in my back foot. And then I, I turned, I made, I basically shifted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">my weight mid spin so that when my landed, I was more on the back foot and I was too far on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">back foot. And then I shot at backwards. We call that shooting out. Um, so the first one, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">too top heavy. I fell forward the second one, the ones I tried to make. And then that next one I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">shot out. And it was like, that, that was the magic moment because it was like, well, split the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">difference and that's it. And then that's when it worked. Wow. So, so it sounds like you, you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">gotten close to giving up, but are there things that someone listening, let's say someone listening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is hearing this story. They're like, this guy's not afraid of anything. Are there other, other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">sports, other things in life that you're, that you have fear from? Oh, for sure. I like, I surf</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't like big surf. I don't, people say, you know, you ride these giant ramps. Yeah. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if I fall, the giant ramp doesn't crash on top of me and hold me underwater. You know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's I, I, I just never, my brother was, he is a surfer. Um, and that's how I got into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">skateboarding, my older brother. And, um, but when I would go surf with him and he wanted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like, he's, he has plenty of experience. He'd go out to pretty heavy stuff. And it's just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't that I like riding a big wave, but I don't, I don't want to suffer the consequences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of falling on one. I mean, having my first experience surfing was a friend of mine took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">me and he was like, let's just try these on a short board. I had no idea what I was doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Not, not a great first experience on a short board. Uh, and then the next one was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Hawaii long board, super chill. I was like, Oh, I could get back into this. Well, I'll tell you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I have since I have surfed through my years because my brother wouldn't allow me to exist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">without at least a foot, a foot or a toe in the water, so to speak. But I, um, have, I have fallen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in love with the wave machines, the wave pools, because they are consistent. Um, they're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">too scary. Um, and they are like skate parks because when you go surfing out in the wild,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you never really know what you're going to get, right? You get waves and sometimes they're good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they're not good. Um, you've got to figure out kind of how to navigate nature and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where the swell is going to hit. Those things are, the waves are always good. They're, they're always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to barrel. And so in that sense, you have what, what I consider a skate park to try to learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">tricks and try to learn techniques. So yeah, I get it. It's not like, it's not the purest thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not, you're not out in nature, but, um, but for me, it's just a controlled environment and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">very much feels like skateboarding.

Did you ever figure out or,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or do you know the secret to applying that to something else? I think for my personal life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there are things where I'm like, I'm wildly obsessed with optimizing travel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, but that doesn't mean that I can take that same thing and apply it necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to go learn a kickflip though.

Um, I think this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is more of that.

I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with parenting, especially it's so easy to get frustrated and give up. It really is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I, I get it.

And that is really hard. And so, but I learned that through skating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and I learned, and I've had plenty of kids, so I've had time to figure it out even more so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but I think that it's, it's just more that I, and I learned the value of persistence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and determination and you do see the results eventually, but they're not, it's, it's not some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not some wow moment always.

We didn't have iPhones or anything like that. So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">was more like, all right, we're like, I remember I took my son, my oldest son.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">don't, I can't, where do we go?

I think it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">safety risk. I think it's a weapon or I assume. Yeah. I mean, also Mexico too, surprisingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't carry a skateboard on the airplane in Mexico. So every time we travel with the kids,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Mexico, we've got to put them all in plastic bags. So we're just this, we're a disaster coming back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">cause we're just a bunch of luggage. Um, so yeah, that's my, that's my advice. I don't know if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a hack, it's just my advice. Like if you're going to travel through Europe, don't carry your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">skateboard onto the plane that is connecting. That could probably apply to other items. There</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are some, I can't remember, not that it's the end of the world to replace things like nail scissors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's some nail clippers. There's some country where you can't bring nail clippers on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">your plane.

So I would say if the hack is to look up, what are the security requirements for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the country you're transiting through? Uh, or, you know, I try at all costs to fly direct just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to avoid these problems when possible. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Um, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there used to be, I live in San Diego, but I live in North County and you used to be able to fly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">from Carlsbad airport to LAX. And so basically you could go anywhere from LAX. Right. So that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was always like the best way to do it. But, um, many times our Carlsbad flight would be canceled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we just have to drive, you know, literally drive to Carlsbad airport, like a couple of flights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">canceled. Just keep going North to LAX. Um, but, uh, yeah, it's funny with the, with the skateboard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. I remember, so my wife and I usually carry our skateboards when we go places. Cause we like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to, we like to skate around cities, you know, just as transportation, um, if we're going by ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're coming back from, oh man, I can't remember where somewhere. Um, and I think we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">were coming back from Brazil maybe. And we were coming through the, um, where you hand them your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">customs form. And the guy, I'll never forget this. He grabbed my customs form and he saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">my skateboard in his peripheral. And immediately it was like, go that way to secondary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause he saw my skateboard. It was so obvious the way that his, you know what I mean? Like I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just saw his wheelchair and like, oh, he's a problem. He's a skateboarder. And he looked up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and he saw my face and he recognized it, but he'd already handed me this red card to go to secondary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And he goes, oh, oh, you know what? Just tell them you're in a hurry. I said, oh, is that going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">work for me? You're sending me to secondary where they're going to go through all my stuff. And I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">going to tell him I'm in a hurry. That's probably not the best approach. And then my wife and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">got into secondary. They wouldn't let us go to the bathroom. They wouldn't, you know, we were like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we were very much, um, uh, being interrogated. Yeah. I mean, you've, you've told lots of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">stories. I'll, I'll encourage anyone here to go check out the internet for all the stories of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you getting recognized as other people.

You don't care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Um, yeah, I, I, it still happens all the time. And it's weird now because obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as you would know that, that, that meme kind of took off, um, or not the meme, but just me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">telling my story, like all the stories that tell it are absolutely true. 100%. Um, but it started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">happening. So it would happen pretty frequently and I was sharing it. And at some point people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">thought I was making it up. So I kind of stopped sharing these incidents because people were just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like, come on, like, really? But now it's gotten to the point where it's like this, this vicious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">cycle where people now want to say it, even though they know who I am all the time. So I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that happens probably three times a day. That, that interaction, like anyone ever tell you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you look like Tony Hawk. Yup. And you're the first today. Um, but then, but then it happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">genuinely at least once or twice too. And the, when it happens genuinely, if people were following me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">around, they wouldn't believe it. Cause you know what I mean? Like they just, they hear about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2002" target="_blank">00:33:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's just like, all right, like enough with this non, you know, this, this whole, um, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2008" target="_blank">00:33:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">even know what you call it. Mistaken identity thing. Yeah. But the, so yes, it still happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It happens as a joke. It happens for real. The, the, I think my favorite one as of late was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I was sitting at a gate and this guy was sitting across from me at the gate. Um, and he, he looked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he came over, he's a man, you know, you look just like Tony Hawk. He said, oh yeah, I know. I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">heard that. He's like, it's crazy. And then he went and sat back down and then a group of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">came who did recognize me for real and wanted autographs and pictures. And the whole time he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">watching me laughing because he's in on the joke that it's not really me. Do you know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like he and I are sharing this inside joke somehow that these people are crazy and they're mistaken,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but he just thought it was hilarious. Did you ever tell him at the end? Or did he ever? No,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't. I, I just, it's up to them to, you know what I mean? To either decide that or to ask me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it drives my daughter crazy because a lot of times people will say it until you look like Tony Hawk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, yeah, they, yeah. And it's, that's cool. And they walk away and my daughter's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">why didn't you tell him? I go, he didn't ask. So if someone asks, you'll say, yeah, of course. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Well, I hope whoever was sitting across from you at the airport is listening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and they can finally come to terms with the fact that that was way more fun in his mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">making fun of people. Yeah. Like that was, that was his thing. So I just let him run with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So to round out travel, you know, I'm sure you buy lots of things. Do you, do you play the points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">game? Do you try to rack up points or cash back on credit cards to travel for free still?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. I, I try to, well, I try to focus in on, you know, one or two airlines or their partners so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that I rack up the most points on, on them which is for the most part United and Delta. But also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">all my credit card purchases go towards miles. And so I use those for my team. So for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we have the skater Felipe Nunez from Brazil. You might've seen him. He's a double amputee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2142" target="_blank">00:35:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and he skates with he skates like kind of sitting on his board, but he's amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's crazy.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in Curitiba, so for me to get him flights is always really tricky and challenging, but I do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">using my visa points and I can get him his flights all the time. So anybody, he has to travel with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a handler and it's a whole thing.

I use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">him for my other skaters flights if they need to get somewhere for a skate trip or whatever. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's been, it's been awesome.

I think in the early days it, I didn't, I didn't recognize the importance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of, of my diet and training and whatnot, but I was so obsessed with skating that that was all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">my exercise. And that was enough because I was skating three to four hours a day, every day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">um, giving it a mile. So I think that over time I, and also just seeing my peers, I saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of them not take care of themselves, drinking too much, partying and, and really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of losing their skillsets. And so skating was always such a paramount importance to me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2428" target="_blank">00:40:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that I was never going to let that happen.

But as I grew older,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">then I realized the importance of, of diet and of trying to stay active when I can't skate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, especially at my age and with my, my current recovery, um, I I've learned that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=2460" target="_blank">00:41:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">got to stay active.

And then when I did pull away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I got very creative with my skating and I was able to really learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of different techniques and a lot of stuff that I wanted to pursue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">even though I wasn't making a living at it at the time. I mean, I kind of was, I still had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">signature skateboards and whatnot, but when you're not in those years, if you were not competing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3588" target="_blank">00:59:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actively, you were not going to get coverage.

And so it gave me this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of new energy to come back to competing and with a different approach that was more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3608" target="_blank">01:00:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it was more, I don't know how to explain it.

That was it. I came, I came at it with a, with a sense of, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3624" target="_blank">01:00:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to just try everything. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. I'd rather just do this and take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the chances and have fun doing it.

So I came back with this renewed energy and I was winning a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of big events. And all of a sudden it was like, what happened? Where's the crowd? Where's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">contest? Where's the prize money? You guys like turn the machines back on. I thought this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3654" target="_blank">01:00:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">cool. And so I, you know, it was kind of like the wrong place at the right time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3659" target="_blank">01:00:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But you probably wouldn't have had the career you had after that had that not happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no.

It was just that I wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3675" target="_blank">01:01:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it in front of crowds because the crowds weren't there anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3679" target="_blank">01:01:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think I'm very fortunate that, and I think you did the same with your podcast. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3683" target="_blank">01:01:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">when you start a podcast, if you can start it, not needing to be your, your job and your business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you could do whatever you want with it.

This podcast was not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3692" target="_blank">01:01:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, when I started it, I never thought I'd be going over countries as episodes. And then I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">was like, yeah, I'm going to London. I want to talk to someone who knows everything about London.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's make an episode about London. And then we do it on Japan. So I think when you really start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to do what you're passionate about in your work, it sometimes creates an even better experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3709" target="_blank">01:01:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And people love these episodes. And I never had an idea, but.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah. No, I think, well, my, my cohost, Jason Ellis and I, we have a lot of, of, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a lot of experience, obviously skating, but just life experience. He, he was, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">had a totally different path than I did. And when we have guests, especially with non-skating guests,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we relate to them in different ways that people would not expect, but, but in a very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in a very parallel way. Um, for instance, we had two wrestlers on, uh, that's our most recent guest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and Darby Allen and Jamie Hader. And people were like, why would you have them on? And then when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we started to talk about our experiences and our injuries, we were right in line and we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">bouncing off of each other. And it was a really great conversation. It was fascinating, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and say what you will about, about wrestling or that it's made up or whatever it is. They are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">those guys take as much abuse as skateboarders. Yeah. It was great. I listened to this episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was wild to kind of, I don't think I've gotten that behind the scenes look at wrestling. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it hasn't been a passion of mine, but it was super fascinating and you don't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3779" target="_blank">01:02:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">say who, but I know there's some cool guests coming down the pike. So if anyone's listening,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, we have, um, we have a, an insane roster coming up and, and, uh, I feel like now we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3790" target="_blank">01:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">starting to hit our stride and we've been doing it a couple of years. So you're right. It wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something that we needed and, but we enjoy doing it. And we did find that we had something unique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3798" target="_blank">01:03:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to offer. We found a groove, we found an audience. Um, it was just that we weren't doing all the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the right things with the algorithms and the, you know, the promotions. And so now we, we have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3811" target="_blank">01:03:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">group, uh, Malka that is, um, is taking the reins on that and they've been doing a great job. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3817" target="_blank">01:03:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we get to focus more on the content.

Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3822" target="_blank">01:03:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">especially, especially cause I have my, my childhood skate skate dreams still somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3826" target="_blank">01:03:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">buried in my head for anyone else listening.

Uh, we have the Hawk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">versus Wolf podcast. Um, I think if anything, my, my energy also is directed towards the skate park</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3863" target="_blank">01:04:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">project, which is my foundation for public skate parks in underserved areas. Um, we have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it over 20 years now. We've helped to fund over a thousand skate parks, um, in the U S alone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3876" target="_blank">01:04:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we have a couple of, um, international projects as well. And I think that's my proudest work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3880" target="_blank">01:04:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because when I was growing up skating, the skate park was my salvation. I know I was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I was an outcast kid.

And, and I was very lucky that, that the park that I grew up skating at was one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3896" target="_blank">01:04:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">last ones in the U S in the mid eighties, there were only a handful.

So when I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in a position to advocate and to possibly affect change, that's what I, that's what I focused in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3917" target="_blank">01:05:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on was, was public skate parks. Yeah. I mean, I grew up kind of at the, the born in the early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">eighties and that I was in that kind of dearth of, of lack of skate parks, skate parks. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3927" target="_blank">01:05:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">think my community was like the guy that lived across the street that had a skateboard. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that was it, right.

And, and also that these kids that they find something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3936" target="_blank">01:05:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they love, right.

Yeah. Or they're a nuisance. They put things to prevent you from doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3948" target="_blank">01:05:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, this kid has finally found something that speaks to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you're discouraging them from that.

Um, and, uh, the, I think the best part about the foundations, we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51pM6_cfcNc&t=3974" target="_blank">01:06:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we try to empower groups that are already doing it themselves or trying to do it themselves.
