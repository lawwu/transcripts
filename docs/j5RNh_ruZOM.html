Are they all like this?" And we gave some advice to young people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is actually relatively simple in these times. It's just Nick Majulia, his book, Don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Stop Buying or Just Keep Buying. That's pretty much it. You don't stop investing because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a bear market. You actually want to keep investing for sure then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the advice for young people is pretty simple. Keep saving. Don't get scared out of the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, we had a couple retirees who said, "That's great. That's easy for young</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">people. Not easy. Simple, but not easy for young people." What do you say to retirees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">dealing with this? "I don't have the human capital anymore. I'm not saving. I don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as much time. And I'm dealing with this bear market in stocks and bonds. What do you think?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, here's what I tell a retiree. The good news is, the returns for a diversified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">investor have been lights out coming into this year. So I just looked at the simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">three-fund Vanguard portfolio.

That's a three-fund Vanguard portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Through year-end 2021, before this year, over ten years, that portfolio of a 60/40 three-fund</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Vanguard was like 8.5% per year. For 60/40. And that's a time when bonds did pretty terribly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously, if you had more stocks, you did much better. That portfolio was down almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">20% this year. So that's what people are saying. "This is terrible. I just retired. What now?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if you include the 20% down this year, over the last ten years, it's still up 5%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">per year. That's with two bear markets and bonds giving you basically nothing. So, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you are more heavily in stocks, since 2012 the S&P is up like 12.5% per year. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">with this bear market.

If you're a retiree, you've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">building up financial assets for a while, you did pretty well heading into this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is just kind of the other side of those wonderful returns that you experienced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to this point.

There, for a while, it was like, bonds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">were so uncool, left for dead, no one wanted anything to do with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were kind of dead.

So, if you missed out a few weeks ago, I think it was the episode we did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with Josh. We did a tutorial on tips, and someone asked us at the time, "Why are tips</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">down when inflation is higher?" We did a whole thing on that. The short answer is, interest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">rates have risen. But the nice thing about rising rates for bonds, as I kind of mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit ago, is eventually those higher yields turn into higher future returns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, John, let's do a chart on for the five-year tips yield. So, this is from the Federal Reserve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see this is since 2010. And these are the yields on tips. And what this essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">is showing you is a yield on tips with, again, this is Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The yield you get here, you tack on inflation to it. So, you can see, throughout from 2020</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">through late 2021, you were getting negative yields in tips. And so, it was close to -2%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you could add inflation on top of that. So, if your yield was -2%, you're basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">buying that bond at a discount. And then, if inflation was 3%, your total return would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">be 1%. Well, now, yields in tips, because interest rates across the board have come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">up, they've gone from -2% to almost +2% in a hurry, because rates are rising everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what does this mean? It means tips are way more attractive. We haven't had yields</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">this high since pre-Great Financial Crisis. So, why does this matter? Well, back when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">yields were -2%, even higher inflation would be eaten up by that. So, now you have +2%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">plus inflation. So, that means your starting point is 4% higher from expected return level</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in a little less than a year. That's how much rates have come up. So, let's say the Fed's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">able to bring inflation under control, and they get it down to 3% or 4%. Interest rates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">just stabilize. They don't go down, they don't go up. We're talking about a 5% or 6% expected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">return in tips, taking away the variability of interest rates and inflation and all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">things. That's amazing, when you think about it. Or, let's say they're not as successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Inflation is 4% or 5%. I think this is a wonderful -- so, the general rule of thumb for tips</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is, if they get to a 3% to 4% nominal yield, that's like a screaming buying opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you add inflation onto that, that's about as good as you're going to get. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">very rare.

So, it's very rare. And even 2% is relatively rare. I honestly wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">expect these yields to last very long. 2% in tips is pretty darn attractive for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there are some caveats, because Seamus is asking, "Should I use this for my emergency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">fund?"

That's just obviously fantastic. And Tyler's made some good decisions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to get there where he is in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So ultimately, my diagnosis, though, is his current tax rate is probably going to be identical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to his future tax rate.

So ultimately, it's just a question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I want to pay tax on $20,000 of income, $6,000 of tax?

Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately, yeah, the after-tax value of that Roth is 30% higher, in my math for Mr. Tyler,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">than it is if it's pre-tax, right?

But Ben, the question I want to look at is, if he's got 1 point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">6-- again, great for him-- $1.6 million in Roth and $1.1 million in IRA, is that too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">much? Is that too much of a balance for somebody at 64? What do you think?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, so I guess you're saying the idea is, since he's paying the taxes now, his balance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">could be bigger in retirement if he didn't pay the taxes now, because he'd be saving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that money and investing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but it depends on what game he's playing. Yeah, so I think my general theory-- and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is the problem that I think Roth solved-- is that people tend to optimize for their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">net worth. What I really think they should be optimizing for is after-tax spending. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if I'm 64, just actually, how much time do I have left? 20 years? And ultimately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm doing these Roth conversions. I think it's wise to do that up to 24%. But what for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? What am I doing this for? And ultimately, at some point, you would want to think about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">am I doing this because I want to pass on these assets to my children tax-free? This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">is a great thing to do. If it's a charitable intent, I would stop Roth conversions now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">because you can just give that IRA to charity and make the charitable a beneficiary, a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">university, a public library, or something like that. And they can get all that money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">without you paying the tax. Right? So I think, ultimately, I would sit down and maybe think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">about, why am I doing this at this point? And I think somebody that's got 2/3 or, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">say, 55% of their assets in Roth, it almost strikes me as that's the limit. That's about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">as far as I would want to go. Right. They're almost like a 60/40. That seems like they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">got plenty of cover, especially with the pension, too. Yep. Yep. Because ultimately, when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">get to 72, you have RMDs start to kick in.

And ultimately, if you have that very large Roth bucket, what is the plan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">What are you going to do with that?

So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">when you win the game, you stop playing.

I'm 43 and I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">done pretty well. I have about $3 million in real estate with very little debt, $1.2</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">million, which was $1.5 in equities, but only about $30,000 in a Roth IRA. At some point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">should I just even taxes and do a backdoor Roth? All right. Mark's doing pretty well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">here.

Does that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tie into this at all?

I think we need to get populist with this. Here's the way that I think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it, though. I worked in the institutional world, and I was dealing with-- Is that where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you got that vest? Where did that come from? But I was working with portfolios that had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">8, 9, 10 figures. And the way I thought about it, after a certain point, is it's just an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">extra zero. These people are all dealing with the same problems. Same questions. In a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of ways. Obviously, there's more comfort here when you have a seven-figure portfolio when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you're in your 40s. But it's still the same questions and the same worries. The math is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">more fun when it's big numbers. It's true. Yeah. Let's just pretend Mark has $3,000 in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">real estate. OK. So yeah. A backdoor Roth isn't going to solve your problem, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You can stick $6,000 into a backdoor Roth IRA. So I think he's asking a different question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, than what he said. I think he's saying, should I Roth convert? And the year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that I would Roth convert would maybe be a year-- I don't know-- US equities are down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">20%. And maybe our bonds have taken a hit, too. And maybe we're-- oh, I'm describing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this exact scenario, right? Where we've had a punishing year, and ultimately, the cost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of converting is going to be lower if we expect our future returns to be higher. So yes. Without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing Mark's full situation, again, I would urge him to hire a financial planner to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">answer this. But yeah. He's probably got a 40-year runway on life, maybe 45 years. Ultimately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a great time to think about it, because we've been punishing-- unless he's been in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">cash this whole year, he's probably down 20%, 30% in his equities. And ultimately, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is a great year to consider it, because the taxes are going to be low today on any amounts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=2002" target="_blank">00:33:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he chooses to convert. Let's go back to question 3. The questioner was thinking, OK, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to fill up my 24% bracket. I think that's the thing to think about, Mark. If you count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in all your income this year, where are you going to be in the tax code? Where does it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">make sense? And that's the starting point that I'd look at. And you've got about three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RNh_ruZOM&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks, three months to figure it out between now and the end of the year.
