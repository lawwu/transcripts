this was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">other thing that I did not expect at all like starting in this space was uh we don't not only do we not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">know if things work sometimes they do and they work in ways we didn't expect and so I feel like our job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as product people is to discover functionality is what are the right building blocks right what are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.040</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and can we discover emergent behavior and that is one of the reasons that like this is the most exciting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">time I've ever

target="_blank">00:07:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and that sort of became the new job in a sense is discovering what's possible because if you asked me</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:07:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right so how do you we communicate to a development team to a backlog how do you communicate exactly what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">should be happening it's like Figma doesn't like have the affordances for this right my my PRD doesn't like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.720</a></span> | <span

concepts right so I think these are like the three you know high level uh ways that um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">our practice needs to change but like let's make it a little more concrete okay so evals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

I feel bad for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">eval come like how do you illustrate an eval so I'm going to make you just look at pictures of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">various teammates from you know across all of our customers um okay who hates raising their hand at</span></div><div class="c"><span

question which is okay for the engineers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">here who like legit like don't lie like writes and runs their evals good number and of the product people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">who has visibility into the evals there's a that's not bad and and do you look at them just because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the visibility all right one one and a half two okay great so I would posit that evals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">actually I'll back up right so we all talk about evals we're all going to be embarrassed to say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't really know what they are evals are a testing framework for probabilistic AI for agents right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like if we think about the uh deterministic code right I withdraw 100 from the ATM my bank account</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">should have 100 less right great and I can test that and I can write code to test that when the test is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like was she snarky in slack it's like well how do you test that how do you write that test right so we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">come up with this whole new discipline of evals which is well she should be a little bit snarky and a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bit funny but not mean and then we hand it off to another LLM to say okay well hey was that reply like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">did it meet that criteria and how often did it um it doesn't have to be 100 right so she should be like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty snarky but like not mean 80 percent of the time or whatever the uh uh business logic that you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">right so these are evals and this is the world of evals but here's what I would posit which is it is the only way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that we know what our software can do right and which is why I love the idea of product people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at the evals right looking at uh because they become the new specification for the product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right and so as we're watching you know if you're downstairs in the expo gallery you're seeing like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">new software it's like hey bring the team in and this little bit reminds me of like the old you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for the the old timers here like behavior driven development there was this period of time and it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">oh the business people are going to write the tests and that will get converted to code and then the code will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">run and like the truth is like no one ever wanted to do that like no business I don't even know who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a business person is but like they want we're going to do that but I actually think this is different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think this is pretty um a meaningful way to actually understand what the product can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and a little bit begin to specify what it can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so I have vibe coding for a second which we which we all do we all talk about we don't talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">vibe coding in a in a way that's really constructive and how do I sort of say this it's very very hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I kind of was like oh you can't do it in Figma you can't do it in a PRD like what do I really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">mean well it's very hard to like sit down in front of a blank piece of paper and um write what the teammate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the agent experience should be it's just really hard it's hard to like imagine it and it's not until you feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it I mean so much of what we're doing in this like human computer interface is visceral it's feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it is like oh well like do they ask too many questions like how many questions is too many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">oh it wouldn't it be great if they clarified exactly what you meant well it turns out that's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">annoying but when I wrote like the first spec I'm like then the teammate should ask a lot of clarifying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">questions and we gave it to users and they're like this sucks and I was like how would I've ever known that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and the answer is because it's so easy to prototype and vibe code something and get the feels and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the next thing that I'm like pretty excited about as a new product management tool it is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">able to feel and experience what it's like to interact with a computer but uh without just like uh writing it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or hoping that you have a clickable prototype that will work I will also mention that we have to be careful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">with vibe coding because I do not mean sit in the meeting and say to the engineering team how come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this is taking two weeks I finished the feature during the meeting like that doesn't that doesn't win</span></div><div class="c"><span

feel the the experience right and so this is like the only way I know to like actually test and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">feel it out but do you um do you remember like the the Claude um certainty issue certainly I mean certainly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it was this period right every time you ask Claude to be like certainly and like that probably like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">seemed really good when you're testing it for the very first time and then like the fourth time when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PthmdT92qNg&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you're like hey can you do my taxes like certainly can you write my like acceptance speech certainly</span></div><div class="c"><span
