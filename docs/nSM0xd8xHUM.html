And I don't think we I think it will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">great. When we do it, I think we'll be thoughtful about how we do it. Like we may release it in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">different way than we've released previous models.

Since we've released it, and particularly over the last few months, I think I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like a better hint of what the world looks like, where it's not the like 1234567.

Does that mean that there's not going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">long training cycles, and it's continuously retraining or training sub models, Sam,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe you could just speak to us about what might change architecturally going forward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with respect to large models? Well, I mean, one one. One thing that you could imagine is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">just that you keep training, right model, that that would seem like a reasonable thing to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think we talked about releasing it differently this time? Are you thinking maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">releasing it to the page users first or, you know, a slower rollout to get the red teams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">tight since now there's so much at stake, you have so many customers actually paying and you've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody watching everything you do.

And this idea that we build AI tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and make them super widely available, free or, you know, not that expensive, whatever it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so that people can use them to go kind of invent the future, rather than the magic AGI in the sky,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">inventing the future and showing it down upon us. That seems like a much better path. It seems like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a more inspiring path. I also think it's where things are actually heading. So it makes me sad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have not figured out how to make GPT four level technology available to free users. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">something we really want to do. It's just very expensive. It's very expensive. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">To mock your thoughts, I think maybe the the two big vectors, Sam, that people always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about is that underlying cost and sort of the latency that's kind of rate limited,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a killer app. And then I think the second is sort of the long term ability for people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to build in an open source world versus a closed source world. And I think the crazy thing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this space is that the open source community is rabid. So one example that I think is incredible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is, you know, we had these guys do a pretty crazy demo for Devon, remember, like even like five or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">six weeks ago, that looked incredible. And then some kid just published it under an open MIT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">license, like open Devon. And it's incredibly good, and almost as good as that other thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that was closed source.

But let's say if you go read a bunch of math on the internet and learn how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do math, that, I think, seems unobjectionable to most people.

I actually, let me ask you about that. So the mission of open AI is explicitly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&t=3459" target="_blank">00:57:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to create AGI, which I think is really interesting.
