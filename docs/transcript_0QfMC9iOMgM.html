And even since I wrote The Most Important Century series and before that, there were years when Open Philanthropy was very interested in AI risk, but it's become more so as we've seen the progress in AI.</p><p>What we're seeing is we're seeing these very simple systems and is able to do a lot of different tasks. This very simple language model that just predicts the next word it's going to see in a stream of text. People have gotten it to tell stories. People got it to analyze and explain jokes.</p><p>People have gotten it to play kind of role-playing games, write poetry, write lyrics, answer multiple choice questions, answer trivia questions. And one of the results that I found most ridiculous and strange was this thing called Minerva where people took one of these language models and with very little intervention, very little special intervention, they got it to do these like difficult math problems and explain its reasoning and get them right about half the time.</p><p>And so I think that we just see AI systems having all these unpredictable human-like abilities just from having this very simple training procedure. And that is something I find wild and scary. I don't know exactly where it's going or how fast.</p></div></div></body></html>
