So I'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7dL_sXjvfw&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">guess maybe from age 17 to 24, from when she was a virgin and then as a widow until she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7dL_sXjvfw&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was 84.
