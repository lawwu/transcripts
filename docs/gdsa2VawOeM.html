Okay, while that's starting up, I'll show you the other thing, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned the other day when we were talking about how do we create bash scripts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, we created that bash script run. And I said, oh, you know, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">use the Jupyter text editor if you want. But that's not how I would do it myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said, I would show you how I would do it myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way I would do it myself would be using a program called Vim. And Vim's a text editor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which has a somewhat deserved reputation for being a bit obscure and challenging,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but also for being powerful. And all of those things are true. And it's kind of something I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't normally cover in a beginner's guide, but in a guide of the things that are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">make your life better, I would certainly say, yeah, we do need to include it because it's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really quite terrific. But I don't want you to take my word for it. I wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">give you an example of how it works and why it's terrific. And so I thought a good example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">was one of the folks who's been following along on these. Let me just try to make this bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can see more faces. There we go. One of the folks who's been watching these courses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Daniel has been kind enough to create these timelines, which I think are actually really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">useful to remind yourself of what we covered. And they're useful for me because I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">use them to create timestamps in YouTube. So timestamps in YouTube, if I'll just show you an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">example. You see how at the bottom here, those little chapter markers appear?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And to make them appear, you basically have to have times in a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">format in the description. So I actually used Vim to turn Daniel's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing into those timestamps. And I thought that might be just a good example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of how Vim's a bit different to your average editor. By the way, you might have noticed when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I selected this, I actually selected it quite quickly. And the reason I did that was with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the keyboard. Most things I use have good keyboard bindings and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the forums have good keyboard bindings. If you just hit question mark, you'll see them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But they tend to be pretty consistent across programs. And you'll see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">J and K move the selection up and down. So if I press K, it moves the selection up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I press J, it moves it down. And it kind of selects it. And then if I hit A, it edits it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I can hit Apple A to select all, Apple C to copy. And you'll see that these keyboard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">shortcuts have a lot of overlap with Vim. And so it's kind of nice that as you do more stuff with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the keyboard, you start to realize you don't have to relearn everything from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I only just set up this Mac. And so I just installed Vim literally before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we started this session by typing "brew install vim." Because I'm trying to use a Mac a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And you need to set up Homebrew, which you can do from their website. And so when Vim opens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what it looks like. It's going to be pre-installed. I assume this is now running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It should be pre-installed on PaperSpace. So we should be able to use it straight away there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's taking a while to start for some reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Hello, I suppose it's sitting at the end of this session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">>> It's taking a while for me to...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah. That's okay. I don't have to watch it doing that. So while we're waiting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to go back to this one on my Mac. Okay. So here's Vim. So the first thing you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">notice if you start Vim... So if you're on... Actually, let's talk about different options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So on Linux, to run Vim, you would type "sudo apt..." Actually, let me do it in the Vim window</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">because otherwise it's going to autocomplete things in annoying ways. So in Linux to install Vim,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if you don't have it already, you would type "sudo apt install vim." On Mac, you would type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"brew install vim" after you've Googled for Mac, Brew, and installed Homebrew. Windows is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">be the same as Linux, of course, because it is Linux and WSL. And so once it's installed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just type Vim at the command line. And yeah, the window appears. And one thing you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">notice is if you start typing, nothing happens. Text doesn't appear. So that seems like a problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a text editor where when you type, it doesn't put text on the screen. What on earth is going on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's exactly actually the same as Jupyter Notebook, which is in Jupyter Notebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when it appears. So if I create a notebook...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If I start typing, nothing happens either, right? And that's because in a notebook, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to click inside a cell or press enter to go into edit mode. And then if I press escape,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm now in command mode and buttons do things rather than type. So for example, x cuts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Vim is the same. It's modal. You're either in a mode where you're entering and editing text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or you're in a command mode. So by default, just like in Jupyter, you're in a command mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So to go into edit mode, you press I. I stands for insert. So I can start if I press I, and it says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">down at the bottom here, insert. So now in insert mode, now if I type, it types. And then if I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to go back into command mode, I press escape. And if you don't see a mode, that means you're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">command mode. My arrows keys work as usual. And up and down work as usual. But one thing you might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">notice is in command mode, the same buttons that we use in discord for up and down J and K also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">work for going up and down. And it's not just J and K, it's actually all the letters in a row</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there are all movement. So J and K go up and down, and L and H go left and right. It's totally fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to use the arrow keys in your keyboard as well. And I would say honestly, probably for the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">couple of years of using VM, I always use the arrow keys. At some point, I started using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">HJKL all the time instead. I guess my fingers noticed they were a bit closer and I didn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to move. And they decided that they liked doing that better. That's fine. So yeah, so you can move</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">around. And so at this point, we can run VIM, we can enter text. And then the one thing we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">yet know how to do is to exit and save. So I almost never just type VIM. I almost always VIM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something. I want to VIM a file. So for example, let's say I wanted to VIM my .Z profile file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is one of the startup scripts that's run automatically when you start the terminal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I would type VIM space .ZP tab. And there it is. Okay. And so this is something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Bruce installed for me. So if I wanted to now edit this, maybe I wanted to put a comment above here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to go into edit mode. And I'll show you like the slow way to do this. I could press</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I for insert, I could press enter, I could press up, and I could start typing. So that'd be one way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so I could type my comment. Okay. And then press escape. Now, I want to show you a different way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to undo all that. So to undo the last thing you did, it's press U for undo, and U again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I is not the only way to go into edit mode. There's lots of ways to go into edit mode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to go into edit mode in different places. And one of them is to press O, which opens a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">line underneath. So that puts a new line underneath edit mode. And I want a new line above,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">which is shift O. Shift O is a new line above. So it's pretty common that like a letter and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the capitalized version of the letter in VIM are kind of related versions of similar things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I could put a comma here, shift O, auto added by homebrew installer, for example. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that's good. So now I want to save and close. So there's actually a third mode. There's not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">command mode and edit mode. There's also a mode they call EX mode, which is where you hit colon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when you hit colon, our cursor moves to the bottom, and you can enter various different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">commands here. So one of the commands you can enter is W for right. And so that will save.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So by default, it saves it to whatever I loaded it as. So it saved it back to .Z profile. I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">save it to something else by going W, you know, backup profile or something. And that would save</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it to that file name. Another useful EX command is Q, which quits. So colon Q quits. So if I now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">decide I don't want to capitalize that, so I'll change that to a small a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you can combine EX commands together. So to save and quit, you would type colon WQ right and quit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when people say how do I exit VIM, you'll normally hear people say colon WQ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why. And so by the way, what I just did there when I changed the big A to a small a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I did that in a single button press. And that's because the tilde command changes case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and moves one to the right. Okay. So this is an example of, you know, when you've got the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">keyboard available and shifted versions available, like there's a lot of things you can add, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then hit you a few times. So if I wanted to change the case of the next 10 letters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I could hit tilde 10 times. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I wouldn't do that because in VIM, you can always say before you do a, call it a verb,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">before you do like one of these, you know, letter command, single letter commands, you can type a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">number, which is how many times do you want to do it? So if I type 10, so if I type 10 tilde,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it runs at 10 times. And so this is where things start getting interesting, right? Because every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">single, you know, verb you can run in VIM, you can also say how many times to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, to delete a line, let me just create, oops, I've accidentally created far</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">too many lines. So to delete a line, you press DD. To delete five lines, you just press 5DD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So it's important to remember like everything you can do. You can put a number after it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, it's even more powerful. Because after most commands, you can also say, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">add something called a motion. A motion, for example, is right arrow moves right one, left arrow moves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">down one. Shift G goes to the bottom of a file. Motions are things that move your cursor around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that doesn't sound very exciting. Unless I tell you after a command, you can type a motion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and the command will apply to the region that that motion covers. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm currently on line three. And if I press shift G, shift G is the motion to go to the end of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">file. D is the command to delete. So I can combine these together. D, shift G will delete to the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of a file. D, shift G. Right? So that's pretty interesting. So GG takes you to the start of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">file. So to delete from here to the start of a file, D, G, G. Right? Or, you know, there's some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">really interesting motions. For example, let's create two bits. Right? There's a concept of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">paragraph. So right curly bracket takes you to the end of a paragraph. It takes you to the end to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">next empty line. Right? Press it again. So that means if I want to delete everything from here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to the end of the paragraph, I would kiss D, right curly bracket. Okay? Or if I want to do that twice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so delete from here to the end of the paragraph and also delete the next paragraph. Actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so let me show you. I want to copy this whole second bit and make a copy of it. So in VIM,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">copying something, it's not control or command C, it's called yanking. So you press Y. So I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">copy the next paragraph. So to copy this paragraph, I would press Y, right curly bracket. Okay? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">then to paste its P, and by default, it pastes it to the line underneath. To paste it to the line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">above, you won't be surprised to hear it's shift P. So there's a copy. Now I want to go down to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">next paragraph and change that to third bit. So I'll press right curly bracket. And I now want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">delete this word and replace it with a different one. Deleting and replacing in VIM is called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">changing. And that's C. And so like everything else, that can be combined with a motion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the motion to move to the next word is W. W goes to the next word, right? B goes back a word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So to delete this word and let me start typing in a new one, it would be change word, C, W, third bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? So if I want to delete from here to the end of the paragraph and the paragraph underneath,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I can just delete two paragraphs. So that would be 2D, right curly bracket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? So I would describe this as being highly compositional, right? You can kind of combine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers, motions, and commands together. And then we haven't even touched on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">EX, right? So let's talk about EX. So I'm going to delete to the end of the file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">D, shift G, and delete this line, DD, and colon WQ to exit. So I mentioned that we wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">change this into something suitable to put in a YouTube video. So I press E, Apple A, Apple C,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">cancel, and then I'll go VIM, I don't know, temporary, insert, Apple V,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">GG. Okay. So here I've just pasted in this text, right? And I want to clean this up. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to clean up the title. So I'll just press DD. And I want to do the same thing to the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">line. So to do the same thing you just did again, press dot. So that's going to delete the line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">again. Now, where this gets interesting is that will redo the entire, like, number, command,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">motion that you just did. So for example, if I press 4DW to delete four words, 4DW to delete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">four words, and then press dot, that deletes another four words. And so that can get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty interesting. So for example, oh, okay, I'll show you a really cool example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">To search in VIM, you use slash, which is pretty common in a lot of different tools. And so if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">want to search, I don't know how many of you are familiar with regular expressions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but you can put any regular expression here. If I wanted to search for the next timestamp that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Daniel created, I'd want to find a digit at the start of the line, right? So to go to the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">place where there's a digit at the start of the line, regular expressions use caret for start of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">line and backslash D for digit. So this is going to search, there you go, and selects the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">digit at the start of the line. To search again, press N, N, right? So this is kind of cool, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what we could do now is if I want to delete everything up to the next digit at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">start of the line, well, slash is a motion. So I could type D slash caret backslash D,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and that searches for the next digit at the start of the line and deletes to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now I want to do it again, I press down, I'll just press dot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I'm removing everything that's not a chapter header. So that's pretty interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I could just delete to the end of the line with D shift G and delete the first line,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm just about done, right? Of course, there's more than one way to do it. So let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">look at a few different ways. Another way we could do it is we could delete all the lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that start with a hyphen. So there's a really useful EX command, which is the command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">G. G is, I think it stands for grep, it searches for things, and it does an action</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to anything, any line that it finds. So with any EX command, you first of all have to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what lines do you want to apply it to? And nearly always, you want to apply it to all lines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is percent. So generally speaking, for most EX commands, you'll start with percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you say, what command do you want to run? So I want to run G, which is I'm searching for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">something. And then in EX, the different parts, the kind of the different parameters are generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">separated by slash. So the next thing is, what do you want to search for? I want to search for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">at the start of a line, a hyphen. Okay, and then another slash. Okay, what do you want to do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I can put in any vim command. And so remember the command to delete in vim is D.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is going to search for anything with a hyphen at the start of the line and delete it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. Okay, so we could now do a similar thing to delete all the empty lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So to delete all the empty lines, I would do percent G slash. Okay, I want to do any time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got the start of a line, followed by zero or more spaces, followed by the end of a line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That's an empty line. What do I want to do? Delete it. Okay, so. And then finally, I want to put a dash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">between that first space and the thing after it. So that's a search and replace. So again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we do colon percent to apply some ex command to the whole file. S for search and replace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the slash to put in our different parameters. So first, what are we searching for? A space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what are we replacing it with? Space hyphen space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then enter. And so this will just apply it by default to the first time it finds it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that's like an overview of like why VIM is cool. Like when people say VIM is cool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they're not saying like, oh, you should use it because it's retro and interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They're saying you should use it because it's powerful. And specifically, data scientists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">should learn VIM because this interactive text munging is what we do with input data files and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">output data files all the time. And something we can look at later if we want to is it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">super easy to create macros in VIM, which is where like literally it will just record</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">each button you press. And then you can just rerun that macro. So if you want to rerun the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">same process on six different files, you just run the macro six times. Now, in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to close without saving. So normally if I go colon Q and it says, no, you haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">saved. So it's kind of careful to help you there. It says add exclamation mark to override. So I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">do that Q exclamation mark. Okay. So we can use that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in Jupyter. And so now we're going to fix the problem, which we talked about earlier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is how come our files disappeared? And to fix it, we need to edit prerun.sh. So if I type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">vim prerun.sh. So here we've got this. And the reason that the files disappeared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is that at the start of our script, we typed CD, and that changed to our home directory. And we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">never went back to where we were. And so that meant when it ran Jupyter, it ran it from our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">home directory. This is actually currently showing the contents of our home directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, okay. I want to show you now how we know this by looking at run.sh. I want to switch to editing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">run.sh without saving where I'm up to. And I want to show you a really neat thing in Linux that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">lets you do this, which is control Z. Control Z does something really interesting. It stops the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">process I was running, and it puts it in the background. So if I type jobs, I can see what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">running in the background. Vim is running in the background. I can do anything I like. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">any time I want, I can type fg for foreground, and it comes back to where I was. So I can hit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">control Z, and then I can type vim slash run.sh, which is actually what I was going to show you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the thing that they run for us when we start an instance. And you can see here it runs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">our script, and then it runs Jupyter. So our script was CDing to our home directory, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">running Jupyter. And so Jupyter was in our home directory when it ran. So I go to colon queue to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">exit that, and I'll go fg. There we go. Now, optional power user thing, which I use a lot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is I would not -- that's not how personally I would have looked at the run.sh file. To look at the run.sh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">file, what I would do in Vim was I would type colon sp, which stands for split, slash run.sh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you can see, vim actually allows me to have multiple windows open at once. Okay. Kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tmux, actually. tmux and vim has very similar functionality. And so then I can, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">scroll around here. And then in vim, instead of pressing control B and an arrow to go to a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">window, which is tmux, in vim it's control W. So except that control W closes a tab in Chrome,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so that's possibly not going to work. Okay. So there's a couple of ways we could solve this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The probably the best way in a script is to use that trick I showed you last time, push D.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Tilde is our home directory. So that's the same as CD, changes to our home directory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but it remembers where we were. And then pop D puts us back to where we were before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that should fix our problem. Okay.

That is very good. That took me back to a previous life where I used to install</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">WordPerfect on Unix boxes and is working in a legal firm and said, what do you use for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">word processor today before I put on WordPerfect? And this person, you know, legal secretary said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I use VI, which is like, vim is VI improved or VI improved. But it's just amazing, the power of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if you know everything it can do, it's a perfect word processor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's great. I mean, I don't use it as a word processor, to be clear. I use, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Microsoft Word or Google Docs as a word processor, because I think they're very good word processes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But for a text editor, I use it a lot. If I've got, you know, a CSV file, I, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">want to do some quick cleanup to or something like that. Or a log file. I'll use it. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty much any time I'm editing a quick script or something on a terminal. It's that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I will say Visual Studio Code is also excellent. And I wouldn't say like vim is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">better or worse than Visual Studio Code. I use both of them. I use vim more often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">than Visual Studio Code, but I do use both of them. And in fact, there is a button here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought somewhere. I thought there was like an open Visual Studio Code button,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but maybe I'm imagining things. Or maybe it has to wait until it's finished opening the server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, here it is. Yeah. So there's an access remote kernel actually lets you connect Visual Studio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">on your machine to the remote machine. So you can even use Visual Studio remotely. You can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">use it in WSL on Windows. Don't install Visual Studio Code into the Linux box, install it into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the Windows box, because it's got a WSL connector built in. So it uses it treats WSL, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just as if it's a local Windows directory. You can also connect to any SSH instance using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">VS Code remote connector or yeah, this remote kernel thing. So, you know, you showed a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of keyboard shortcuts for them, right? So how can someone approach learning it? Because it feels a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bit intimidating when you're a beginner. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, the trick with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">learning something new is to try and like do it in small chunks, right? So don't expect to learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all of them. Like, so at this point, I would say learn I just start inserting things, arrow keys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to move around, escape to go back to command mode, colon WQ to close and save. And at that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you can now use Vim to edit your shell scripts and stuff. And then like try and learn maybe one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2002" target="_blank">00:33:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or two new commands each day. So, you know, one useful one, you know, or emotion each day. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, W and B are useful to know to move forward and backward a word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, there's a lot of Vim tutorials and things out there. So, for example, here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenVim.com, which is going to introduce you by saying, oh, hit the enter key. Like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll hit the enter key. And so you could work through a tutorial like this. Yeah, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we all get intimidated, honestly, Kurian, when we see an expert working with something that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know yet. And at first, it's like, wow, that's powerful. I wish I could do that. But my god,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, how would I ever get to that point? And the goal is not to be an expert at Vim. The goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is to like be able to do Vim to like slowly do something that you want to be able to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is one of the things I, you know, really had to practice to myself in my late teens and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">early 20s was to repeatedly put myself in a position where I was intentionally doing things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">slowly by using a tool that I wanted to know. And I was pretty sure at some point would be useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but I didn't know well enough to do it faster than with other than some other tool. So I've always,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, since since like 16 been pretty good at using Lotus one, two, three and Excel spreadsheets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I tended to turn to them for everything. And then I wanted to learn SQL databases. So I kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of forced myself to do things involving lists with databases for a while, even though I got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">slower. And then I was like, okay, well, I'm going to stop using, you know, I got to start doing more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff with VBA macros and stop doing stuff manually. And again, it was kind of slower for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And particularly like, you know, things like cleaning up that YouTube timestamp thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I could have done that manually, you know, and the first 10 times it would be faster to do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2129" target="_blank">00:35:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">manually. But don't do it manually, right? Because each time you do it manually, you know, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">missing out on the opportunity to get better at the thing that's going to make you faster. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">thing about practicing what you think might eventually be the fast way is that those fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">ways accumulate together in kind of these multiplicative ways. And so, you know, I've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of using this approach of always trying to do things the way I suspect would be the fastest if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I was an expert at it. I've been doing that for like 30 years. And now, most people who watch me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">work go, wow, you're very fast at doing stuff. You must be really smart. You know, I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">no, I'm not really smart. Like, you should have seen me when I started. I was terrible. But now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">these things have all accumulated, right? So, yeah. And if anybody finds, you know, good tutorials,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">let me know. Honestly, it's been a long time since I've run a VIM tutorial. So I don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if this one's good or bad. This is the first one that came up in Google. But the VIM tutorial is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">good. The best tutorial is on Linux in the terminal. If you just type in VIM tutorial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the terminal, it should pop up a very nice tutorial. And I just wanted to say, Jeremy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a few minutes of speech that you just gave. It was absolutely wonderful and very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2216" target="_blank">00:36:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">useful. Okay, yeah. So here is what happens if you type VIM tutor. And it will teach you exiting VIM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So lesson one, moving the cursor, lesson two, exiting VIM. So that's a good start. Make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">caps lock is not depressed. Impress J enough times so that lesson 1.1 fills the screen. J,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">J, J, J, J. Okay. So because the VIM tutor is in VIM, it forces you to use VIM, which is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the nice thing about this is, you know, move the cursor to the line below marked blah, blah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">blah. Here it is. Fix the errors. Move the cursor. Okay. So here's a useful one to know. X to cross</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">out something. So X. There we go. Thanks for that reminder. And the first time you do, you go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">through the VIM tutor, it will feel overwhelming. It did to me only after, you know, on like third,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">fourth try, does it start to make sense and are able to complete the entire thing. But also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when I was learning the basics of VIM, I realized that it has a steep learning curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I like to make things appealing, attractive, and simple for me. So I think Dimitri also mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this in the chat here a second ago. There is a game called VIM Adventures, which is in your browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's another way that you can get exposed to them. That's how I learned it. So I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">dive into a call when I had my corporate job. And instead of, you know, whatever people do on calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which is just, I don't know, browser edit, I would do this. And that was my time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Now I just tried pressing the arrow keys and VIM to see what the VIM Adventures,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and it says, don't use the arrow keys. I don't agree with that, by the way. A lot of people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">overly purists about, like, you have to do things the VIM way. So, okay, yes, you can use H, J, K,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and L. But seriously, it doesn't matter. Anyway. By the way, I see there's actually just a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">things in the Zoom chat. If you can, please say it out loud. There's a couple of reasons why. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">first is I really enjoy social interaction. Otherwise, I'm kind of sitting in my little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">office, you know. And then the second is, of course, for the video, people can hear the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2375" target="_blank">00:39:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">questions. Now, I know sometimes people just can't really talk because they're in some environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they can't do it. In that case, if you see somebody asking something in the chat, could you say, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Mike M asked, what key are you pressing to undo, Jeremy? Rather than just answering it in the chat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and that way I could, like, say that anyway. It looks like, so, yes, somebody said, how did you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">do undo? So, the answer is you to undo. Can I suggest one last resource that is quite amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for VIM? It's the VIM book, editing at the speed of light. Editing, I don't know that one. Speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Speed of thought? Of thought, yes, yes, yes. Practical VIM. That's really, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">really well written. And there's a similar book for tmux. So, that's how I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">start the books that made the really big difference for me. Now, let me tell you something not to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">which is don't install lots of plugins. There's lots of plugins you can install.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, after using VIM for well over 20 years, I don't use any plugins at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not to say that there are none that are any use. But, like, they're not that useful, honestly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can get lost in that whole, like, customizing things thing. And I just wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to make it clear to say, like, actually, out of the box VIM works extremely well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2469" target="_blank">00:41:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, having said that, I customize it using a VMRC. So, an RC file in Linux and stuff is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the normal kind of suffix for configuration files. And I do do some customization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. And I actually put all my configuration files in a GitHub repository.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Or .files. And you'll see here there's a VMRC. But it's only 99 lines. And there's things like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, remember, I mentioned that you can jump to the next -- you can jump around Windows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2514" target="_blank">00:41:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">by pressing Ctrl + W. I made it so you can also press backslash W and backslash up and backslash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">down. So, just really minor things like that. And also some little things like -- oh, I guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I do have some things installed. I don't use them anymore. Also some things like Python syntax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">highlighting. And also, to be able to see things clearly when you've got a black background with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">light text, you have to say set background equals dark. So, I don't know. Little things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes with some nice defaults. You can just actually do this source command to get some nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">defaults. >> Quick question, please.

What are your thoughts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about Visual Studio Code to edit files? >> They're great. I just talked about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I said it's really good. Yep. I like Visual Studio Code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Hi, Jeremy. Do you suggest using Vim key bindings for Jupyter and VS Code as well?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I don't. Because I find it's not about the key bindings. It's about the numbers and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">motions and the dots and the macros and like that stuff. And I don't find that there are other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">editors that Vim as well as Vim do. So, when I use VS Code, I rather, you know, like fully inhabit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the VS Code world. And so, I use the normal VS Code key bindings and try to learn to use VS Code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as I can. So, yeah, I don't do that. Sometimes I've tried. And I'm always disappointed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's always like, yeah, it's not really. So, VS Code is great at being VS Code. And I would use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for editing a big markdown file maybe. I don't use it much. But I guess if I was working with HTML</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or CSS or something, I feel like the way it kind of handles those kind of file formats is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">nice. You can set up Vim to be really nice as well. But VS Code works a bit better, more out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the box, I suppose. Yeah, and also for like navigating through a large repository, VS Code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">can be a bit easier to use maybe. To ask whether you could use a fairly large project with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple files and whether it was doable via Vim. Yeah, it's definitely doable via Vim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2706" target="_blank">00:45:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, we can take a look if you're interested. So, yeah, let's take a look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, it is useful to know how to do this. So, let's take, for example, the fast AI repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, let's clone it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, let's do it all in paper space. Now, in paper space,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the /notebooks directory is persistent across machines. So, it probably makes sense to clone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this into the /notebooks directory. So, if I open up my terminal, so it's persistent within a machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's persistent across restart. So, if I get clone here, it'll still be on this machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Next time I open it, because that's what /notebooks is. It's persistent across restarts on one machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Quick question, Jeremy. Yeah, actually, just before you do, I'm just going to cancel this and mention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">some a little shortcut if that's okay. Did you see that was taking a really long time to clone?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why is it's cloning every single version of fast AI that's ever existed. And since I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">need every single version, if you type --depth1, it'll just give you the most recent version that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">will save some time. So, yeah. So, go ahead. One of the other scripts you had, you were bringing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in /notebooks from storage, like storage somewhere. Is that a change? Yeah, I didn't really understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2811" target="_blank">00:46:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how /notebooks persistence worked at that point. I hadn't spent enough time reading the docs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So, let's pretend that never happened. Okay. So, now that I've cloned this into /notebooks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see it's appeared, right? Because this is where Jupyter is running from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, fast AI is what's called an nb-dev project, which means it's all developed in notebooks. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">these are the notebooks which create fast AI. And then those all get exported as Python modules</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">into here. It's not a very interesting one. And as you can see, it says, "Oh, don't edit me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Edit the notebook." That's fine. Okay. Now, if you want to explore through a code base,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2865" target="_blank">00:47:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's really helpful to be able to, like, click on symbols and jump to their definitions and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">jump back again to kind of see how it all works. And so, you can actually do that on GitHub,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way. I don't know if you've noticed this, but it's quite neat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to detach, if I click on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, it's interesting. It doesn't know how to find that one. It's not perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That one's actually from PyTorch. That must be something it knows how to find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">What about this one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">A popular model, maybe?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's a popular model. Okay. Well, this is very strange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">In theory, it would. Finally, it found one. Okay. So, one problem with doing it in GitHub is it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">not particularly good at it.

So, that's indexed the current folder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3232" target="_blank">00:53:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's created. I expected it to create a file called C tags. I wonder if it's changed how this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">works.

The key thing to know is now we can jump straight to a tag. So, for example, if we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">open up the array mask, whatever file defines array mask and put it in the right place, I can type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">vim minus t for vim jump to a tag and type array mask and that will jump straight to the definition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, that's one way to do it. Another way to do it would be, let's say we were looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at something else like layers.py, is you can type tag jump and then type ar tab and then it'll list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3306" target="_blank">00:55:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all the things that match and then I can hit enter and that will jump to that tag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that you can do is you can notice, for example, this is inheriting from array image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">base to jump to the definition of array image base. It's control right square bracket and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when I hit that, it jumps to that definition and then to go back to the previous tag, it's control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3336" target="_blank">00:55:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">t for tag. Okay. So, they're the key ways to jump around. Okay. So, for example, if we wanted to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">out some tabular class, I could go tab, tag jump, now start typing tabular and hit tab and here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">my various tabular classes. Go to tabular colab. Okay. So, tabular colab is defined in two places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's annoying. One is it's in an ipy check points, which is the backups. So, this is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you would actually create a c tags config file telling it to ignore anything inside ipy'd nb</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3375" target="_blank">00:56:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">check points because you never want to go to the backup version. So, for now, it's confused about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsa2VawOeM&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which one I want.
