And one of the reasons, so the basic idea is we're going to tax land, let's say, rather than taxing real estate values. It doesn't create the same disincentive to build that a real estate tax does.</p><p>A real estate tax says, "Oh, you know what? I might want to keep this thing as a parking lot for a couple of years so I don't have to pay taxes on it." If it were a land value tax, you're going to pay the same tax whether or not it's a parking lot or whether or not you're going to put a high-rise on it, so you might as well put the high-rise on it and we could use the space.</p><p>Where George got it wrong is the idea that a land value tax is going to solve all the problems of society or all the problems of cities is ludicrously not true. At the national level, it's not a particularly progressive tax in lots of ways. It would be hard to figure out how to fund all the things you want to fund, especially since there are lots of things that we do that are not very land-intensive.</p><p>I think George was imagining a world in which pretty much all value-creating enterprises had a lot of land engaged. So a good idea? Yes. A panacea?</p></div></div></body></html>
