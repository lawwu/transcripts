target="_blank">00:01:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So jealousy itself can be expressed positively as a joyful desire for the affections of the beloved,</span></div><div class="c"><span

be good, a proper emotion in the heart of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.500</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:02:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Paul, in 1 Corinthians 10, 22, warns Christians, "Don't provoke the Lord to jealousy."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, don't give your heart away to anybody but Him when it belongs to Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's jealousy for the

Numbers 25, 11 for being jealous with his jealousy, jealous with God's jealousy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, it's right for us to feel with God a jealousy that He get the affections from us and from others that belong to Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There should be a joy within us when affections are flowing to God which belong to God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and there should be indignation in us when affections that belong to God are flowing to something other than God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's jealousy. It's good jealousy that we share with God. We have His jealousy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when it comes to jealousy among people, to each other, the New Testament is clear that there's a good kind and a bad kind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The New Testament has lots of warnings against the bad kind, the sin of jealousy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But the very word translated "jealousy," the noun "jealousy," can also be translated as "zeal" in a good way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">"Zeal for your houses consumed me." That's a good thing, a good kind of jealousy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the difference is not in the word that's used, it's in the context, in the way it's used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbQEw-4YFgc&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13:4, "Love is not jealous."
