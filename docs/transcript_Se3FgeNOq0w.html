Most of it is complete garbage. And the more advice you take, the less well-informed you actually are. This is something that's counterintuitive. You think like, oh, I'm just starting out in my life, I need to go and get tons of advice from all these different people.</p><p>And the reality is that for them, most of their maps that they're going to provide you with, the advice that they provide you being the map, are not going to match the terrain of your life. Your life is fundamentally very different than whatever it is you're going to encounter.</p><p>Nassim Taleb talks about this idea of the noise bottleneck in some of his work, which basically says that you assume that by consuming more, you're going to get more signal as a result. But the reality is that by consuming more, and in this case, consuming more advice, the ratio of noise to signal actually increases over time.</p><p>so what you're left with is a worse idea of what the overall answer is.</p></div></div></body></html>
