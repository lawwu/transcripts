I want to say there's four tiers of pools. There's like the adult pool and then three tiers of kids' pools with little waterfalls between them with rocks that kids can jump off of, weird little water features and multiple hot tubs, shallow section for younger kids.</p><p>It was definitely more of a family vibe than some hotels I've stayed at, but we were there with our kids, so that was exactly what we were looking for. And this was also true at the Four Seasons, but like you never felt like there weren't chairs. At the montage, they told us explicitly they had this policy.</p><p>You could go down seven o'clock, you could sit in chairs, and if you don't use them by nine o'clock, you lose them. I appreciated that they had a policy that was stated, but because there were not so many people there when we were there, at least they had enough chairs for people.</p></div></div></body></html>
