So there has to be some sort of balance between looking at this number in my portfolio and the, the number is the only thing that matters and this, these are the goalposts versus having a more balanced life, there's things that happen in your life that can change how you view that saving stuff and obviously everyone's different.</p><p>Some people have a problem spending too much money. Some people save too much. Some people are in the middle. I've tried to bring my financial life more in balance to think of a wealthy life, more as enjoying some of it now, while still making sure future me is going to be sad.</p><p>We've had clients in our wealth management firm who plan their whole life and they get to the point where it's retirement time and they dropped out of a deadly disease, right, right. As they're about to finally enjoy their money. having those kind of experiences has shaped and changed me.</p></div></div></body></html>
