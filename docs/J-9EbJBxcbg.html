href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of talk to you about cypher and some of the things that you'll be seeing and then we'll go ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and get hands-on

talk about creating a graph we'll start with some structured data here just to keep things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">simple i'll introduce on structured data a little bit later some basic cipher queries some algorithms</span></div><div class="c"><span

graph basically when we think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">about it a knowledge graph generally is devont is defined as some design patterns to organize and access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">interrelated data and at neo4j we model the data inside of the database is what's called a property graph</span></div><div class="c"><span

are like your nouns these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">your

target="_blank">00:12:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">together hence the name and often will be like verbs so person knows person person lives with person</span></div><div class="c"><span

have properties which are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.580</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">as well so we can store vectors for we've had for a long time inside of neo4j and you can do search over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">these things now the query language that we're going to use to access the database is called cipher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and i know a lot of you raised your hands in the beginning so you already have some familiarity with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but cipher kind of looks like ascii text so the idea right is that it has this sqls kind of feel to it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but you get to write these statements like if you see match person knows skill basically you're connecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a person node to a skills node through that nose relationship so it reads kind of very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">literally in the way that it's written nodes have what's called labels which is sort of like it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">be the equivalent of a type of table within a sql database of basically what type of entity it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and then as i said before they have properties so for example you can identify by a property like name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can have variables like p and s which refer to the actual entity as you start to write your query</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">more so this is not going to be a course on writing cipher right because we can make an 80 minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">course just on like how are we going to make cipher queries um but we'll be walking through these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">queries so don't expect to like be if you haven't seen cipher before to be a super expert in the cipher</span></div><div class="c"><span

want to know and basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm going

with this is that once we have this logic extracted from whatever our original data source</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is we can now control at a much more fine-tuned level how we define what a similar person is or what a</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll get a lot of stuff back because now we're looking at people and all the other

here and find the most central skills among these people right like for example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1742"

similar skills to lucy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and in here it's just some examples of running that same logic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.620</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1944" target="_blank">00:32:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">over is basically just running these queries um returning in this case the distinct is important to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">return a distinct name because you might actually get to the same person multiple times um so if you're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">returning a name in a and um of a skill right then it's important to um to to use distinct in that case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">so we get all the distinct skills that basically showed up in the graph we were just looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">another thing

then we can match um basically from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.340</a></span> | <span

of shared skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">um between between

of look for similar skill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">sets a lot we can create a similar skill relationship inside of our graph so basically we can match two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2055"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">technically a programming language although a lot of people don't love it i love r um aws like they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">very short right so having descriptions about those uh skill names if you embed those it provides a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">informative embedding right so that's the whole idea there so basically we give each skill a description</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2726" target="_blank">00:45:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we embed that description and what we're seeing inside of this is we're actually going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and these are all text embedding ada so they're so they're 1536</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:45:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">i think we create our vector index down here that we call the skills embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

we'll get that skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">embedding index is we're now going to be able to do vector search on skills inside of the graph so if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">i have python as a skill and i go ahead and i'll use this command in cypher to search the skills embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">pull back the 10 most relevant skills and you'll see here it'll it'll bring some skills back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">here it's like ruby and java we got pandas at least that's good django pytorch so some of these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2790" target="_blank">00:46:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">better than others but the point is that we can go ahead and apply these vectors and then pull information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2796" target="_blank">00:46:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">back with vector search and another interesting thing that we can do um as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">is we can if i had something that wasn't in the database like say i'm just looking for api coding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">right and i searched that as a term basically what i'm doing here is i'm using the open ai</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">client here to just embed this model or i might be using actually laying chain up here looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it's laying chain and then i'm doing a search on the database to pull back relevant skills with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2827" target="_blank">00:47:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">certain similarity threshold and i'll get back api design and javascript for that api coding example</span></div><div class="c"><span

ability to do semantic similarity in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.540</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2851" target="_blank">00:47:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that um so there's some advantages to doing this but a big one is visualization and also clustering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">so if i were to take this command which takes a semantic similar semantic relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and i go into my graph and i just put that in here and i just return all basically the skills that are</span></div><div class="c"><span

so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">i'll start to see for example that

i've got like all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">front-end you

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like overlap with similar skill sets like that might be a case where it actually

target="_blank">00:51:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">a balance between the semantic similarity and sort of a hard overlap of skills and then you can use</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and basically the way that you can do this and if you've already done some entity extraction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=3368" target="_blank">00:56:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you're probably already

target="_blank">00:56:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of pedantic classes so here basically i'm going to define my person with a name and an email</span></div><div class="c"><span

add relationship properties you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">would

target="_blank">00:56:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">also have like a proficiency property in which place this would be a list of you know nose skills</span></div><div class="c"><span

can see this is a very simple example so all we're doing here is we're defining a list of skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=3415"

those two people so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=3445" target="_blank">00:57:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we had two

someone knows it's very simple right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=3975" target="_blank">01:06:15.500</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:06:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">going to pull um actually this one is searching for people with skills i apologize so in this one the</span></div><div class="c"><span

that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the person's similarity there's a

target="_blank">01:07:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that a lot towards the beginning we can do it by community so we can look for people that know different</span></div><div class="c"><span

can look for all the skills that those people know and basically what we're doing at that point is we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">looking for people inside of the same uh skills uh community um but the other way that you can do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4073" target="_blank">01:07:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">is um you can look for similar skill sets um using the uh similar skill set relationships so the hard-coded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship that we've made from before uh which basically looks at hey how many how what's the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span

some answers here between so we were looking at john garcia and we're saying hey find similar people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4100" target="_blank">01:08:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we can get like a score count of overlap um to the to the different people here and then we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4107" target="_blank">01:08:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">start adding in

target="_blank">01:08:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">actually doing is it's sort of balancing between the um similar skill set and semantically similar skill</span></div><div class="c"><span

um and then from there we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a

because this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">this is kind of a big

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4387" target="_blank">01:13:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to power bi and data visualization um it'll go through and choose the uh appropriate um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4394" target="_blank">01:13:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you know the the appropriate tool for the job so in this case uh find similar skills it'll pull those back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4404" target="_blank">01:13:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and you'll see going down right if i said well what person has similar skills to you know this other</span></div><div class="c"><span

go ahead and use that specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">tool so in this case what we're doing is we're providing a bunch of tools that are presumably expert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4421" target="_blank">01:13:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">tools that we can give to the model and then it will know that okay i have to go ahead and pull those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4427" target="_blank">01:13:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">those specific tools to be able to provide a response and then there's a little app down here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4433" target="_blank">01:13:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">as well if you

target="_blank">01:14:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but basically if i ran that i can go ahead and come in here and then i can have a little conversation with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4449" target="_blank">01:14:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it so this is very small but what skills are similar you know i can go ahead and ask it in here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4457" target="_blank">01:14:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and then provided everything's working it'll go ahead and choose the appropriate tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4463" target="_blank">01:14:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and then i can say well who knows you know maybe i'll just say those skills and it should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4472" target="_blank">01:14:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">go ahead and pull the appropriate tool to be able to find out who knows all these different skills right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4481" target="_blank">01:14:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and if i go back to my uh to my example here i should see the query logic that it used so first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4488" target="_blank">01:14:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you know it said find similar skills to what i just mentioned because i asked about power bi</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9EbJBxcbg&t=4494" target="_blank">01:14:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and then after that i asked about people who know skills so it said find persons
