You can often find better deals by flying to different airports and you might have to then book another short distance flight, let's say, to get to where you really want to end up ultimately. The more you do searches, the more you're going to want that capability to put in multiple airports.</p><p>My wife and I were going to Japan. We really wanted to do it in business. From Portland, the flights were in business were like one quarter of the cost on the kind of range of dates we wanted as they were from San Francisco. It was like 100,000 something round trip from Portland and like 400,000 round trip in San Francisco.</p><p>And the flight to Portland was like $100 each way. $200 plus, you know, 100,000 points is infinitely better than spending 100,000 points.</p></div></div></body></html>
