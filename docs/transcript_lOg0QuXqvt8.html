People always wish they spent more time with their family and friends. Like it's such a joke, but it's like nobody thinks the house is going to burn down when they buy insurance.</p><p>We're terrible long-term planners. People are terrible at saving money because nobody thinks they're going to need it until it's too late. We have to talk to people in the here and now, right? Let's get them where they are. Are you the happiest you can be? Do you feel like you've got someone who's got your back?</p><p>Do you feel like you can call someone when you're not doing well and that they have the skill set to know how to hold space? Do you ever get people to call to brag about how freaking amazing you are and they share in the joy with you and big up you and make you feel even better?</p><p>Or do you have to keep it to yourself because you're kind of embarrassed that you're going to be that guy to your friends? Just ask yourself these questions if you have any of these people in your life. And if the answer is no to any of them, then maybe a little work is required.</p></div></div></body></html>
