actually like um um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">broadly speaking they divided um intelligence in three different um they wanted to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=177"

actually the last part of the knowledge series of from those researchers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so in this edition they act um they actually explore the knowledge capacity laws and scaling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

are addressing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in this part is that so

lack of understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of precise

so if we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">understand this in

target="_blank">00:05:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">understand that in a language model how much knowledge is stored per parameter and what kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

they don't like give us very granular understanding of okay so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what what does it mean perfect perplexity score of 3.2 or something can it like if I give it a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember correctly what how they tested or evaluated was that so there was this like base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">biosynthetic data set of the biography that was like plain sentences.

So if the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">data set was like my name is that and I was born there a corresponding question answer or yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">question answer data set from that from that bio would be that who is Ania Fojer and where was she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywYjTbdR1XA&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">born or where did she study.
