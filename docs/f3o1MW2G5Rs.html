But let's start with money. This week in the New York Times, he said that his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">grand idea is that OpenAI will capture much of the world's wealth through the creation of AGI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and then redistribute this wealth to the people. And yes, he mentioned several figures,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">$100 billion, $1 trillion, even $100 trillion.

That's not to say that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">would become that rich. The Wall Street Journal this week reported that he has no direct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">financial stake in the business.

So where does he want all the money to go? Well, he seems to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">two main ideas, plus a third one that I'll touch on at the end. His first idea is UBI, or Universal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Basic Income. We also have funded the largest and most comprehensive universal basic income study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">sponsored by OpenAI. And I think it's like an area we should just be looking into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">How exactly would that work? Well, he laid out his theory in this blog post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And he began it with this. He says he's reminded every day about the magnitude of socioeconomic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">change that is coming sooner than most people believe. He said that the price of many kinds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of labor, which drives the costs of goods and services, will fall towards zero once sufficiently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful AI joins the workforce. He said that that was great for people buying products,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">but not so much for those working to earn a wage. So where would their money come from? He proposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">something called the American Equity Fund. It would be capitalized by taxing companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that are above a certain valuation, 2.5% of their market value each year. And it would also be funded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">by taxing 2.5% of the value of all privately held land. By his calculation, that will be worth around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">$13,500 in about 2030. And he said that that money would have much greater purchasing power than it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">does now, because technology would have greatly reduced the cost of goods and services. It does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">raise the question for me, though, about those countries that aren't the home of massive AI companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">where are they going to get the wealth from? On Lex Friedman's podcast, he admitted it wasn't a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">full solution. I think it is a component of something we should pursue. It is not a full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">solution. I think people work for lots of reasons besides money. He thinks much more will be needed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">because the cost of intelligence could fall to almost zero. My basic model of the next decade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is that the marginal cost of intelligence and the marginal cost of energy are going to trend rapidly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">towards zero, like surprisingly far. So what is his other main idea? Simply use the money to fund</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the economy. Even with these two ideas, he admits there's still a big problem. As he put it recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he sees a lot of people who are not going to be able to afford to pay for their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">services.

OpenAI itself released this paper around 10 days ago. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">calculated that with access to a large language model, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But crucially, when incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to around 50% of all tasks. That is a colossal impact for better or worse just with GPT-4 plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">software. On page 17 of the paper, it had this table, which I think captures a lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting analysis. Let me briefly explain what it shows. We have a column of example occupations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">in the middle and the education that is required for each of them and the job preparation. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things on the right are where it gets interesting. These are the percentages of exposure graded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">alpha, beta and zeta. The human assessment of exposure is titled H and the M is for the machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">assessment. They actually got GPT-4 to do an assessment too. Notice that for the most part, GPT-4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">agrees with the human assessors. So what are these three grades? Alpha is the proportion of tasks in these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">occupations affected by current language models alone without any further advances or integrations. Beta represents the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">percentage of tasks exposed in a realistic scenario of language models plus a bit of software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">integration and a few advances. You could think of it as their median prediction. Finally, zeta is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">bit like their most extreme scenario with full adoption of software plus advances of LLMs. By the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">way, we're not talking GPT-5 here or text-to-video, just basic software integration like a longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">context window or text-to-image. The trend that immediately stuck out for me was how when you go up the educational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">levels and the salary ranges, the effect of these large language models on task exposure goes up and up and up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">until you reach master's degree or higher levels. Then it seems to dip down a little. Maybe this is why Sam Altman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">predicted inequality. The people on the very cutting edge of science would still get paid well, probably better than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">ever, but there may be a further hollowing out of the middle class with working class occupations left largely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">untouched. The paper also touches on why so few people might be currently focused on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">language models. I don't know about you, but have you noticed that feeling where it seems to be us being super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in this technology with most people not being that interested? Well, here might be one reason why. Currently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">only 3% of US workers have over half of their tasks exposed to LLMs. But that's only when considering existing language and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">code capabilities without additional software or modalities. So not that many people are seeing a massive change in their work. But it says that when we account for other general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">generative models and complementary technologies, our human estimates indicate that up to 49% of workers could have half or more of their tasks exposed to LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether this means doubling the amount of work done or halving the number of workers doing it, I'll talk more about later in the video. But maybe this was the dramatic economic impact that Ilya Satskova once predicted on Lex Friedman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think is the bar for impressing us?
