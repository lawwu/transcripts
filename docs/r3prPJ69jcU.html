I don't think people know the story. I wanted to ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how did you become the senior pastor of Grace Point? Because a lot of people have this impression</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that you founded the church and all this stuff.

You know, that's not as straightforward as it should be. We're a 40-year-old church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">in some way. Yeah. Because it's in Berkeley where it all started. And current expression of Grace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Point is from that period. That's true. In 1981, when I was a freshman, this church started as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Berkeley Baptist Church. Berkeley and Oakland, Berkeley Baptist Church. I was a freshman in 81.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The church started in 81. But I didn't join until 88. Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">January of 88. We were recently married, 87. And we decided that, you know, we went to a Korean church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we decided, well, we need better discipleship. We need people to mentor us. And I had known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the leaders and my friends at Berkeley and had lots of admiration for the church. I was involved in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">youth ministry. And so I felt really obligated. I started it as a college and it just continued.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we joined the church in 88. It's getting long already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, no. It's good. It's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah. So then, yeah, so I was working as a corporate lawyer in San Francisco on a big farm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Kelly was a coder before coders became really cool, working for Sun Microsystems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why we lived in Alameda. We're the only ones living in Alameda because she had a commute down to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the South Bay. And so, and we're just lay leaders. And one day I looked at what I was doing at the law</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">firm. And like, I had this moment, I was representing clients like Pechtoll and Kaiser. They really didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">need little Ed Kang working on their stuff. Whereas back at church, you know, and that was right when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we were shifting into all, all English. Oh yeah. Okay. Right around we weren't 88. No, we were a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Korean, Korean speaking, Korean culture Baptist church. I don't actually know we spoke Korean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So no, it was, it was exclusively Korean speaking. We're a Korean speaking church. And then, um, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">when we joined in 88, uh, actually correct that we were still largely a Korean speaking church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. But we had started an English speaking ministry, which I think by like 1990 became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">completely exclusively English speaking, but we're always a collegiate church. So, um, so anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">so we joined in 88, uh, we started, um, teaching Bible and, you know, right around in a couple of years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so I guess it was in 93 when, when I finally decided to, uh, leave law and do, do this full time. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you know, my own calling story is very different from your typical, like, how did God call you into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">ministry? And there's a certain story, uh, that you're supposed to have of like strong impression</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">or, or something like that. And I never heard a voice or there, there was nothing like that. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">what it was, was I kind of looked around and, um, I was the leader, you know, like somebody's got to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">lead this thing. We're, we're, we're a poor, my first salary was $200 a month. We're a poor church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So everybody was bivocational. Cause if you're in collegiate ministry, that's what you're going to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. So you had a, you had a friend who said something to you, I think that kind of triggered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the thought, right? The thing about, Oh yes. I had a really good friend who is a pastor in New York</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">right now. Uh, Danny Lee. And, uh, Danny said to me one day, and he was an engineer, uh, but he would,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">he would say these like provocative things to me. Uh, and, um, he said, Hey, um, if you became a pastor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and I became a pastor and all of our friends became pastors, cause we're all like lay ministers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Kind of loving on younger brothers, uh, best as we could with our day jobs. He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that still wouldn't be enough pastors. I said, I said, yeah, you're right. Uh, and I think the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that we were looking at, it's, it's not like America. It's certainly not the world. What we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at is this growing group of English speaking, American born second generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And at that point it was Koreans. And we looked around and none of us, and by us, I mean, English</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking, uh, older ones, and we were rare. Like most of my friends were way more comfortable in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Korean. So Danny and I were, we're sort of the rare breeds. And he said, if all of us became pastors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that wouldn't be enough. Meaning there, there, there's so many of these, um, Korean, you know, kids</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can, kids, younger brothers. And so I said, no, that wouldn't be enough. And he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, then why aren't we doing it? And my only answer was the salary, man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, I worked hard for this job, went to law school, you know? Um, so that really convicted me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so it was 93. I became, uh, a full time. And when did he go full time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">He went full time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Years later, he held up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">He said that and then he like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a good friend, he made you two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It was interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. Maybe I was an older brother that he looked up to because then he quit his, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering job, became a lawyer.

I was thinking about it. It was such a relief when she said that it became very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">clear. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. So, uh, back to your question. So I was leading the ministry at Berkeley,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the college. Uh, we had another bro, a friend of mine leading the, what we now call praxis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the post-college back then were a lot more college heavy. And then anybody who graduated college,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">they would get, they would become college staff or they would go and become praxis. And because it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">led by someone else and the relationship was with us, then it was, um, it, I think a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">felt that as a rejection, like you didn't make the cut, you know? And so that was unhappy for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It was definitely unhappy for my friend who's leading this ministry. And people come and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, please pray for me. I'm bitter that I couldn't make it on college team. And he's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">what, what am I? Uh, he, he eventually went on to plant a church in San Jose and LA, uh, leaving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, the whole Berkeley church to me. Uh, and then, um, I guess, uh, the Berkeley-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that time you were leading the English college, the praxis and Korean? Was the Korean still around?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Well, that's a whole nother story. So although, although we're a Korean speaking Korean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">church, there was another Korean congregation that had started in the mid nineties, not mid nineties,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">mid, mid eighties. And that was reaching out to, so it's sort of like our international ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">right? They were, they're reaching out to Korean graduate students. And so as we became more English,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">they became the more, more Korean. So then the Korean side of it continued, uh, and, and that was led by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">someone else. So we were kind of maybe two congregations in parallel. Um, unlike a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">immigrant church situations, the English side became more dominant and more financially. Uh, we, and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">eventually got to the point where we were supporting the Korean congregation financially for a while. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah. And then, um, and then 2006, the Berkeley network, um, all sort of became autonomous by mutual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">agreement. Uh, and from an objective church world perspective, it was very civil from an emotional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective. It was like, we were all torn apart, uh, because we had pledged to bury our bones together and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">we're all close friends. And, uh, we had to break up for reasons that, you know, I don't, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily want to go get into, I mean, I don't mind talking about it, but it involves other people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'd rather not. Uh, but it was, uh, it, it started out as a classic church split in a way, uh, because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">um, two churches, three churches, the Davis church, the Berkeley church and the San Jose church. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">because we're at that point, we're a network of about maybe seven churches. Uh, and, uh, we, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">we had some concerns with the overall direction and leadership of the church. And so it was decided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that, uh, instead of fighting that out, that we would just go autonomous in 2006. So that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">have been the 25th anniversary, uh, of the Berkeley movement. And then everybody else took on different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">names. And that's, that's when we took on the name grace point. Got it. Got it. Wow. Yeah. And then we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">we, you know, in, in our other podcasts, we've kind of, the rest is history. We've talked about that a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit, but I think that was really enlightening. That was really helpful. So yeah. Do you want to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Right. And then, so he gave everyone milk jugs full of water and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">they held it out like this.

And, and in ascending order and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and whatnot. So, you know, you know what the phone numbers are. And this particular staff was trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">contact a freshman, invite him out and call his number and couldn't reach him. Right. And so most of us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">would be like, all right, you know, I tried, but this staff being very, you know, zealous starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">calling the neighboring rooms and because it's, you know, ascending order, he knows, right. Calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">calls and I think it was like the fourth door down. He gets someone to pick up and he goes, hi,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't know me, but I'm so-and-so and I'm trying to reach this guy.

So. Well, okay. I guess two questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">about that. Well, first, was that common practice? And if not, yeah. What, what would you tell that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">staff? Gosh, no, that was not common practice. That was, that was not common practice. I, like in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">world, I don't think that was common practice. Um, uh, so. Cause we don't remember the landline days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay. So I know this story and, um, you know, Manny has gone on to become a very, a very fruitful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">leader, you know, since that time. But, um, what, what was troubling to me was this story was circulating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">as a, as an inspiring example of perseverance. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. So then I had to publicly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">throw cold water on this. Okay. The result was that Ender is still here. It was Ender. It was Ender.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm learning so many things. Dark Knight Legion. And so, yeah. So, so it's sort of like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">what to, what to uphold based on the result, but wait, like that result might've been okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">but like, don't do this. Yeah. And don't justify the means. I had no idea that that was Ender. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow. Yep. Yep. Yep. Wow. Okay. All right. Moving on to the second one. Um, okay. So yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">like I said, we're kind of ramping up the, the cringe and the pain, but don't worry. This person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is also still around.

Yeah. Yeah. I think we should do another series. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">why are you still here? Anyway. Um, so this girl came from a fairly, pretty much totally unchurched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">background. Is that right? Um, to pretty much unchurched background. And, um, it was one of her first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">events, like first year. And, um, she got the commitment card, you know, we do commitment cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you know, retreats and things like that, where it's, if you want to become a Christian,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, there's different options.

I want to rededicate. I want to find more about Christianity. And she was a newcomer. She had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">no idea what these options meant. And so she just was like, that was weird. And she didn't fill it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think she like wrote her name on the card and then left it blank, the rest of it blank. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">um, her leader who we do not know who this is. So, so don't worry about that. Um, we've,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we've kept their identity secret, even from us. Um, but her leader pulled her aside,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">took her side into a room and said, said like, Hey, like, you know, just blank, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. She's like, are you ready to become a Christian? She said, Hey, are you ready to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">become a Christian? And this girl said, what are you talking about? Like, I don't even know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">what this means. Like, what is this? And basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">imagine that it's a really high pressure. Yeah. I don't actually know how that resolved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully it just ended right there, but yeah. So pulling aside to the room saying, Hey, are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">ready to become Christian? How come you didn't fill out this card? So, um, I can, I can say with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">fair amount of confidence, I know that that's not common practice anymore, but again, kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">how would you react if, if someone told you this is what they did in the staff meeting or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like that? What would be your response to that? Have you heard of this story? No, I haven't heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it, but you know what? I mean, this sort of thing probably happens a lot. Okay. This sort of thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like over eager. Um, Oh, somebody filled out a card, you know, maybe they meant to check off this box,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, like, wow, I want to, I want to follow up, you know? Uh, half the time that people say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to follow up.

Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I just said something.

So anyway, I think that's a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't like that word follow up. Anyway, I'm getting, I'm going off now. So going back to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that room where you, um, yeah, I think that's low EQ.

Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">but you know, I can tell this, this leader would have felt like, wow, there's something special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">happened.

That's how we get people to sign up volunteers, like the Google form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We send out an interest form saying, Hey, would you be interested in potentially going on a church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">plant? You know, that's how we formed our teams and things. Um, but this particular person talks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">about how after that form went out, they didn't feel ready, didn't fill it out. Uh, and they got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a text saying, Hey, could you come over and could we talk? And their leader invited them to their home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and they had a talk and it wasn't like a rebuke. It wasn't like shouting or anything, but they asked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, how come you didn't sign up? And the person said, uh, I just didn't feel ready. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">know, I don't feel ready at this time to go on a church plant. And the leader basically, uh, said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you know what I think to the effect of, I think you're staying here, uh, out of a desire for comfort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and out of a desire to keep your well-paying job here in the Bay. Um, so can you just react to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">please? Sorry. Okay. So here I am thinking everybody's volunteering, but that's the sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of thing that goes on. Um, I think for the most part, um, the spirit of our church planting is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1669" target="_blank">00:27:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">people do sign up, uh, voluntarily. And, um, and then when the form closes, I get like tons of emails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, I was just still thinking about it. Can you reopen the form? And, um, so I think by and large,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">it is, it is what it seems to be on the surface. Um, but I put in a, you know, I designed those forms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and I, and I put in all these, um, outs, you know, like, um, so like we say, oh, people volunteer, but,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">um, people say, so one of the choices is like, send me out. I'm ready to go. No reservations. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and then another choice is like, um, I'm willing to go as part of my commitment to Christ. So like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, well, that, that, that, that could be, you know, you could, it depends on the tone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">right? That one, like, yeah, I'm willing to go, you know, or yeah, I'm willing to go. And then third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">is like, I have some concerns, but I'm willing to go or, you know, so, and then, and then state your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">concerns. And then those concerns could be job, could be aging parents, could be, you know, like, I really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">try to break into this field and I just got a job. Uh, it wouldn't be a good, good time for me to leave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, so all of those, those reasons are taken seriously into account, especially the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I just got a tech job as English major. I finally got a tech job, like, no, you stay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you stay. Um, you know, like, uh, me and my wife were trying to conceive or in the middle of, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, some kind of treatment around that all know you stay. Uh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">my parents are in and out of the hospital right now and they live in San Jose, like, or they live nearby.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. You stay. So there's, there's a lot of reasons why people like, you know, I, I'm reaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">out to a bunch of students and they're, they're irregular, but they're really coming around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. You stay. Um, we, so anyway, going back to this, like calling somebody in and saying like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, you should, why, why didn't you sign up? Um, like again, they get, I guess it depends on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship. Like, wow. I thought you you're, you're eager to sign up. I'm surprised you didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So it could be that kind of conversation, but then, but then to carry that to a sort of an accusation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's because you want to hold on to your, like, what if that's true? Right. Cause you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you, you kind of think, you know, people. So like, I know you like, you know, okay. What if that's true</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">as a leader to do that? Um, like, I think as a friend to do that, Hey, I thought we're going to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">on a church plant together. Like you just, you just holding onto that job because there are stock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">options like in two years. Right. You know, like friends can accuse each other of that. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">no, shut up. What do you know? Like, because it's an equal relationship. You could, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you could push back, but for, but for a leader to do that, Hey, I feel very uncomfortable about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that should have happened. So back in the days, going back to the altar call,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">people do this a lot. Um, I'm not going to necessarily say it's sister leaders all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to necessarily say that, but, um, so there would be quote unquote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a perfect message for somebody. Yeah. Cause we were talking about it and like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you were struggling with, you know, your source of significance and whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And here was a message, you know, on the Samaritan woman. And as a leader, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm so expecting you to soak that message in and respond, but alas, you know, there's no response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And the, by response, I mean, she didn't come forward. Right. We used to have 40 people come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">forward, uh, and, and everybody gets prayed for. So then the service ends, but it doesn't end until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the last person gets prayed for. Uh, but, but anyway, so all the leaders are eagerly waiting. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, that didn't happen. And then they would follow up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's that word again. And I'm like, no wonder so many people are coming out. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause if you get talked to, even in the sweetest, Oh, did you, what did you think about that? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">because you didn't really respond. Even if that's what happened, what does that do? It ruins all future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">rededication times, all future altar calls because, Oh, now it's about, Oh, is this relevant to me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause then I should come out. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">so that, so then you're ruining it. Right. So, so there's this sort of, you're setting a precedent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you're, you're kind of affecting the fee. So I would, I would say, don't follow up. Don't ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to anybody about why they didn't come forward. Maybe they fell asleep. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I always say, I'm actually a preacher that's very forgiving about people falling asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I am because, because people fall asleep at the wheel and they could die. Right. So it's such a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">comfortable and, you know, like high CO2 levels, people feel sleepy anyway. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that why we got rid of those? Yeah. Cause I remember, I remember those times when we used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">have it every Sunday, but yeah, our freshman year, it still happened every year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. You know, we got rid of it partially because of that, uh, partially because it would,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, just kind of freak out people who are here for the first time. And then there are people in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">front and they're being prayed over. And we kind of pray Korean style full prone where you get on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">hands and knees and pray like this. Yeah. Yeah. It was kind of weird. No, I appreciated some of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">things we did out of consideration for like the non-Christians coming. Cause I, I didn't even know that like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">doing like praise songs could make them feel uncomfortable. Like what is this mass karaoke?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I came from like, I was leading praise and everything.

We think that's the most natural thing. You think about it. Who looks at a screen and sings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">together? Yeah. Nobody does. That's true. Nobody does that. And we think it's the most natural thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of kind of one follow up question from this scenario. So I have heard you at staff meetings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and in public kind of say stuff like this, like don't follow up on things like this. And I've heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">it's opt in, like don't fall. And yet I would say the practice persists. What is your best theory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">about why people keep doing these kinds of things?

You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2438" target="_blank">00:40:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was beyond inartful.

And I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">have had problems with somebody doing that, calling somebody out in public like that. I think I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">have rescued him right away.

Right. So yeah, I guess maybe there's a little bit of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">anyway, yeah, don't.

So it humiliates him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as creating this atmosphere for the next time you share. But even one on one people want,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">quote unquote, vulnerable sharing. And I think that's a signal of, of I'm being trusted. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">think if you're an insecure leader, you want to, you want assurance that you're trusted. And the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you feel trusted is when somebody shares vulnerably.

Right. And, and I think that's something that people maybe don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">appreciate or, or, or understand is, is, is that, um, at multiple levels we are responding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3prPJ69jcU&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, and it's just not sort of like this.
