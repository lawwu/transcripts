So where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1662">00:27:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">does Tesla currently stand on its quest for full autonomy?

Well, on the highway already, the probability of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1678">00:27:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">intervention is extremely low. Yes. So for highway autonomy, with the latest release,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1686">00:28:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">especially the probability of needing to intervene is really quite low. In fact, I'd say for stopping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1692">00:28:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to go traffic, it's far safer than a person right now. The probability of an injury or an impact is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1700">00:28:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">much, much lower for autopilot than a person. And then with navigating autopilot, you can change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1706">00:28:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">lanes, take highway interchanges. And then we're coming at it from the other direction, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1711">00:28:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">low speed, full autonomy. And in a way, this is like, how does a person learn to drive? You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1717">00:28:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">learn to drive in the parking lot.

You learn to drive in the parking lot, get things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1727">00:28:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">right at low speed. And then the missing piece that we're working on is traffic lights and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1735">00:28:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff streets. Stuff streets, I would say actually also relatively easy because you kind of know where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1741">00:29:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the stuff street is, voice casing, geocoders, and then use visualization to see where the line is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1746">00:29:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and stop at the line to eliminate the GPS error. So I'd say there's probably complex traffic lights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1755">00:29:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and very windy roads are the two things that need to get solved. What's harder, perception or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1762">00:29:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">control for these problems? So being able to perfectly perceive everything or figuring out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1768">00:29:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a plan once you perceive everything, how to interact with all the agents in the environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1772">00:29:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in your sense, from a learning perspective, is perception or action harder in that giant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&t=1779">00:29:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">beautiful, multitask learning neural network?
