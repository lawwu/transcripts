So essentially what Ido was doing was revealing to me or allowing me to reveal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to myself the different patterns of movement that are contained in the language of my nervous system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">but that I was unaware of prior to the work with him. Then we moved on to some other sorts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">dynamic movements involving high-level coordination of using feet and hands to stomp on tennis balls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">bounce them up, grab them with the hand that was dictated in the moment by Ido. That was challenging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">at times, to say the least. Other patterns of movement involved an extreme amount of balance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">again, my balance not being terrible, but certainly not being at a high-level skill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and certainly not having done these sorts of moving practices before. I struggled quite a lot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but found that within each movement practice at the point of struggle, there was often a breakthrough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">into getting it or suddenly feeling as if my body could perform the movements, whereas a few moments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">before I couldn't.

What this involved for me was making sure that I did not generate any movements until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the command was delivered and then taking a pause before generating the movement that I was instructed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to do, which at first felt slow and clunky, but clearly led to faster, more accurate execution of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the instructed movement. And the second one was to try and forget the rule as soon as I learned it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">because indeed the rules were changing very quickly. There were many other teachings and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">learnings throughout the day, that is Ido teaching and me attempting to learn, and by the end of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">day, I confess I felt quite differently in my body.

I became not hyper-conscious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">of every movement, but certainly far more aware of my posture and the various movements that I make,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and I have to say that has continued not just for several days or weeks, but for several months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">after that single day of movement practice with Ido, which I find remarkable and encouraging and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">has led me to start to incorporate some of those same movement practices into my daily routine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Needless to say, it was a very special experience for me to get direct movement instruction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">from the luminary of movement, Ido Pertal, and I also couldn't help myself but to ask Ido to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">perform some movement practices for us because he is so unbelievably skilled, and he most graciously did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzThWHk4CQ&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">[BLANK_AUDIO]</span></div></div></body></html>
