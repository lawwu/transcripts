Is there a sci-fi movie or book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=166">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or shows that was profound, that had an impact on you philosophically, or just specifically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=173">00:02:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">something you enjoyed nerding out about? >> Yeah, interesting.

It seemed very realistic or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=202">00:03:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">imaginable. And I thought that was really cool because they're awkward, they do funny things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=207">00:03:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it raised some interesting issues, but it seemed like something that would ultimately be helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=211">00:03:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and good if we could do it right. >> Yeah, he was an older, cranky gentleman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=214">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">>> He was an older, cranky jewel thief, yeah. >> It's kind of a funny little thing, which is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=219">00:03:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">he's a jewel thief, and so he pulls the robot into his life, which is something you could imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=227">00:03:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">taking a home robotics thing and pulling into whatever quirky thing that's involved in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=235">00:03:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">existence. >> Yeah, that's meaningful to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=237">00:03:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly so.

And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=256">00:04:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's hard for us as technologists to make that kind of technology. It's easier to mold people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=261">00:04:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">into what we need them to be. And just that opposite vision, I think, is really inspiring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=266">00:04:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">>> And then there's a anthropomorphization where we project certain things on them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=271">00:04:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because I think the robot was kind of dumb.

One of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=285">00:04:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we're learning from AI is where we are smart and where we are not smart. >> Yeah.

I've seen you in a TurboTax commercial as like, I guess, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=495">00:08:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">brilliant Einstein character.

So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=516">00:08:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">was teaching my class. It was an intro computer science class for non-concentrators, non-majors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=522">00:08:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes when people would visit campus, they would check in to say, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=528">00:08:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to see what a class is like. Can we sit on your class?" So a person came to my class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=534">00:08:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">who was the daughter of the brother of the husband of the best friend of my wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=545">00:09:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, basically a family friend came to campus to check out Brown and asked to come to my class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=553">00:09:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and came with her dad. Her dad is who I've known from various kinds of family events and so forth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=560">00:09:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but he also does advertising. And he said that he was recruiting scientists for this ad, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=568">00:09:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">TurboTax set of ads. And he said, "We wrote the ad with the idea that we get the most brilliant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=575">00:09:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">researchers, but they all said no. So can you help us find B-level scientists?" I'm like, "Sure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=584">00:09:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that's who I hang out with. So that should be fine." So I put together a list and I did what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=590">00:09:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">some people called a Dick Cheney. So I included myself on the list of possible candidates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=594">00:09:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">with a little blurb about each one and why I thought that would make sense for them to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=599">00:09:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they reached out to a handful of them, but then ultimately, YouTube stalked me a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=603">00:10:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and they thought, "Oh, I think he could do this." And they said, "Okay, we're going to offer you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=608">00:10:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the commercial." I'm like, "What?" So it was such an interesting experience because they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=615">00:10:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">another world. The people who do nationwide kind of ad campaigns and television shows and movies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=622">00:10:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and so forth, it's quite a remarkable system that they have going because they- - It's like a set?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=628">00:10:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, so I went to, it was just somebody's house that they rented in New Jersey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=634">00:10:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the commercial, it's just me and this other woman. In reality, there were 50 people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=641">00:10:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in that room and another, I don't know, half a dozen kind of spread out around the house in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=646">00:10:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">various ways. There were people whose job it was to control the sun. They were in the backyard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=651">00:10:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on ladders, putting filters up to try to make sure that the sun didn't glare off the window</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=656">00:10:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in a way that would wreck the shot. So there was like six people out there doing that. There was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=660">00:11:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">three people out there giving snacks, the craft table. There was another three people giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=665">00:11:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">healthy snacks because that was a separate craft table. There was one person whose job it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=669">00:11:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to keep me from getting lost. And I think the reason for all this is because so many people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=675">00:11:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are in one place at one time, they have to be time efficient. They have to get it done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=679">00:11:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The morning they were going to do my commercial, in the afternoon they were going to do a commercial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=683">00:11:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of a mathematics professor from Princeton. They had to get it done. No wasted time or energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=690">00:11:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's just a fleet of people all working as an organism. And it was fascinating. I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=695">00:11:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just the whole time, I'm just looking around like, this is so neat. Like one person whose job it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=699">00:11:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to take the camera off of the cameraman so that someone else whose job it was to remove the film</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=706">00:11:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">canister, because every couple's takes, they had to replace the film because film gets used up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=711">00:11:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It was just, I don't know. I was geeking out the whole time. It was so fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=715">00:11:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">- How many takes did it take? It looked the opposite. There was more than two people there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=719">00:11:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very relaxed. - Right, right. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=720">00:12:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The person who I was in the scene with is a professional. She's an improv comedian from New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=729">00:12:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">York City. And when I got there, they had given me a script, such as it was. And then I got there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=733">00:12:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and they said, "We're going to do this as improv."

Like how did you show up in this random person's house? I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=755">00:12:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, well, I mean, the reality of it is I stood outside in the blazing sun.

I started to sweat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=763">00:12:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I would wreck the shot because my face was all shiny with sweat.

And now it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9AbECvRt20&t=6460">01:47:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">not 100% universal, but it's quite widespread.
