Yeah, that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're starting to see this in some of my board meetings as well, where in 2022,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody was missing their numbers and reforecasting down, and then they would miss</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the reforecast.

And I would say, now I'm seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">companies beat the sort of the lower forecast in q4.

Is it a combo of the two? What do you think it actually is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a new baseline in the sense that if you go back to 2020 or 2021,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we considered good growth to be, you know, two to three x year over year. And now if it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from 60 to 80% growth year over year, you're happy. So there's definitely been a lowering of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">expectations. That being said, you still see in these numbers, there has been a bottoming out and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we're starting to not grow from this new baseline. So, for example, I think with Atlassian here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we are seeing an increase in spend basically in growth, right? So the way a recession is typically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">defined is two quarters of negative growth, right? We had six to seven quarters of decelerating or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">negative growth in SAS in tech and SAS, which is why I called it the SAS depression or be that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, it's actually kind of a depression. You're right. But now we're seeing quarter over quarter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">growth. So growth is re accelerating. Growth is higher than it was. So is he going to get to where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it was that probably will take some time, but it feels like the problems in the ecosystem work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves out. And now we're back to growth again. Yeah, I can add psychologically, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm on a couple of SAS boards as well. And psychologically, it felt like you tell me if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm right, SAS, SAX, and you saw the same thing. There were two years of calling up customers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and they were like, we're consolidating vendors. And by the way, we did a riff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we need 20% less seats. So we're going to have 20% less SAS companies that we're buying from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're going to have 20% less seats. So you start putting that all together. Man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody was just in psychological triage mode. We cannot spend money. I don't want to lose my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2263" target="_blank">00:37:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">job. So you're if you're a procurement person, you're the CTO, you don't want to lose your job,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2266" target="_blank">00:37:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't want to have more cuts.

And the point you would score the last two years was cutting costs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But the market ripping, and you now got a really, you know, efficient company, you're like, hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can we spend a little bit on SAS to make the remaining employees even more, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">productive?

So that's the other thing I see is like, people are like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">well, we'll take your software, but here's what we want to pay. And then they're coming to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">board and saying, Can we do this deal would have been a million dollar deal, but it's a $200,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, take the money, take the money.

So the SaaS company can no longer capture that much value, because the savings is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">actually less than that. Because the enterprise might say, hey, I'm going to hire someone and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of spending 60 grand a year, on your software, I'm going to allocate a quarter of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">an engineer's time to build that software, and it's going to replace that, that cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that that's still the case.

Then there's another group who's sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it out because they're like, hey, open source is going to win.

The valuations are absurd.

Actually, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you do a space for your subs, you can't actually just flip a switch and then release it to all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of your followers.

And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">even people in the open source movement will tell you that open AI is called six months ahead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they have no doubt that open source will get to where open AI is now in six months. Nonetheless,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if open AI just maintains a little bit of a lead over open source, then it could compound.

And it basically said you have to be at like 150 milliseconds, right? That's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">best in class performance or faster.

Anyways, the point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is, speed matters. Because in the absence of having very snappy response, you could have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">best model in the world.

One is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3241" target="_blank">00:54:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">quality of how the model is, but two is the speed and its responsiveness, which is a function of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">again, hardware and your ability to basically tokenize tokens per second very, very quickly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3252" target="_blank">00:54:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so that developers are incentivized to not just play around in a sandbox, but to actually build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3257" target="_blank">00:54:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">production code.

And that's the big thing that nobody talks about. For example, like AWS, if you look inside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of how expensive it is to build an app there, I've tried, even when they give you credits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the credits they give you aren't sufficient enough to even pay for half the power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the way that they schedule and the way that they try to orchestrate you to use hardware,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3280" target="_blank">00:54:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">makes building production apps unless you are willing to spend millions and millions of dollars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for a very slow app, unfeasible.

So if you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3487" target="_blank">00:58:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">using the open internet, llama, Mistral, open AI, they're all getting to the same quality code point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and they will be there within the next six to nine months. So that's business number one on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">open AI.

In fact, if you look at their open AI days, what they talk about is they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3520" target="_blank">00:58:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sell, they've sold already to like 94% of the fortune 500. What does that mean? I think what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually means is they've sold a lot of test environments and sandboxing.

So let's just back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">up. Here's the path that open AI is on. So step one, get hundreds of millions of consumers using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3618" target="_blank">01:00:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it and getting them to view open AI or chat GPT as the Google in this area, right? Strong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3625" target="_blank">01:00:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">presumption. This is just the one you go to when you have a question. Step two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">these same people, these same consumers now want to use chat GPT at work because there's some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">research they want to do. So open AI has just rolled out both enterprise licenses and team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">workspaces.

Okay. And so let's say that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the customer support team and you want to create a GPT to help customer support answer cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3673" target="_blank">01:01:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You could basically then train chat GPT on, let's say every customer support ticket and email</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3685" target="_blank">01:01:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that the company has ever produced.

Let me build on your example. So I run a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">small software company during the day called hustle.

And so we wanted to eliminate those those tickets, right. So I actually went and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I built a GPT, which was called the privacy policy generator, because a lot of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">trouble tickets were because the privacy policies were bad. And we trained them using a handful of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">ones that were good, and a handful of ones that are bad with a bunch of rules. And I trained them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on.

It's also true for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4090" target="_blank">01:08:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know, all of the image generation.

And so to your point, it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4105" target="_blank">01:08:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we're all operating from the same brittle, very fixed, small quantum of training information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4111" target="_blank">01:08:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that is why I think like Facebook, and Google are doing a really important job by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">deciding that these models should be free.

So for example, whenever like, if you were using a lot of Google services,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4138" target="_blank">01:08:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like GFS, BigTable, BigQuery, you know, TensorFlow, the versions that you had access to via GCP,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4147" target="_blank">01:09:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was always one or two generations behind what the Google employees got to use, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4151" target="_blank">01:09:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was still so much better than anything else that we could get anywhere else that you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4156" target="_blank">01:09:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">still build to those endpoints. And I think there's a similar version of this, where Facebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4161" target="_blank">01:09:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and Google probably realized like, look, we'll have version five running internally to optimize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4167" target="_blank">01:09:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ads and all of this other stuff that makes our business that much better.

But version three is still trained on so much proprietary data that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's so much better than version 10.

YouTube is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4186" target="_blank">01:09:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">collection of things people want to share.

I mean, I think the big picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4590" target="_blank">01:16:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is right.

I think in the office market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4595" target="_blank">01:16:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in particular, the typical office deal is more like one third equity and two thirds debt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot more leverage, right?
