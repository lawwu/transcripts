Can you describe at the high level</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=66">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the game of poker Texas Hold'em, heads-up Texas Hold'em, for people who might not be familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=70">00:01:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with this card game? Yeah, happy to. So, heads-up no limit Texas Hold'em has really emerged in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=77">00:01:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">AI community as a main benchmark for testing these application-independent algorithms for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=84">00:01:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">imperfect information game solving. And this is a game that's actually played by humans. You don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=91">00:01:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">see that much on TV or casinos because, well, for various reasons, but you do see it in some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=98">00:01:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">expert-level casinos and you see it in the best poker movies of all time. It's actually an event</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=104">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the World Series of Poker, but mostly it's played online and typically for pretty big sums</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=110">00:01:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of money. And this is a game that usually only experts play. So, if you go to your home game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=117">00:01:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on a Friday night, it probably is not going to be heads-up no limit Texas Hold'em. It might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=121">00:02:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">no limit Texas Hold'em in some cases, but typically for a big group and it's not as competitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=128">00:02:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">While heads-up means it's two players, so it's really like me against you. Am I better or are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=134">00:02:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you better? Much like chess or go in that sense, but an imperfect information game,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=139">00:02:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which makes it much harder because I have to deal with issues of you knowing things that I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=144">00:02:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">know and I know things that you don't know instead of pieces being nicely laid on the board for both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=149">00:02:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of us to see. So, in Texas Hold'em, there's two cards that you only see that belong to you. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=157">00:02:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there is, they gradually lay out some cards that add up overall to five cards that everybody can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=163">00:02:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">see. So, the imperfect nature of the information is the two cards that you're holding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=168">00:02:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Up front, yeah. So, as you said, you first get two cards in private each and then there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=174">00:02:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">betting round. Then you get three cards in public on the table, then there's a betting round. Then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=179">00:02:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you get the fourth card in public on the table, there's a betting round. Then you get the fifth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=183">00:03:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">card on the table, there's a betting round. So, there's a total of four betting rounds and four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=188">00:03:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">tranches of information revelation, if you will. Only the first tranche is private and then it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=194">00:03:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">public from there. And this is probably by far the most popular game in AI and just the general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=205">00:03:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">public in terms of imperfect information. So, it's probably the most popular spectator game to watch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=212">00:03:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So, which is why it's a super exciting game to tackle. So, it's on the order of chess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=219">00:03:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, in terms of popularity, in terms of the AI setting it as the bar of what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=225">00:03:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence. So, in 2017, Libratus, how do you pronounce it? Libratus. Libratus. Libratus beats...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=232">00:03:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Little Latin there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=233">00:03:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">A little bit of Latin. Libratus beats a few, four expert human players. Can you describe that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=242">00:04:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">event? What you learned from it? What was it like? What was the process in general for people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=247">00:04:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have not read the papers and studied? Yeah. So, the event was that we invited four of the top 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=254">00:04:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">players, who these are specialist players in Heads Up No Limit Texas Hold'em, which is very important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=258">00:04:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because this game is actually quite different than the multiplayer version. We brought them in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=264">00:04:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to Pittsburgh to play at the Rivers Casino for 20 days. We wanted to get 120,000 hands in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=271">00:04:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because we wanted to get statistical significance. So, it's a lot of hands for humans to play,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=278">00:04:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">even for these top pros who play fairly quickly normally. So, we couldn't just have one of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=284">00:04:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">play so many hands. 20 days they were playing, basically morning to evening, and I raised 200,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=293">00:04:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as a little incentive for them to play. And the setting was so that they didn't all get 50,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=300">00:05:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually paid them out based on how they did against the AI each. So, they had an incentive to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=306">00:05:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">play as hard as they could, whether they're way ahead or way behind or right at the mark of beating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=312">00:05:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the AI. And you don't make any money, unfortunately. Right. No, we can't make any money. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=318">00:05:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">originally, a couple of years earlier, I actually explored whether we could actually play for money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=324">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because that would be, of course, interesting as well to play against the top people for money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=329">00:05:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But the Pennsylvania Gaming Board said no. So, we couldn't. So, this is much like an exhibit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=335">00:05:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like for a musician or a boxer or something like that. Nevertheless, you were keeping track of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=341">00:05:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">money and Labradors won close to $2 million, I think. So, if it was for real money, if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=350">00:05:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">able to earn money, that was a quite impressive and inspiring achievement. Just a few details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=357">00:05:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What were the players looking at? Were they behind a computer? What was the interface like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=362">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. They were playing much like they normally do. These top players, when they play this game,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=367">00:06:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they play mostly online. So, they're used to playing through a UI. And they did the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=372">00:06:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">thing here. So, there was this layout. You could imagine there's a table on a screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=377">00:06:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the human sitting there, and then there's the AI sitting there. And the screen shows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=383">00:06:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">everything that's happening. The card's coming out and shows the bets being made. And we also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=388">00:06:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">had the betting history for the human. So, if the human forgot what had happened in the hand so far,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=393">00:06:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they could actually reference back and so forth. Is there a reason they were given access to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=399">00:06:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">betting history? Well, it didn't really matter. They wouldn't have forgotten anyway. These are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=407">00:06:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">top quality people. But we just wanted to put out there so it's not a question of a human forgetting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=413">00:06:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and the AI somehow trying to get advantage of better memory. So, what was that like? I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=417">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that was an incredible accomplishment. So, what did it feel like before the event? Did you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=423">00:07:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have doubt, hope? Where was your confidence at? Yeah, that's great. Great question. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=430">00:07:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">18 months earlier, I had organized a similar brains versus AI competition with a previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=436">00:07:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">AI called Cloudico, and we couldn't beat the humans. So, this time around, it was only 18</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=442">00:07:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">months later, and I knew that this new AI, Libratus, was way stronger. But it's hard to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=449">00:07:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">how you'll do against the top humans before you try. So, I thought we had about a 50/50 shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=454">00:07:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the international betting sites put us as a four to one or five to one underdog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=461">00:07:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's kind of interesting that people really believe in people over AI.

So Nash equilibrium,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1208">00:20:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which John Nash introduced in 1950, introduces what rational play is when you have more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1214">00:20:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one player. And these are pairs of strategies where strategies are contingency plans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1220">00:20:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one for each player, so that neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1226">00:20:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">given that the other doesn't deviate. But as a side effect, you get the beliefs from Bayes' rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1233">00:20:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So Nash equilibrium really isn't just deriving in these imperfect information games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1238">00:20:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Nash equilibrium doesn't just define strategies.

So you know the game rock, paper, scissors. So we can draw it as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1278">00:21:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">player one moves first, and then player two moves. But of course, it's important that player two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1284">00:21:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't know what player one moved. Otherwise, player two would win every time. So we can draw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1289">00:21:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that as an information set where player one makes one of three moves first, and then there's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1294">00:21:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">information set for player two. So player two doesn't know which of those nodes the world is in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1301">00:21:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But once we know the strategy for player one, Nash equilibrium will say that you play one-third rock,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1307">00:21:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one-third paper, one-third scissors. From that, I can derive my beliefs on the information set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1312">00:21:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that they're one-third, one-third, one-third. So Bayes gives you that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1316">00:21:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Bayes gives you. But is that specific to a particular player, or is it something you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1322">00:22:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly update with the specific player? No, the game theory isn't really player specific.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1328">00:22:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's also why we don't need any data. We don't need any history how these particular humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1333">00:22:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">played in the past, or how any AI or human had played before. It's all about rationality. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1341">00:22:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the AI just thinks about what would a rational opponent do, and what would I do if I am rational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1347">00:22:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the idea of game theory.

And when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1375">00:22:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you start to exploit an opponent, you typically open yourself up to exploitation. And these guys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1382">00:23:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">have so few holes to exploit, and they're world's leading experts in counter-exploitation. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1386">00:23:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">decided that we're not going to turn that stuff on. Actually, I saw a few of your papers exploiting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1391">00:23:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">opponents. It sounded very interesting to explore. Do you think there's room for exploitation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1397">00:23:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">generally outside of Libratus? Is there a subject or people differences that could be exploited,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1405">00:23:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe not just in poker, but in general interactions and negotiations, all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1410">00:23:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">other domains that you're considering? Yeah, definitely. We've done some work on that. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1416">00:23:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I really like the work that hybridizes the two. So you figure out what would a rational opponent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1422">00:23:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">do. And by the way, that's safe in these zero-sum games, two-player zero-sum games,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1427">00:23:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">because if the opponent does something irrational, yes, it might throw off my beliefs. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1434">00:23:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">amount that the player can gain by throwing off my belief is always less than they lose by playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1440">00:24:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">poorly. So it's safe. But still, if somebody's weak as a player, you might want to play differently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1448">00:24:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to exploit them more. So you can think about it this way. A game theoretic strategy is unbeatable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1454">00:24:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but it doesn't maximally beat the other opponent.

Then if you move up from just repeated, simple repeated matrix games,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1609">00:26:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">not all the way to extensive form games, but in between, there's stochastic games, where,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1615">00:26:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, there's these, you think about it like these little matrix games, and when you take an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1621">00:27:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">action and your opponent takes an action, they determine not which next state I'm going to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1627">00:27:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">next game I'm going to, but the distribution over next games where I might be going to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1632">00:27:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the stochastic game.

So I can play a different equilibrium from you and we'll still get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1735">00:28:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right values of the game.

The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1783">00:29:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">problem is that there can be many. And then there's a question of which equilibrium to select.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1789">00:29:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you select your strategy from a different equilibrium and I select mine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1797">00:29:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">then what does that mean? And in these non-zero sum games, we may lose some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1803">00:30:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">joint benefit by being just simply stupid.

And in three player, you get other problems also like collusion. Like maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1814">00:30:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you and I can gang up on a third player and we can do radically better by colluding. So there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1820">00:30:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are lots of issues that come up there.

Yeah, so I've done a lot of work on coalitional games. And we actually have a paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1871">00:31:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">here with my other student Gabriele Farina and some other collaborators on, at NIPS on that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1876">00:31:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">actually just came back from the poster session where we presented this. But so when you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1881">00:31:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">collusion, it's a different problem.

Do you have information about the fact that other players are cooperating? Or is it just this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1908">00:31:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">chaos that where nothing is known? So there's some things unknown. Can you give an example of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1913">00:31:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">collusion type game? Or is it usually... So like bridge. So think about bridge. It's like when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1920">00:32:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I are on a team, our payoffs are the same.

So when I get my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1927">00:32:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">cards, I can't whisper to you what my cards are.

So we have to somehow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1934">00:32:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">coordinate our strategies ahead of time and only ahead of time. And then there's certain signals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1941">00:32:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we can talk about, but they have to be such that the other team also understands that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1946">00:32:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's an example where the coordination is already built into the rules of the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1952">00:32:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in many other situations like auctions or negotiations or diplomatic relationships,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1959">00:32:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">poker, it's not really built in, but it still can be very helpful for the colluders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1965">00:32:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I've read you write somewhere, with negotiations, you come to the table with prior,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1971">00:32:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like a strategy that you're willing to do and not willing to do, those kinds of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1978">00:32:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you start to now moving away from poker, moving beyond poker into other applications like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=1984">00:33:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">negotiations?

How do you think about that? - So I do think about that a lot. I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3527">00:58:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">biggest two threats that we're facing as mankind, one is climate change, and the other is nuclear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3532">00:58:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">war. So those are my main two worries that I worry about. And I've tried to do something about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3539">00:58:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">climate, thought about trying to do something for climate change twice. I actually, for two of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3544">00:59:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">startups, I've actually commissioned studies of what we could do on those things. And we didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3549">00:59:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">really find a sweet spot, but I'm still keeping an eye out on that. If there's something where we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3554">00:59:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">could actually provide a market solution or optimization solution or some other technology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3559">00:59:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">solution to problems. Right now, like for example, pollution, great markets was what we were looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3566">00:59:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at then. And it was much more the lack of political will by those markets were not so successful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3572">00:59:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than bad market design. So I could go in and make a better market design,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3577">00:59:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but that wouldn't really move the needle on the world very much if there's no political will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3581">00:59:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the US, you know, the market, at least the Chicago market was just shut down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3585">00:59:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. So then it doesn't really help how great your market design was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3590">00:59:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So on the nuclear side, it's more so global warming is a more encroaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3596">00:59:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">problem.

So how do you think about what is the mechanism design there that just made everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3611">01:00:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">seem stable?

And it doesn't require any computation. With small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3626">01:00:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">matrices, you can actually convince yourself that the game is such that nobody wants to initiate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3630">01:00:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a very coarse grained analysis. And it really works in a situation where you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3638">01:00:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">two superpowers or small number of superpowers.

You have a smaller</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3642">01:00:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">nuke. So the threshold of initiating is smaller, and you have smaller countries and non-nation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7bStIQovcY&t=3650">01:00:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">actors who may get nukes and so on.
