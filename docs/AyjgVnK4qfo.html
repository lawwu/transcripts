Duncan, one area where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">investors haven't really had to think about protecting themselves to the downside is bonds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that interest rates have risen quite a bit, people are finally saying, "Oh wait, bonds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">can actually fall in price a little bit." This is especially true for long-duration bonds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the reasons that certain investors like to hold long-duration bonds is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">they tend to give you more bang for your buck during a recession. If interest rates fall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and we go into deflation, all else equal, higher-duration bonds will have greater sensitivity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to changed rates. When rates rise, prices fall more than shorter-term bonds, but when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">rates fall, those prices tend to rise more. So, let's look at the TLT as the 20-year Treasury</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ETF. In 2019, it was up 14%. In 2020, it was up 18%. In 2022, it's down 22%. So, Innovator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">has this TLT ETF that has a buffer to the downside. So, it protects you with 9% buffer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning the first down 9%, if you start from zero, you're protected. But it also has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">cap of 27%. So, your defined outcomes are, you can earn as much as 27%, and your first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">9% is capped for losses. Now, the thinking here would be, okay, we could see inflation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">remain stubbornly high, and that could see rates rise even further on the high end, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that would crush them some more. So, we want to protect on the downside. Alternatively,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the Fed could get its way, raise rates enough where the economy slows, and we actually do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">get some disinflation, or maybe even deflation, and rates fall again. And then, you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">want to miss out on those gains. So, the way you use these defined outcomes ETFs is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a cap on the upside, but you have some buffer to the downside. Pretty interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, no matter what happens, you're kind of okay. And that's why they have these defined</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">outcomes, so you have the ranges to know.

A bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of people are going to be in the comments saying, "Well, look at the individual stocks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I own.

I'd love to have those returns right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The stock market itself, though, it's not necessarily in a crash, even though sentiment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">feels like we're in a crash. So, I don't know if that's good news or bad news. Because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">good news, maybe things haven't gotten as bad as people think. Obviously, you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">adjust these for inflation and say they're a little worse.

At the end, people just kind of gave up. The stock market peaked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in October 2007. We didn't bottom until March 2009. If you think about it, all that stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that happened with Lehman Brothers and AIG and all the bank blowups, that was in September</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and October of 2008.

So, that lasted so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">long that people, at the end, had kind of just thrown up their hands and given up. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that, for sure, was just as bad.

So, John,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">fill up the first table here. I took this from Assaf Damodaran at NYU, and stocks, bonds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and cash going back to 1928.

Those are the actual compounded returns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, over that same time frame, inflation was roughly 3% per year. So, you can see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the real returns go down by that inflation rate.

Bonds are close to 2%, and cash is pretty close to zero. So, based on market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">history, 2% real and 0% real are conservative. But, I think when setting expectations for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the future, you have to take the present into account, right?

Historical earnings growth is 3% real. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">let's call it 5% as your baseline, right?

But, do you think that 0% for bonds as a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">is realistic?

Like, right now, maybe it is. But, like, over the long term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I expect there to be some real return there. I expect it to be like, you know, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">most of history was like, you know, 1% to 2%. You were looking at 2% to 4% nominal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">probably 1% to 2% real. And so, 0% to 1% right now is probably what we'll expect going forward,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but I don't know. I mean, it's really time period specific, right? So, I want to hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's going to be some real return there, but there's no guarantee. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">on equities, yeah, I think I usually plan for 4% to 5% real, and there's a lot of data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that shows that across countries, even. Across a lot of other countries, you'll see like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">4% to 5% real is probably a fair estimate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So, John, throw this on the table. A lot of people say, "Well, all the returns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">on financial markets has come because of disinflation and interest rates falling since 1980." So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked at 1928 to 1980. What did stocks, bonds, and cash do?

Now, it's important to remember that this is during a period that includes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the Great Depression and World War II and the war in Vietnam and all sorts of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">crashes and recessions in bear markets. So, I wanted to look at a period where things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">were pretty nasty, and you had literally the worst crash in the history of the United States</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">stock market, and you still got almost 6% real in stocks. So, I know people are very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">bearish right now and don't feel very good, but maybe that time period is a little more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">representative of considering the starting valuations and interest rates and all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjgVnK4qfo&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff.
