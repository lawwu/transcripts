And they didn't do it in 2022, which was sad. So there's like a low period 2020 2021. We're good 2023 had a release that was like not as popular, but still did well. And then 2024, obviously the flowing hair coin.</p><p>So we don't really know what's going to come in next year until maybe about a month from now. And then I can tell you like that one might be okay. And then we need to wait for a little bit more info. But I had been writing about the flowing hair coin since like June.</p><p>And I have mockups done and everything and then everyone started using that. So I think it was really good for us to be able to be early on that information. And then we also got some a little bit of insider stuff just because we're a bulk supplier of the mint so we can see a little bit before the public sees like what the mintage is going to be like, what that coin might actually look like and stuff.</p></div></div></body></html>
