The idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">physical discipline is not in style in our culture. So it's hard for people because in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">our culture, a parent who does physical discipline is regarded as kind of a simple-minded person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who's not too creative and can't think of better ways to deal with children and occasionally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">gets upset and just hits their kids out of frustration.

So people think if you're in favor of spanking, what you're in favor of is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">very capricious, arbitrary thing where a parent gets angry and when he's had it up to his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">eyeballs, he starts flailing his kids.

I'm smarter than that. I want to do something more intelligent, more sensitive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and something that would be better for my kids." So that's one set of problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think also, Tony, we have to acknowledge that there are many people, young people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are parents today who are in their 20s and 30s who were raised by Christian people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">spanked them in anger. And they were abused. They were struck when their parents were angry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and frustrated and out of sorts. And so the parents, when they struck them excessively,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">struck them capriciously, something they might get away with one day, another day they would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">be spanked for. Spanking wasn't always an orderly process. Sometimes they would just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">get hit. And it was all under the rubric of "Spare the rod, spoil the child," which, by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the way, is not in the Bible anywhere. And they promised themselves, "I will never do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that to my kids. I hated that. I'm not going to be that kind of a parent."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to say to young couples who have had that life experience, I want to commend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you. I want to stand in solidarity with you and say, "You must not do that. That was wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It was wrong." However well-intentioned your parents might have been, it was wrong for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">them to discipline you in that way. But I want to offer to you something that is very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">very different than that. So I think that a huge problem is that there are people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">were abused. I think it's also important to make a distinction, and I've been doing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">increasingly when I do seminars. I make a distinction between correction and discipline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">especially with little children. There are a lot of things that require correction that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">do not necessarily require discipline. And sometimes when parents embrace the idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">spanking and they say, "Okay, the Bible says I should do this. I'm going to do it," then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they start spanking for everything. It's kind of like that old adage, you know, "If the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." And so I think parents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">need to make a distinction. There are a lot of things that children do that are wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that require correction, that are not necessarily defiant. The only thing I want to discipline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for is defiant behavior. Failure to honor, failure to obey mom and dad. Defiance I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to discipline. But there are a lot of other things that kids do that require correction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, no, honey, you can't hit your sister." And I can talk to that child about the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that you may not hit your sister. Now, if the hitting persists, obviously we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to have to deal with that as disobedience, as discipline. But there are a lot of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or an illustration I gave in one of these earlier podcasts, the child that bowls over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">his younger sister and takes her toy, that's impulsive behavior on the part of the child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a three-year-old.

He grabs, he sees something he wants, he grabs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it, especially if he can overpower the person that has it. That's impulsive behavior. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">not defiant behavior. Now, does it require correction? Sure. "Honey, no, you can't do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that.

But it does not require discipline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If I can have an intervention that solves the problem without discipline, by correcting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XstU6tcMME&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that's going to be my first approach to wrong behavior.
