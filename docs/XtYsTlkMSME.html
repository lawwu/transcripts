My friend recently sent me an article</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">saying that young people shouldn't save money.

Luxury vehicles. I love this question. Great one, Michael. A lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually sent me the paper he's referencing when it came out. I read it. I don't agree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with all the conclusions, but I do kind of appreciate the spicy take the authors take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Like it's a pretty spicy take. Retirement research papers are generally boring. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a person who enjoys this stuff and I find most of them boring. So here's the main crux</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of the argument. This is from the conclusion of the of the article, because a lot of times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to like buy these from some financial journal and they just give you the conclusion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of the intro. And that's usually enough. So we argue that under realistic assumptions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the life cycle model implies that most young people should not save for retirement. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the general conclusion. High income workers tend to experience wage growth over their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">careers for these workers, maintaining a steady standard of living as possible, therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">requires spending all income, all young and only starting to save for retirement during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">middle age. So I kind of, there are some aspects I kind of agree with here. In theory, in theory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it does make sense that your income should rise over time. Therefore, enjoy your youth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">put off saving for another day. That's great. And there probably are a handful of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">who are disciplined enough to plan ahead and say, listen, I'm going to make more money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in the future. I'll start saving then, you know, I'm going to enjoy myself from my early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">twenties to my early thirties.

Here's the problem with this idea. It sounds great in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a spreadsheet, you know, in a textbook, as your income grows, you begin to spend more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">money and you get used to a new lifestyle, right? You gain responsibilities as you age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you get used to some of the finer things in life. And I have a hard time believing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that after 10 to 15 years of that, people can all of a sudden flip a switch and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">go, okay, now I'm going to save because psychologically those new savings are going to feel like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">loss, not a gain at that point. All the behavioral research from Kahneman and all these people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">says that losses sting twice as bad as gains make us feel good. So even though you'd technically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">be saving money and putting it aside, taking it out of your income at that point is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to feel like a loss. So it's going to be hard to do. So I think this idea is probably a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pipe dream. Uh, now I understand it's not easy to save as a young person, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">when you want to enjoy yourself. I went through this. My first job out of college did not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pay very well at all. I still wanted to have some fun and didn't have a ton of discretionary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">income. So I started small and I, it was like $50 a month into a target date retirement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">fund. Of course, very prudent. Uh, and I made more money. You said, you said your first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">investment ever was a CD on animals this week, which just killed me.

But as I made more money, I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">save half my raise and spend the other half so I could give myself a little bit of a bump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in standard of living. But the idea was to build up saving habits. And I think those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">early savings habits can compound just as much as the compound interest. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">getting into those habits, if you can, that, that, that's very helpful. The thing is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this person, they make a quarter of a million dollars in their twenties. I don't care where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you live. That's a lot of money for someone who's 24. So it's not going to be that hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to find spare change. So here's what I'm going to do for this person. I would say, pick a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">reasonable savings rate. Now I always say I want double digits. So 10 to 20% is fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for this person. If you want to go splurge for the rest, my answer is unequivocally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, splurge. You don't know what your future earnings powers are going to be, but if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">making that much money at age 24, you're in a pretty good place. You obviously don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to go overboard. So I think just make sure you're still saving. Then, you know, for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">single person who's young and no responsibilities, you should have plenty of discretionary income,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">even if you save 30% of your income or something. However, I'm not a fan of spending a ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">money on a car. So I would, I would, I recommend this person to do is read happy money by Elizabeth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Dunn and Michael Norton. Put it up there. Yeah. One of my favorite books, it's all about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the science of spending and what actually makes us happy when it comes to expenditure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So the book lays out five ways that research has shown that spending money can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">make you happier and not simply give you that short-term dopamine hit. So the five things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">are by experiences, not stuff, right? Make it a treat, which is just don't overindulge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It's, it's better when you space things out and don't do them all the time. They say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">by time, which is basically paying up for convenience. The fourth one is pay now and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">consume later, which is basically avoiding credit card debt. And the fifth one is invest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in others. So charity, picking up tabs for friends, helping others. I think the big one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">here for some of their twenties is to buy experiences. So their research shows that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">experiences provide way more happiness than material goods in part, because experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">are more likely to make us feel connected to others. And they have these long lasting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">memories that also compound over time. So I would say before you buy that Porsche, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Porsche Duncan, you know, spend some of that discretionary income on going out more, traveling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">go out to eat, do stuff with your friends on nights and weekends, like do stuff, don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">buy stuff. And you know, when we were young, my wife and I made a concerted effort before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">having kids to travel as much as we could, because we knew once the kids came around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it would be a lot much harder to do. And it's, it's true. It's money well spent. I'm glad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we did it. So I think you get way more bang for your buck by spending on travel and experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">than a car. Wait until you go through a midlife crisis, then buy the Porsche. Don't do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in your 20s.

So I think the memories you make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from going on a bunch of trips in your 20s, traveling, doing stuff with your friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the kind of stuff that lasts a lifetime, the the new car smell fades away quicker than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that.

If you really want to go out, you know, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">get something, you can't just get a Porsche.

Well, yes, at 24, making a huge income. Again, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you you say you can save a decent amount of your money, max out your 401k.

Great question, though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to splurge on a car, don't let me hold you back.

I don't think you're going to look back at buying a Porsche at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">24 and think that was a good idea. Just what do you think? What do you think they do? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a pretty, pretty nice salary for a 24 year old. That's got to be software engineer or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">something, right? I'm guessing that's that'd be my guess. They're working for Google or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon or some something like that. Right. All right. Let's do another one. Okay. Up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">next, we have a question from Ed. When was the last time in history people rushed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">buy government bonds?

All right. So this is this is the fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the last two weeks we had a little bit of a banking crisis. Interest rates dropped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like a rock in some cases. This question is actually relatively easy to answer because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">2022 was the outlier in terms of people not rushing to buy government bonds during a down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">stock market.

Every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">single one of those years, treasuries did great. People rushed into that flight to safety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to buy bonds. 2022, again, is the outlier where you saw bonds actually cause the stock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">market pain. So most of the time when the excrement hits the fan, people rush into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">safety of government bonds. And that's kind of what happened in the last couple of weeks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">with the banking crisis. So it's nothing new to see nervous investors leap into the open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">arms of U.S. government bonds during a crisis. It's just that, yeah, last year was kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">an outlier. So the question here is, will the drop in rates from this bank crisis actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">lead to higher inflation? So the idea here is that for bonds, that the relationship is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">easy. When bond prices, as rates rise, prices fall. And as rates fall, prices rise. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the inverse relationship between bonds and prices. But the relationship between rates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and inflation is not quite so easy. For instance, interest rates went to zero during the 2008</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">financial crisis and stayed there for almost a decade. They remained low until basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">inflation really had these last couple of years. From 2009 to 2019, the 10-year yield</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">averaged 2.5%. John, do a chart on here. The 10-year average 2.5%. Inflation over that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">time was 1.6% per year on average. We had low rates for well over a decade. That didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">cause inflation. So I think a lot of what we're thinking through here is, well, if rates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">fall, that must mean inflation has to go up. And that's not necessarily how this works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of it depends on why rates are falling. Now, it seems like right now, sometimes you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">don't really know. It could just be that the bond market is confused.

One is this banking crisis, right? Because people are worried.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the second one is the bond market seems to think that means the Fed is going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to cut interest rates or stop raising them because of this banking crisis. The Fed obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is not. Yesterday, they still raised rates. The bond market says, "I don't believe you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the roundberry. "I don't believe you," right? So I think if the banking crisis leads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to slower loan growth and thus slower economic growth, it would make sense for rates to fall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in that case, if economic growth is going to be slower, guess what? Inflation is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to come down too. So there is no easy relationship. In the textbooks, this is what I learned in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">economics class, right? If rates fall, inflation should go up. The last 10 or 15 years really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">disproved that. So it's really going to matter why are rates falling. That's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the big thing. So maybe the past couple of weeks could change people's spending habits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and alter the economy. It's a good possibility. I think it's also a confusing time. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">don't think I'd put too much into two weeks worth of bond market moves. Rates could easily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">go back up. They could go down further. Who knows? But it's important to remember that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">rates falling in and of themselves don't automatically cause inflation.

If it was that easy, the Fed would have snuffed inflation out a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">long time ago. Because as we've seen, just because the Fed is raising rates doesn't mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">inflation falls right away either. It's not that easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it looks like I'm doing a poll in the chat. 55% of people are more worried about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">inflation than the other option was banking crisis or not worried.

But no, Ben, you're right. I mean, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">answer to why you can't just contribute directly to a Roth IRA is you have to have earned income.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's exactly what Ethan is getting at here, is that he's thinking long-term. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I give him a lot of credit there. He has one 529 account open, and he's saying, "Hey, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">really want to take advantage of this provision. Let's talk about it really quick." The idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is if you have money left over in a 529, Ben, I don't have a lot of clients that spend too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">little on college. Ultimately, college is a very expensive enterprise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it is funny when people worry about that, that it's pretty rare for that to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a very good problem to have.

And I think what Ethan's going is, "Do I want to purposely do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">overfund a 529?"

And it's a great avenue to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">basically do an effective backdoor Roth. The problem is, that Ethan's getting at, is there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple of contingencies here. Number one, the 529 account needs to be open for 15 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for this to happen, right? So if you're opening a 529 account now, yeah, you're looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">2037, 2038 being the earliest time that you can conduct this rollover. The second provision,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Ethan mentioned this is original question, contributions that you roll over need to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">more than five years old. So ultimately, again, you can't do this instantaneously. You can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just open up a 529 and then roll it directly to a Roth. That's not the way it works. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so Ethan's thinking long-term.

What the point of all this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what they're trying to do? Yeah, before we get into this, Bill, here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">my-- if I became tax czar one day, or if you did and you're asking me for some advice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we get these questions all the time about people who are close to the limit. Why don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we give people a one-year mulligan? One year, you get close, maybe your income goes over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because you have variable income. Oh, whoops, you were over the limit, but you contributed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to Roth, one-year mulligan. Yeah, I like this idea. Unfortunately, Ben,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you and me are not writing the tax code. They haven't let us do this from Grand Rapids or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Pine Island or where Duncan is right now. Duncan, let's talk about what you're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about. In order to directly contribute to a Roth IRA, your income cannot exceed $214,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">joint, right? So these are relatively wealthy people problems. Let's go back to question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one, or let's start making $200,000 at age 23. That's what this is for. And the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is, hey, you're making too much money, right? We want to take some of the tax benefits away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and ultimately, let's reallocate those tax benefits to folks at lower incomes. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">due to a quirk in the tax code, you're allowed to circumvent this by a backdoor Roth contribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the idea is there's no income limit to contribute to a traditional IRA, and there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">no income limit to convert from traditional to Roth IRA.

Maybe they have some expenses that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they need to deduct.

We don't know what the situation is, but ultimately, they're not sure. And if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not sure, the idea is just do the traditional contribution, and you can backdate that up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to April 15th into last year. That's the concept. It kind of sounded like an anvil was falling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">from the sky on you.

That was kind of a porky pig, bug's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">bunny.

That's not me. That's a much nicer ride than I can afford. But ultimately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea is backdoor Roth contributions are great, but the big catch that the listener</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">gets at is if you do an IRA conversion, you have assets that are in a tax-deferred IRA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to convert as if that's the entire balance.

Is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtYsTlkMSME&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">because they don't want people to do it because they make it hard?
