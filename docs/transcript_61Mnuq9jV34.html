I cared about beating his record and he cares about beating my record and then he kind of like gave it up and I lost.</p><p>I think I think that's a huge insight for you. I think you can replicate that you've got other Kevin roses in your life. You can find a Kevin Rose on Twitter right now. And so I think that's epic. And by the way, same with me like who I am on a basketball court.</p><p>Or a tennis court the level of effort and work I put on in that environment versus what I do in the gym is like 10 to 5 like 10 on the court 5 in the gym. So I understand that and I think that that's something you should try to figure out.</p></div></div></body></html>
