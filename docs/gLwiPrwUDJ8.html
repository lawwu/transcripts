Let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So before I start the stock, I would love to set a tone for I'm not here to lecture you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but I would love to have much more collaborative and interactive session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do hear I've heard a lot of, you know, people kind of concerning about AI and the future of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I understand that the development of a GI is both scary and exhilarating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if anything, I would love to get for you to get out from the stock is the fact that I think everybody can have like very meaningful future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and everybody can like build something really, really cool with an AI and as a part of this journey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So before I started with a talk, there'll be all about how ARAO is a co-design of product and research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we are shifting both in the labs, we're shifting the focus towards more of a frontier product research,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where the tasks that we teach the models are becoming much more real world tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So and before we get started, I'll just like share some of the vignettes of like what I'm really, really excited about the future of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and what the AI is capable of right now that can inspire everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one is actually education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually really, really excited about the fact that AI can democratize education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's an example of me asking ChatGPT to explain the Gaussian distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then with, and in Canvas, it creates, you know, the code itself in order to visualize for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it explains in text, and then I ask it to write in code, and then you can render the code in order to visualize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a way, it becomes much more, a little bit personalized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The second demo is also something that a lot of people might want to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's, let's see if you take a screenshot from the paper and you want to understand what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the model can go and explain in a separate canvas, that's like another feature in ChatGPT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, then you can start to have much more interactive conversation with the model by selecting very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">certain like things and try to like ask more questions, you know, follow up questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a way, when ChatGPT came out to be first in 2022, it was purely conversational UI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was mostly chat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as the use cases kind of grown from the product itself, you know, there was no expectation of how people would use ChatGPT at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But over time, you've seen a lot of people started using it for code generation, for writing and long form writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It became very obvious that the interface of Chat was kind of very limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, canvas is kind of like the first attempt, uh, of, um, of our team to break out from the cycle in order to allow people to have much more fine-grained collaboration with AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, and actually today, uh, Antarctic published a small report, uh, around the education and how people use, uh, Claude for education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very interesting to see the correlation between the U.S. bachelor's use and the way people use, um, um, yeah, use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see there's a huge difference between, like, computer science there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, another thing that I'm really, really excited about the AIs is that anyone can create their own tools for themselves, for their friends, for their family, or even run their business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you know, the models now can generate a lot of front-end code, and then you can render that code inside the canvas and then iterate on that and have much more visual representation of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, on Twitter, I've seen a lot of people creating, like, very, very personalized and customized tools that they really, really want, even, like, games like chess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And with recent image and, uh, image generation model from, um, open AI, you can literally sketch anything, um, on, with your own hands and then recreate or kind of realize what you're dreaming of, uh, in, within, in image and in the style that you really, really want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, I do really hope that the creativity, the human creativity, and how AI tools can help anyone to become creatives or be an artist, um, in a way that was not possible before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that I've tried actually on the mobile is to create a mini game, um, and you can easily do that in Canvas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I asked to just, like, generate me, you know, a React app of an interesting game because I'm the plane, and then the model does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do hope that in the future, instead of me prompting it to generate a game, it will kind of, like, be more proactive and have this kind of personalization, um, as AI become more of a companion to humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, uh, an exciting thing, um, about CHPT is that the compositionality of different capabilities that can allow you to augment, like, human creativity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here I can, I asked, um, to generate an image of the UI and then, uh, sorry, um, generate an image of the UI and then ask the model to kind of implement this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can do that literally in Canvas right now and, like, it can render, it's not, um, it's just a front-end, it doesn't have full kind of stack engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but, you know, you can do some of the things like this, you can compose different tools and compose in a way that was never possible before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I do hope that ideas like this will be very, very powerful and everybody in this room can play with those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and actually, how did we get there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there are, like, two main scaling paradigms that helped us to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one is next token prediction, obviously, if we use a pre-training scaling paradigm, um, where the model kind of becomes, like, a world-building machine understanding the world in a much better scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, but it becomes, the next token prediction, uh, works really, really good at certain tasks, but it becomes harder at tasks like writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If the model predicts a wrong next token, it can kind of, the coherence of the plot will just be lost in the pertaining stage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe you kind of want to recover this in reinforcement learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the next second paradigm that has happened, um, is, um, RL on a chain of thought for more complex, uh, tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the reasoning work from OpenAI, and now it's being adopted by a lot of different labs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, I do think this is scaling RL in itself is another paradigm that we can train the models on the axis, um, to, and especially for the real world's tasks that was never possible before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all the agentic work, um, agents like Operator, Deep Research, um, other agents are kind of, like, trained on this kind of new paradigm overall on the chain of thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, yeah, I, I, I want to, like, uh, finish this section of, like, vignette of, like, yeah, build, create, build, and make something wonderful in this world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I hope, like, people be more inspired rather than scared that AI is going to take their jobs or kind of remove their creativity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, I feel like people can become more powerful with, with their imaginations with these tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I currently work at OpenAI, before that I worked at Anthropic, and, um, I was kind of, like, at the intersection of product and research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I first came to Anthropic, I was a product engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, over time, I switched to research engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, my background is mostly both in product and research now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I've learned over and over across different projects is that there are two kind of main ways of building research-driven products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the first one, um, is when you have unfamiliar capability of the model, your job might be to create familiar form factor for that unfamiliar capability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, in examples of that could be, um, you know, ChatGPT was like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, a hundred contacts from Quad was like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I'll share, let's dive deeper into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, the early prototypes that I've done before joining AnyLab was actually working with Clip, um, which is a contrastive model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, it's, like, image, um, text-to-image, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, I fine-tuned Clip a little bit on the images that I was excited about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is the prototype of, you know, fashion search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think some people, you know, people kind of, like, it went viral on Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like that's because people really found some usefulness if you bring some, like, Clip technology into some form factor that people will like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, um, I think a lot of the product work is around like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, if the model has a certain capability that was never possible before, how do we create this new, um, form factor?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The same happened with a hundred key context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When Claude, um, started being able to, you know, consume the entire books, um, you can imagine to have various form factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">File uploads is just, like, very general and something really familiar to people that can just, like, dump the entire document into Claude and ask follow-up questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can imagine other form factors for this, like infinite chats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in a way it's, like, infinite memory, um, as a way to kind of, like, take this a hundred key context into some form factor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can, like, exercise this product thinking by, um, thinking of, like, novel ways that people can interact, um, with this novel technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, another example, this is more speculative, it wasn't deployed anywhere, um, is if the model has kind of a sense of self-calibration, uh, uh, or, um, it's also called P, I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If the model knows the confidence of the answer that it knows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if I'm really, really confident in this claim and then my confidence may be, uh, 85%, then maybe there is a way for the interface to highlight that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, maybe the, um, more highlighted versions is much more confident, um, kind of, much more confident, uh, claims and less highlighted as, um, kind of less, less, uh, uh, confidence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in a way you can imagine if the model, yeah, you can, like, think of, okay, if, if you train the model to be really good at, like, self-calibration, how do we then represent that to the humans?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if, if anything, will it be useful, um, for humans?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Same happened with, uh, when we were trying to deploy a one preview, um, the chain of thought itself is a very alien thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, a lot of people were, okay, how do you bring along humans with models thinking, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If the model, if, if the human needs to wait for chain of thought for, like, two minutes or five minutes, that's kind of boring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, people don't, I think it's just like more of a, how would people perceive the model thoughts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and one thing that we did, uh, is actually we wanted to create the streaming, uh, kind of interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so the model would always stream its thoughts ephemeral, um, and we trained the model to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, in a way there was chain of thought as an alien technology, as an alien artifact of the model, and then trying to figure out, like, how do we best bring to the humans, um, is another way of thinking of, uh, building product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so another way, the second way of building research, um, during products is actually start with a deep belief in what you want to make, um, with either from a product perspective or, um, kind of like vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and literally make the model do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I feel like this is more of a common thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so we can go through some examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, before Antarctic, I worked at the New York Times, and, uh, in a lot of ways, we were thinking about how to represent information, uh, to people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, how do we add the layer of context to the product and coverage?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at that time, we were all working on, like, elections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, uh, we only had tools like NLP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can imagine this idea, this concept could have extended, given the current tools of AI, to have much more dynamic, um, representation or dynamic UIs that people could, um, consume the content better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Same when I was working on this, um, product, uh, the command line, the terminal, the new terminal, uh, I think it would be much, much richer if you could have integrated auto-completion or some of the benefits of GPT-3 at that time, um, into the product itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so if you wanted to have, it was a vision of, like, having much more humane command line for people to, for junior engineers to actually, um, be more well-equipped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, and then, like, early prototypes around, uh, with GPT-3, even though it was just next token prediction, um, how do I make a writing IDE, uh, with GPT-3?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at that time, it was just, you know, trying to, um, whenever I type, it would auto-complete my thoughts, almost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those ideas were kind of present early days with the technology that was coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and yeah, and I feel like when I was at Anthropica, I kind of realized that, and actually, if you want to create, like, new interaction paradigm of interfaces, you actually need to train the model, um, for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, another example of what we did with Claude, which I don't think a lot of people know, um, is when Claude generates titles, it actually has some micropersonalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it takes the style, uh, the writing style of the user, and then generates a title in the same style of the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine certain, like, interesting micropersonalization that you could create, um, within the products themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, um, another project was Claude and Slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the vision of Claude becoming a first virtual teammate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was back in 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, you know, Slack was a very, very natural workspace where people collaborate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you can, you know, imagine a Claude model to be able to jump into the threads and suggest new things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or sometimes, um, you know, Claude was really, really good at, uh, summarizing the, what's, what went, what's going on in, within this channel at the high volume content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so this was the first kind of vision and the first attempt of making Claude being a virtual super assistant, being, and being able to, like, use different tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, my first, one of the first projects at OpenAI was around Canvas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so that was, you know, that was in the same spirit of breaking out from the chat interface to something different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we wanted to create, um, much more human AI collaborative and flexible affordance that will scale, uh, with new modalities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Canvas is not just, like, a thing that you can write into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also a thing that the model can write into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the model can render a code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And another model can check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can, like, create, like, the interfaces that will scale with new model capabilities and other tools that will happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one thing, one interesting thing, um, about Canvas is that we actually postchained the model purely on synthetic data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you know, we live in the age where, um, a lot of most powerful reasoning models, um, can be distilled via APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this, like, distillation is a very powerful idea, uh, of having a student and teacher and have a teacher, um, to teach things to a smaller model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we've trained, um, you know, this model to become more of a collaborator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what does it mean for a model to become a collaborator?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do we actually make evals for this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, one thing that we wanted to kind of decompose is that teaching the model to use a tool is kind of different behavior from, uh, having a model to be proactive or act as a collaborator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, teaching a tool in itself is also have a nuanced kind of behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one thing that we, um, had to calibrate the model on is when to entirely rewrite the document versus when to, uh, if you look at the canvas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes the model can just specifically select sections and delete those and rewrite them, uh, in a much more fine-grained way instead of, like, rewriting everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, when, um, you know, to create, uh, code in canvas versus, um, ask, like, a python tool call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's like different tools, compositionality, um, is happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's a lot of work around, um, teaching the behaviors for the models for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and you have, you can employ different, um, techniques for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can, I can share a little bit more, uh, how we did this cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, another project that we did was, uh, it's called tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, everybody is familiar with the idea of having reminders or to-do lists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, the model can now maybe schedule tasks for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, but the most important thing about it is, is the tasks itself is very, very diverse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not just, you know, just a reminder of your to-do list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It can create stories for you every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, it can continue as a story, uh, from the previous day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can imagine this, like, the modularity of two compositions, but it's very powerful in product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's go to the case study of the model behavior in more specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, I really want to, like, dive deep into the idea of the model behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, how do we shape the models and why, how do you post-train the models on the behaviors that we want?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, you know, I think to be more specific and be grounded in the real world, uh, use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll share more, uh, how we might want to think about shaping the, um, kind of behavior of the model, uh, around refusals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, let's, let's have, we, we, it's also like the second way of making the product where we have this, um, kind of vision of how the model should behave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that vision is also grounded by the, you know, cross-functional collaboration between different teams on how we want the model to respond to various users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, one particular thing that you can imagine is, like, the model should have more opinions, but with caveats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just you have opinions, but with caveats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what does it mean, actually?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the model maybe needs to be more decisive, um, when asked direct questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, let's say one thing that we've seen with RLHF is that the model is very sycophantic back, like, early days in, like, 2022, 2023.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If the model would just agree with everything you would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, how do we actually teach the model to be more not to do that and be more nuanced?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, another thing that was annoying, uh, is, is that, like, the model says, I don't actually have a point of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, uh, is just, just willing to chat with people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, maybe the model should have some views on certain things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then sometimes the model could indicate when, when things are just opinions, um, and notes its own biases and inconsistencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it should acknowledge, kind of have, like, self-knowledge of what it knows and what it thinks is right or not right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the model, like, back in 2022, cloud 1.3, uh, didn't really have, like, any thoughtful responses for things like philosophy, uh, like, ethical questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, you can imagine to post-chain the model, um, on the behavior that would be much more nuanced than the philosophical questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, other behaviors that you might want to encode in your model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you kind of, like, list out all the various things that you would like a model to behave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, maybe, like, the model can have better knowledge of who it is and what it's capable of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, because we've seen in the product a lot of people just, like, ask the model about its features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And oftentimes it doesn't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, let's dive deep into the, uh, more specific example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, cloud 2.1, I don't know if anybody remembers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but when it was launched, I think it was, um, kind of had the issue of, like, over-refusals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, 2.1 would refuse tasks that superficially sounded harmful, but actually were not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you know, it wasn't just caused by a single source of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so we had to, like, investigate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, you know, we knew that it was fixable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because for some reason, something was 2.1 led to some refusals on benign prompts, then 2.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you kind of have, like, a really good baseline for experimentation and debugging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, the way you debug the model behavior is actually very similar to how you would want to debug software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, um, and the way we would approach this is, um, okay, how do we actually craft this Monion's refusals?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so the first principles that they had is, like, maybe the model should assume charitable interpretation of what the person is asking without being harmful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so instead of, you know, crafted dialogue between two characters who are planning a complex heist, the model would refuse because it's not comfortable with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the model should have much more charitable interpretation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, this is a creative writing prompt, so probably it should respond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and other principles that we've kind of, like, thought about is, like, how do we actually use non-verbal communication, non-violent communication principles?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, maybe the model should, um, refuse, um, more, like, I statements instead of, and take responsibility for its own refusal instead of saying U statements or any judgment to the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, ask if the user would be willing to make some changes, so Claude can be more comfortable with its boundaries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's another kind of, like, very nuanced behavior we wanted to teach the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, you know, then the model needs to know what its boundaries are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and this is, like, much more of a matter, kind of, post-training learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, and also, like, acknowledges impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I know this may be annoying to you, and this is, like, much more empathetic answer than saying, you know, um, I don't want to respond to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then, you know, I think we've kind of came up with different, like, refusal taxonomy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are, like, benign, uh, over-refusals on, like, homeless prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there were creative writing of refusals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, uh, there are actually some of the interesting refusals were around, um, tool calls or function calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it might have access, uh, had a tool to view a note, but actually would say, I can't see your notes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and why is this happening?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, other, yeah, other, uh, taxonomies of refusals at that time was, like, you know, long document attachments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If I upload the document, it would just say, like, I don't have a capability to read this document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so something in the data might have been causing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and misdirected refusals, um, when they, um, you know, it kind of, like, took interpretation, um, of the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it should have had, like, much more charitable, charitable view of the user during, um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you kind of construct this, like, categories, um, of various refusals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, if it's in every behavior or, like, a capability that you want to, like, post in the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you have, like, various use cases and various edge cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you kind of want to be approached for some more nuance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, yeah, like, so the first thing in every research project is, like, how do you actually, what evals do we build to trust?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, what evals do we build to trust?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and there are, um, for subjective things like this, or for class, obviously, evals for certain tasks, class of tasks, like math, would be very, very different from what is here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, in terms of refusals, um, how did we construct the evals?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first, it's, like, product of Flywheel, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we have all the users and manually collected prompts that wouldn't use refusals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, we can also, like, send data to generate diverse prompts on the borderline between harmfulness and helpfulness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are prompts are around, like, creative writing, um, like, edgy creative writing, as we call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and you can also use other evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You kind of want to construct a suite of evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like, X-test was, like, 200 non-malicious prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, wild chat data set, um, a collection of diverse user chatbot interactions with ambiguous requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Topic switching political discussions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can also, um, use some of the open source benchmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, like, general approaches, not particularly what has happened with cloud, but, like, more of a general approach to the model behavior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">frustrating is that, you know, you kind of want to, like, look at the data, clean up the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you might want to consider either, like, collect targeted human feedback collection for supervised fine-tuning or preference modeling, reward modeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you might not want to do that because human feedback is very costly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, especially with reasoning models, um, right, you might want to just not have any human feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And control was, like, synthetically generating some of the behavioral changes, uh, like a preference data to trained reward models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and do RL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think, uh, at that time, you know, I think this is, like, more employing, uh, constitutional AI, uh, principles of those, uh, anti-refusal behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And create a preference data, where you only change one particular feature within your pairs, let's say, of preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You only want to control, um, one change that, in that pair, uh, to have much more control over the reward model data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you can, like, the dumbest, simplest thing that you can do is, like, take, um, a preference, like, take a response from model A and take a response from model B and prefer B over A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, um, it doesn't necessarily reduce, um, or fix the spurious features that the model will learn that you don't actually want to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so you kind of want to craft this distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, so this is mostly around, like, crafting the distribution of the data that you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and actually, yeah, look at the data, like, you would debug software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, each refusal might be caused by different data sets, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's, like, a tool called refusal, maybe it came from some kind of self-knowledge data that it would teach that the model doesn't have a physical body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, uh, the model might just refuse to set an alarm, um, because it doesn't have a physical body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, it does have a tool to set an alarm, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it has some of this contradictory data that might affect weird model behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, also, like, long dog refusal like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it was creative writing few results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, like, more of a, this balanced, um, challenging act between, like, safety and harmfulness, uh, data and helpfulness data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, in cloud three model, Carvey actually, uh, wrote everything about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, models that are trained to be more helpful and responsive to user requests may also lean towards harmful behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, sharing information that violates the policy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, conversely, when models just over-indexed on homelessness can tend towards not sharing any new information with users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which, in itself, makes the model very unusable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, navigating this balancing act is very challenging, um, and works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, and this is the plot of, uh, what we did and the results of cloud 2.1 and cloud 3 at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, yeah, like, you, kind of, want to, like, web check, uh, the responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, when we asked the draft, like, fictional science sci-fi novel about surveillance system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, 3 would respond in the match manual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will respond instead of, like, um, refusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Same here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah, mostly for creative writing, um, um, tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, my third section, um, of the talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, before we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Before I jump into this, um, I would love to invite you if anybody has any questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, um, I don't want to, like, mumble all along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, anything I can just move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.000</a></span> | <span

what's your process that you guys follow in order to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">see how some new thing you're trying to push out, like, how do you go from wanting that particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">teacher or behavior to actually, like, inducing that into models?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, like, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, it's, um, it's, um, it's supposed to do all of the risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, you might want to, um, you know, if this is your project, then you might want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">think of what kind of data you want to collect and how you would want to collect the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, uh, you can take, like, uh, the base config or, um, train a model, um, the same way as,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, let's say you want to make a change in, like, 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You might want to take the 4.0 model and add your data change and then retrain the model again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then see the effect on the evals that you will build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there are other much more cheaper approaches, um, like, incremental, like, training on top of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">um, the 4.0, let's say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, using either SFT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2033" target="_blank">00:33:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, some of the choices that you will have to make is either you want to change in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">um, like, supervised fine-tuning, uh, stage or you might want to have retrained reward model or,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">um, create a new kind of, like, evaluator grader, um, for that particular task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can, like, create prompts in a raw environment and then, um, exercise those, um, exercise that scale for the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then see if the model learns over the course of training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it doesn't, um, you know, you then look at the bunch of, like, plots and, you know, your plot might go up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but maybe some other plots might go down, so you kind of want to, like, calibrate, um, and fix those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, yeah, it's a very complex, um, as more and more tools and as more things we teach the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it becomes much more, uh, kind of uncontrollable, almost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the third section is more about, um, the point that how you construct a raw environment and rewards is how your product will work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, I think real-world use cases is what creates the complexity of a raw environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the complexity comes from, you know, teaching the model to complete hard tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And oftentimes hard tasks are, require much more than just answering the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They require tools like search, um, code tools, uh, computer use tools, uh, reasoning over a long context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and kind of like reward design that you want to shape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I think maybe it's obvious, maybe it's not obvious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2142" target="_blank">00:35:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's say, you know, as we teach the models, for the model to become very useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we actually need to teach the models on useful things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you can think of like, uh, let's say we want to teach the model to be, uh, like a soft engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, okay, what does it actually mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean it like creates really good PRs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then your task distribution will be on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do you evaluate what is a good PR?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is not good PR?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, is actually, isn't itself more of a, can be also like a product thinking work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, same, um, you can dive deeper into the creative storyteller, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you want to teach the model to be, uh, good at writing, actually, what does it mean for a human to be a good writer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, they actually need some kind of tool to draft and edit their thoughts and like have multiple days to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2196" target="_blank">00:36:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe the model should be able to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, maybe the model should have a tool that where you can like edit and draft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And oftentimes for creatives, you know, people go observe the world for like a long, like sometimes they like connect the dot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like the dots are getting connected in the very random times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe you want to expose the model to never ending, uh, kind of search engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the model should be able to always have access to the latest state of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and then, um, maybe over the course of let's say a week of being exposed to latest thing that is happening in the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the model can start reflecting on the world and like write something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and maybe that's like much more natural process of writing than just like ask or prompt it, like write about X, Y, Z.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and we are shifting towards much more, uh, more complex, uh, kind of interactions within their all environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the multiplayer interactions, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just one user communicates with one model, but it might be the case that multiple users, multiplayer collaboration that can happen with a model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I'm a, um, product designer and your product manager, we collaborating on something and we want to collaborate with an agent to, um, make a new product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this in itself is a task that you can learn in RL, but each user has different preferences and each user is, has different, um, things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, how do you construct this environment is actually important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, uh, you know, multi-agentic environments is, um, more of, uh, the model debate with each other or deliberate on like certain topic to reach a conclusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can construct, um, I, I think like multi-agentic is like more, more like AlphaGo, like, uh, kind of environments, um, where they, they like get reward by achieving something, um, together, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, um, I think in AI labs, I feel like we are also shifting, um, possibly the focus from, because we, we kind of like optimized so much around the, uh, class of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're shifting the focus on the, uh, class of tasks that is like really easy to measure, like within like math, uh, competitive programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're shifting the focus maybe towards more subjective class of tasks that is really, really hard to measure, but that are becoming much more important if AI models get socially integrated in our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2347" target="_blank">00:39:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and more specifically, let's say emotional intelligence, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The humans who use chat GPT, uh, use it so much for things like coaching therapy, uh, emotional, but we don't actually have much open source evals on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do we actually measure that is actually becomes much more interesting question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like social intelligence in voice, voice mode, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's one thing for a model to be intelligent in reason, like math and it's reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing, but another axis of intelligence is when I talk to a model in voice, uh, it can actually suggest something really meaningful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It might just say like, Hey, I noticed you did X, Y, Z, maybe I should create, um, a new tool for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's a different kind of like, uh, social, like intelligence in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, another cause of tasks that I'm interested in is, uh, writing, obviously I think, um, models, creativity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, writing is like really hard to measure because it's so personal and subjective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but it's interesting to think about, uh, can we make those tasks a bit more objective?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, everybody loves or like some kind of like sci-fi novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2423" target="_blank">00:40:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What makes it really, really good?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2425" target="_blank">00:40:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so maybe there are certain like rules, technological rules or consistency of the world, um, that people really like or the character development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can like decompose, um, those subjective tasks into much more objective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2439" target="_blank">00:40:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Same with like visual design and aesthetics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and for the model to generate something really aesthetically interesting, um, it should know like the basic principles of good visual design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are like much more objective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2455" target="_blank">00:40:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2457" target="_blank">00:40:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think like, this is more of a kind of new, new kind of product research that a lot of people are starting doing is creating new RL tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is more of a simulation of real world scenarios, um, leveraging in context learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to teach like a new tool or something, um, leveraging synthetic data, wide distillation from stronger reasoning models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2480" target="_blank">00:41:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, you can think of like inventing new model behavior and interactions like multiplayer and also incorporating product and user feedback, uh, during the entire process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, another axis of this work is actually around reward design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, how do we teach the model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like what kind of feedback would I want to give to a model so that it will learn how to better operate in this real world scenario use case and be more adapt in social contexts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually this is, this requires a real quite deep product thinking, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to teach the model, um, to have like follow up, like meaningful follow up questions, but not like overly being annoying or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so how do you reward for completing a tasks in a way that makes, that will make a lot of sense in the product and will shape, um, the product experience with the user in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and obviously during that process you will get into, uh, VR things like, do you have a question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just curious, you guys thinking about like, kind of infer the rewards from the data from like a certain group of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess they will have some like internal reward, you know, like the mechanism to make decisions and then you can use that to sort of, you know, to inject such a insight into a model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2574" target="_blank">00:42:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think there are definitely various approaches to how you construct the reward, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there was one, um, you can construct very simple rewards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also like train a reward model, um, that will, as yeah, you can like train like some kind of like inverse, um, reward modeling, um, tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it depends on the tasks too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it depends on the, like what kind of thing that you want to like optimize the model for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2603" target="_blank">00:43:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, and, um, I think an interesting, um, thing that you will discover during this entire process is, uh, reward hacks, which is very, very common in RL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are many, many different reasons why it's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually really highly recommend to read Lillian's blog about reward hacking in RL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2626" target="_blank">00:43:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very comprehensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there's, uh, reward hacking is basically when, um, the model achieves high reward for, uh, things that it actually didn't do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's kind of deceived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and especially right now as more and more systems, we use other AI models, LLMs to be evaluators for policy models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually an interesting, the most common like reward hack is when a policy model tries to deceive, uh, to think that it, deceive the evaluator model such that it will think that the policy completed the task or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, here's, um, an example of like the code patch tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the model is like, to skip all the tests, you can define this function that always skips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and then it passes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and it's mostly interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a paper, recent paper from OpenAI around, um, just like monitoring, uh, reasoning models for misbehavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And interesting finding is that if you, you actually don't want to optimize chain of thought, uh, on being,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">using, because then the model will be much more kind of hide it in its intent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so yeah, it's like very interesting paper on like reward hacks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially with like more complex reasoning models, the complexity of reward hacks will also, um, change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and especially, let's say in the software engineer, and you might not want to know what kind of code changed, uh, it made in order to create some certain vulnerability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So you need actually, um, more, um, create like new affordances to have like much higher, like much more trustworthy verification of the model outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and this is like more of an alignment problem too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I'm almost done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is the fourth section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's more like vignettes, uh, and the future of human AI interactions is how I think, um, about things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, obviously I made this graph like a year ago and nobody cares about MLU anymore, but I think this is to communicate the fact that the cost of reasoning is drastically decreasing and it will only just be decreasing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and this idea of like raw intelligence in itself has just become so cheap that I think anybody can create like really useful and really amazing things with those models, um, at pretty much low cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, I, yeah, as I mentioned before, it's like, um, when we are entering the age where it's really hard to verify AI outputs because I'm not an expert in let's say medical, um, or financial analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2793" target="_blank">00:46:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like how do we actually teach create like new affordances for humans to verify or edit models outputs, um, and help them to teach the models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I do think there's a cool future of like dynamic generative UI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's kind of like invisible software creation on the fly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you talk to a model and, uh, you know, I say like, I want to learn more about the solar system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, instead of right now, the model will just like output text, but I would want to believe that in the future, uh, it would be much more personalized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say I'm a visual thinker and you are more of a listener.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you're a listener, it will create maybe a podcast, but if I'm a visual, um, person, it might want to create me a picture or, you know, um, like a 3G, a 3GS visualization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this idea of like, uh, this interface is like ephemeral and it's like self morphs depends on understanding your intent and your context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's like deeply personal personalized models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, I'm also excited about personalized access to healthcare and education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think it's really, um, incredible, um, that anybody can check the symptoms and with chat or something and get like some advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and also like with that also comes like some of the interesting like consumer hardware, um, in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, uh, lastly is like our relationship to the process of storytelling will forever change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the way we tell the stories, the way we'll create new novels, maybe co-writing with like, with models, co-scripting new films.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I don't think like, I think there will be the new generation of creative people who, um, will change our relationship with storytelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would hope to think that the current creators don't, are not scared of the eye and more open minded to use those tools for their process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2934"

target="_blank">00:48:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So thanks Karina for the very interesting talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so yeah, now we'll open the floor to questions, a Q and A session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, we'll structure it more openly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2945" target="_blank">00:49:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So anything you want to ask her about, um, research products, um, things that opening high, um, that she can talk about and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2954" target="_blank">00:49:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for the folks on zoom, feel free to ask questions in the chat.</span></div><div

questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

law?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, like, there aren't any shorts on it right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, things that are really a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there's, like, not enough people who wish they were not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">Um, yeah, like, um, a lot of researchers are, uh, I think, I think, yeah, creative writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think, like, anybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

creative writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think, like, anybody, um, yeah, like, um, like, um, a lot of researchers are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really, like, um, working on problems where it's very easy to evaluate, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I think there is a class of problems that is, like, subjective tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there's no open, like, frontier benchmark for creative writing or emotional intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, right, but you can construct one if you want to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, we can, like, brainstorm if that's helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is like, do you think about like ROI working on things that are easy to evaluate? Like you can move much faster. How do you consider things that are more subjective? So you can't move as fast, but they're also important. Like would it be better to just take all these and put them on the things that aren't objective and you can move very fast?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3038" target="_blank">00:50:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think moving fast though is also as tasks becomes like much more complex, as we kind of like optimized everything out from kind of easy tasks. Now we kind of want to like teach the models for more low, like longer horizon tasks of software engineering or kind of automating like AI research, right? This in itself as a very hard tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, you have like kind of have some milestones. Maybe you can create benchmarks to hit those milestones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3070" target="_blank">00:51:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I do think this is like, you know, I think like this is all solvable things. And I don't think people should be worried about like moving fast versus like slow, because I feel like everything is moving fast these days. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were to build a startup right now, what startup would you do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I had, I mean, I was thinking about building a startup before joining Anthropic with that project was into Alia. Um, well, let's see, I actually really, like one thing that I recently told someone is like, I would actually build something around like particle collider, I don't know, or bio tech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, like, I don't think we need larger particle collider than CERN, then somebody should be building one. Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I feel like, uh, the models would be able to build any product that you imagine. Um, yeah, sure. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think are the major bottlenecks for your team or, um, for OpenAI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I don't know, it is, it is, yeah. Um, the bottlenecks are, oh, the question is, what's the major bottlenecks, uh, for OpenAI? Um, I don't know, I'm not sure if, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">faster execution should be solved with more people versus, um, like using AIs now to, to help us move faster, if that makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So I feel like that's the bottleneck. I think there was a lot of, I think right now we are like in the middle of figuring a lot of things out in order to like, like, I feel like in a year or two, that will accelerate us so much more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like infrastructure is actually one of the major bottlenecks, right? If you don't build infrastructure with, uh, multimodal, like as a first class citizen, then, um, obviously all the multimodal things will be much more, um, slow, like, um, more difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, yeah, in a way it's like infra, um, um, figuring out like what to prioritize at a given time, because sometimes you can say yes to everything and then not having a focus time is also a thing, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, basically when the model checks the turns context and updates how you should score the same parameter based on that turn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Wait, um, I'm a little bit confused by this question. Um, I think generally like rubric based grading is, um, very powerful and, um, you know, as long as you optimize, um, things that you want to optimize and there's no reward hacks, then it's good. Um, how do you imagine AI will be used by creatives?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">If not just generating entire works on their own, how will they be integrated in their creatives flow?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, um, I think, you know, I think AI is, is just like right now, maybe it's more like you would use Figma or like tools like Adobe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I think in the future, it's more, um, maybe it will be much more co-creation with an AI rather than using it as a tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, maybe we have like live brainstorming and create things on the fly and then publish it together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like much more companion, um, work. Cool. Other questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Other questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, tasks that are not captured by road models?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like how do you capture?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That cannot be captured? Um, I mean, I can't think of any because, um, the way you can, uh, the way you teach the road model is based on some of the human preferences maybe, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3323" target="_blank">00:55:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like pairwise comparisons. So essentially you can almost teach anything, uh, to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I do think the complexity will, like the complexity always arises with like tools, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3336" target="_blank">00:55:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, if you give very complicated tool, um, then you might want to be, like the learning is like much more difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I feel like, um, I do hope that almost anything can be teachable in a row. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so I'm curious, like, now that you bring up like the learning of the frequency, how do you prevent the model from converging to like the main, like, frequency level?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like Airbnb listings all looking the same. Like, how do you inject some creative diversity?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3370" target="_blank">00:56:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think this is an interesting question. I think they, uh, the, the two ways, um, like what's talking on my mind is, um, how do you preserve entity from the base model, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, uh, base models are super diverse because they can literally elicit any human preference or, um, a human thought. Um, so how do you, um, you know, yeah, preserve the entity from the base model during the role?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And another way, um, is, uh, the, the reason why we love our layoff, like reinforcement learning from AI feedback and create synthetic generations of pairwise comparisons, let's say, is because it can induce the diversity that you really want to teach on like distribution that you care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3416" target="_blank">00:56:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, that is not like the mean average consumer. Um, yeah, because sometimes like, you know, um, average human can prefer certain emojis or markdown, but actually you don't want the model to behave like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a way you can discourage the model from doing that. Um, yeah. So I feel like synthetic curation, like synthetic data generation is mostly like curation of, um, that kind of diversity. Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3445" target="_blank">00:57:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, I think it's qualitative, especially for the model behavior, like refusals. Um, Oh, um, how do I distill this question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, um, how do I distill this question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3472" target="_blank">00:57:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah. Like how do you capture like models limitations on something automatic versus a home manual? Um, I think there was a lot of benefit of literally playing with the model and, uh, look at the outputs and see what are the weirdnesses it has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there are definitely like, um, maybe more automatic checks, uh, and those are mostly like evals, right. Um, but, um, and maybe you have an eval that specifically checks with the behavior that you really don't want. Um, and that might be helpful, but a lot of nuanced weirdnesses that, um, like, did you realize is like through kind of like manual. And, and like, um, and that might be helpful. But a lot of nuanced weirdnesses that, um, like, did you realize is like through kind of like manual. And, and like, um, and that might be helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and like, um, another thing is like the model should be consistently behaving like this because if it's just like one off, then it's fine. But if the model consistently exhibits this behavior, then, uh, this becomes like a more problematic thing. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned in one of your slides are a huge tosses coming down. Um, but also, you know, it's kind of subjective creative dimension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like creating a whole visual interface or something. Arguably complexity of the problems, uh, increases. Do you think that, you know, for those problems, compute is still pretty much a whole limitation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do you think that we're kind of getting to this point where, uh, that improvement is going to be improvement to the models or data sets?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3561" target="_blank">00:59:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think that computer efficiency is important. I think that with more test time compute, generally the assumption is, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">um, the model can always get better and better. So it might achieve kind of human level of visual design, but can it just invent new interaction paradigms, like new interaction patterns?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like that's more of a superhuman skill. Um, and I do hope that with more compute, um, it will do that at some point. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3601" target="_blank">01:00:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can actually, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you can actually, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3607" target="_blank">01:00:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3608" target="_blank">01:00:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you verify it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, well, the thing with synthetic data is that you don't actually need to generate a lot of it, right? Um, so you can actually have like very much like manual inspection of what's going on. Um, obviously you can think of other methods, like, um, ask a human laborer, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to check the work, um, you can also ask, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you can also ask another model if that model is like very well covered. So it's like much, it becomes a more like meta thing. Maybe you can see a lot of it. Um, you can actually have like very much manual inspection of what's going on. Um, obviously you can think of other methods, like, um, ask a human laborers to check the work. Um, you can also ask another model if that model is like very well covered. So it's like much, it becomes a more like meta thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you can have a meta eval for that model to verify what you want to like verify. Um, and I think we are kind of entering those types of tasks too. Um, but the thing with synthetic data, um, and the data itself is like maybe you don't need as much. Um, and I think we are kind of entering those types of tasks too. Um, but the thing with synthetic data, um, and the data itself is like maybe you don't need as much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, what's important really is diversity and, um, yeah, diversity. Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3674" target="_blank">01:01:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Just a follow-up question to that. What do you think about like the diversity and quality tool? So there's like been like recent code generation covers where it's like, um, well, they put instruction diversity as like, um, they prioritize it more than code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, yeah, I think it's, um, it actually depends so much on like, like task and what you're trying to do. Sometimes synthetic data, uh, like a lot, if you like, if synthetic data happens to collapse certain mode and then it will like actually be hurting, uh, your training. But if synthetic data happens to collapse certain mode and then it will like actually be hurting, uh, your training. But if synthetic data happens to collapse certain mode and then it will like actually be hurting, uh, your training. But if synthetic data happens to collapse certain mode and then it will like actually be hurting, uh, your training. But if synthetic data happens to collapse certain mode and then it will actually be hurting, uh, your training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, your training. But if synthetic data is actually, um, diverse, it might actually at scale, if you do a lot of URL on this, it might just like recover from this. Um, yeah. Yeah. It's hard to give you the right answer. Cause it depends. Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Another question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for, um, so I have a question that's about making money, I guess. So, um, okay. It's a real question though. Uh, like we all know that, um, serving large language models is expensive, especially at the scale that, uh, you know, OpenAI and Thropic are doing. Uh, and my impression has been that, uh, at the current stage, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3773" target="_blank">01:02:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">um, it's actually losing money to, uh, you know, serve all these models, uh, to produce the products. Uh, is that true? Or, uh, what, what's being done to, to, I guess, bring down the cost?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3791" target="_blank">01:03:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah. I mean, I think, uh, for a developer, um, I think, I don't think like, I, I, I don't know. I think it's the question for Sam, whether we are losing money or not. But, um, I do think that the, like the generality of the technology is like so wide that, um, you know, I don't think, I think about like how to make money in, on a regular basis. I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3819" target="_blank">01:03:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But, um, yeah, as a developer, let's say, uh, and if you're using all the tools, you actually don't need to like create a, like foundation model now. Like you can just use, uh, like very inexpensive, like, very like open, like deep seek is like very interesting results, right? So you can have, you can like bootstrap from existing research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's harder to be at the frontier because you kind of need to like invent and that might be expensive. Like when you invent something new, it's always inefficient. It's always expensive. But, um, actually it was every technological innovation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3854" target="_blank">01:04:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, then what comes next, the second innovation is, uh, how do we bring down the cost of the thing that, that happened, right? And this is what's happening in AI too. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3867" target="_blank">01:04:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can create an amazing product and this is how you make money. Yeah, that's, that's a good answer. Uh, just quickly following up. So, um, is most of the cost reduction coming from like infrastructure improvements or can better models or better algorithms also, uh, contribute to lower costs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3889" target="_blank">01:04:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, lower costs. Yeah. I mean like, uh, lowering costs, but, um, I think it's, um, the costs of production, maybe just, you know, the cost of production of the model training itself might go down. Um, like it's, um, the training process in itself, um, might be not as costly anymore, but obviously, uh, we scale a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3915" target="_blank">01:05:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like scale. Yeah. It's very much like in linear relationship, like scaling and compute. I think it's just like, yeah, it's hard to know. I'm sorry. I didn't have an answer to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

I do think like, um, future AIs will be building data centers, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3941" target="_blank">01:05:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">um, to all like, um, or how are the current alums in robotics. I think I've, I've read like, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3949" target="_blank">01:05:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">um, PI, um, the company by Sergey Lemon, like the paper, they using a lot of like RLHF or like RL, uh, for robotics tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3960" target="_blank">01:06:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, obviously I feel like data is a huge limitation and bottleneck. Um, but I think as long as you solve that, um, I think it would be really amazing. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3970" target="_blank">01:06:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I'm very hopeful and very, yeah, excited about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3977" target="_blank">01:06:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, hi. So you mentioned you work, uh, in both product and research. So I'm interested in, um, from the developer or the researcher point of view, uh, Anthropic and OpenAI. Um, what's the visibility for you into other components of the model and how easy is it for you to learn?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=3999" target="_blank">01:06:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">For you to learn, say the pre-training of GPT, why you are like responsible for part of the post-training?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4006" target="_blank">01:06:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah. Um, well, I mostly worked on post-training side of things. Um, obviously pre-training, um, obviously you just cannot run like pre-training on your own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to like be a part of like the next big, uh, like training or something. So that's like part of the teams that you can join. And I think there's, um, good visibility in like those steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then sometimes you want to, you know, uh, contribute the datasets to them or, um, help with certain tasks that you're interested in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4042" target="_blank">01:07:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was curious, do you have any co-workers who are AIs right now? And do you use like agents in a kind of co-worker relationship right now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4049" target="_blank">01:07:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I don't think I have like an amazing product to be like this, right? I think I use Chai GPT on a regular basis. Is it my co-worker? Not really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4059" target="_blank">01:07:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like sometimes they ask like, what do you think? Yeah, it was like in Chai GPT. Like what I really want, uh, I don't know if people have used this product called Tuple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4070" target="_blank">01:07:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a pair programming, um, software, but then it's like, you can just call a model, um, and then share screen. And then the model can, um, just literally start like editing my code if I'm coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4086" target="_blank">01:08:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I can like highlight things and then the model can see it and change this as much more of a natural co-working, um, form factor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But no, like, I don't think we are, technology wise, like we are not there yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4103" target="_blank">01:08:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have any ideas for like what's missing and having an autonomous, like co-worker partner?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4108" target="_blank">01:08:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I mean, I've seen the cool, you know, demonstrations here. I think one of the paper like a year or two ago on just like simulating like a city of people and all that. Like what's the gap between that? And so like a peer that you could have on Slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4122" target="_blank">01:08:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I think the gap is actually social intelligence and like some of the human things, like being able to like in real time, um, like generate things that I'm asking and then also being smart about things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4137" target="_blank">01:08:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like maybe I want to coach too, but like will the model be able to like tell me instead of like, uh, taking agency from me, the model can just like guide, guide me through this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4149" target="_blank">01:09:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it depends on like how you want to form this relationship. It's like a really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4153" target="_blank">01:09:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So the model is, I feel like it's kind of limited by the social abilities. Does it make sense? Like I think that's missing, um, kind of like, um, speech to speech conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4164" target="_blank">01:09:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like can the model converse back with me in real time and then point to things that it talked about exactly at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4173" target="_blank">01:09:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like those type of, um, things that might need, might have possibly need like some other changes in like architecture and like multimodality things. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4185" target="_blank">01:09:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">In your experience, which is, which are the biggest differences between traditional product development?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4191" target="_blank">01:09:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a good question. Cause, um, I interned briefly at like companies like Dropbox or, um, Square and they may mainly very much like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4202" target="_blank">01:10:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">traditional software product development and they go through like this interesting life cycle of, okay, I have like PRD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4211" target="_blank">01:10:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I do this. I incentivize designer designers comes up with like UI's and then I asked software engineers to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4219" target="_blank">01:10:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we have two minutes, I believe. Um, yeah, but, uh, I think with research during products is actually comes from research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4229" target="_blank">01:10:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, like if the research has like an impressive demo, uh, of the model capability, um, maybe then, um, there is, um, then you shape the product around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and sometimes it's like both product and research come together from the very beginning and do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it just happened with the canvas for example. Yeah. When both product and research were together and there was like less, less of a process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4257" target="_blank">01:10:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like more of a ad hoc. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4259" target="_blank">01:10:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, for fundamental unverifiable domains like creative writing or visual art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, yeah, it's interesting. Um, I think, you know, nobody has tried it. I'm like, this, uh, this looks reasonable. Um, yeah, especially if creative writing, you have all the like competitions or prizes that people, uh, got from, um, their writing. So there's something in there. Um, someone who's still concerned with AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We're stepping into the creative space. Do you have any personal moral affliction on how your work is so powerful? And that was, um, I actually wrote a blog post about this. Um, I have a blog post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4309" target="_blank">01:11:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called in sub stack and the post is called moral progress. And I think you will find it interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4319" target="_blank">01:11:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So give, uh, give a hand again for, uh, Karina.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4322" target="_blank">01:12:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4324" target="_blank">01:12:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwiPrwUDJ8&t=4325" target="_blank">01:12:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
