you're your new presenter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">uh let's get to know about you and why you're interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">i i was working as a back-end engineer um my name is venki by the way nice to meet you all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">i took a sabbatical to do uh to understand like the current ecosystem and to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">experiment more uh with the ai tools and also understand the fundamentals a lot so i took a break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">uh i was um and then i'm trying to read papers but so far it's not working out for me the self-study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but i'm still like uh trying to make sure like i get something positive out of this sabbatical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">uh this is my this is my first time presenting the paper i'm i'm not sure like how it goes but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm hope uh i feel like i i put a lot of attention to understand the details because i'm presenting it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise i would usually skip through them skip through them yeah so it's a good good uh a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like a decision for me to volunteer for this agreed okay uh if you want you can make your paper full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">screen and then we can get into it okay yeah so uh should i should i give an overview first uh yeah yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is a uh it looks like a mixture of expert a transformer uh on the base model and then uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what they have done differently is like uh they want to make sure like this model has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">arc capabilities agentic coding and reasoning abilities so what they have done they uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">post training they they they've used like two different ways to train this model like they stage one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they uh they train an expert model uh for each specific task like agent degree reasoning and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">coding and then once they have like a a sub expert expert model they distill these capabilities into one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">uh unique one model so the uh that's why uh this model seems to have like all three capabilities uh and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this model can is able to like uh uh have like a switch between modes like thinking long thinking modes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and then uh quick response modes uh i haven't actually uh used the model much but i asked claude to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">generate some uh some task and prompt to verify these capabilities so maybe post this talk we can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if we can go through uh if this model is actually looking good um with those tasks but basically this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">mixture of experts um and yeah um and these are like some metrics they provided uh with arc capabilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">i'll move to the second yeah i feel like arc is a little bit um co-opted by arcgi but arc has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">definite definition which i think you're showing on screen right now right uh oh yeah the arc challenge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">true so they these people like they say arc uh to define like uh if the model has agentic or reasoning or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">coding capabilities all together in one uh one model instead of using multiple models to achieve uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">different performances uh so they clearly define the ambition here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so how often um like yeah this seems like the main uh drive behind the this model training uh to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all these capabilities in a single model and then uh the paper mostly quickly goes through uh like uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what they have done uh and then also the rl training pipeline and how they approach like a data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">synthesis for training etc but this uh these are like a bunch of metrics they've mentioned here and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they have now a smaller model as well but they haven't mentioned much about the smaller model apart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from i'm assuming it's a distillation yeah these are like a bunch of metrics how we uh how we performed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on a various metrics uh i i try to see if they have like uh the training loop made available i don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they've made the training loop available for open source i think the only weights are available in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">git repo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">uh so yeah architecture the fundamental architecture is like a mixture of experts i feel like the only thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they changed is uh uh they used a muon optimizer instead of adam i'm not really sure if adam is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">standard but they're using beyond uh they mentioned this down somewhere here yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so they used one optimizer uh and then what else they've changed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah so for for context basically for the past few years the adam and adam w optimizers they've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">very much the standard defaults there hasn't been much progress like adam came then adam w</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">uh the recent kimmy k2 paper it's like the big the big model that came out after um after deep seek</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they switched to a muon flip optimizer it's like better training stability they have a very pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">loss curve so that's kind of the background optimizer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">um and one thing they have done uh they have this is like the general pattern they used like uh they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">started with 4k context window and then they increased the context window to 32 and uh and afterwards like 1.28</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and uh and they mentioned like how they collected their data uh so basically uh yeah they used like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">web crawling uh to have like english and chinese web pages and then uh they used like a quality metric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so here they mentioned like uh they divide the crawl web pages into buckets with different quality scores</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they're up sampling the documents uh so that like they uh the initial like the base data is much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">much higher quality um and then they they were using like uh this uh semdudu uh to basically uh deduplicate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like uh data i mean the duplicate data uh this basically mentions like what they have done with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-training data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and one thing they uh they said like uh they used like group query attention with partial rope in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">attention block and then also they mentioned like uh attention heads or more so uh one of the claim was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like having more attentions and wider instead of like uh sorry instead of uh having deeper uh deeper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">over the white like it increases the reasoning capabilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and</span></div><div

that i mean with high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">quality data and

target="_blank">00:11:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's basically they increased the context and they added like a more data like a long context and</span></div><div class="c"><span

they mentioned like uh they boosted like context length from 32k to 180 180k</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=757"

mid training because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the type of data and then um that's like the first question on the other one about um best fit packing so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one thing you can do if you have like long context let's say you're training on like 32k context right</span></div><div class="c"><span

sequence land uh what you do in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of packing is you can concatenate multiple samples into one one sample right so like if i have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1179"

could not do that and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">could just

target="_blank">00:21:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they're doing any of this so the real point of packing is just you keep sequence similar and it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span

like some paper that talks about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">why they have done on the pre-training stage most of their focus on like uh making

target="_blank">00:25:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">uh they created expert models for each uh specific task and then stage two they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">use distillation techniques to integrate these multiple experts</span></div><div

they do this safety for both stage one and stage two and in expert training like uh this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">basically like making sure that the model has basic capabilities uh to either to generate or to respond</span></div><div class="c"><span

perform these tasks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">uh one thing they

target="_blank">00:29:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so i think here they also mentioned like uh by distilling from output of distinct experts the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">uh learns uh learns quickly applying long context of like cot reasoning for each task and then it can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">switch from uh thinking long or also thinking short without any explicit uh without any explicit suggestion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and third one uh the rejection sampling i feel like uh so while sampling uh they want to make sure that like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">uh they sample high quality data uh this rejection sampling they basically mentioned how they have done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that uh they want to make sure that it's in the valid format and then um verification with the objective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like i think the math or science uh you can have linear objective answers even the code uh so they did that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">uh that part as well and then uh and then uh they have like uh reward models for subjective questions uh it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can be either uh rl hf or or early ai uh uh and then uh they use this metric to distill the um sampler i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">mean um reject the sample and then i feel like the tool calling scenario is very interesting um they go deeper in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">later stages as well how they orchestrated like the tool coring or uh yeah i'm gonna talk about that later</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">section and then also uh seems like they uh they selected few prompts to improve the uh uh or like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they deleted like some of the prompts which are not conducive to better results um they mentioned that here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and they state that like it improved uh improved the reasoning capabilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">so here they mentioned like how they uh constructed the agentic sft data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so uh i feel like they they used like existing frameworks like mcp servers uh to uh get like a basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">features and then they created uh they did task synthesis it seems like uh they used like whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the documentation they have for mcp servers to create tasks uh that seems like a very uh yeah it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so they used llms to comprehend functionalities and then generate relevant queries and tasks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and for uh fragmented like uh they they did follow similar approach but they uh like uh first they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">select like a

target="_blank">00:32:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">um yeah single step and multi-step tool calling i i believe uh uh this basically says that like uh in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the reasoning process you may have to use like a uh like one color

then uh uh hybrid hey vanky sorry just a quick kind of maybe might be a stupid question but i just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2002" target="_blank">00:33:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to confirm is it the actual like them training specialized experts is this different to the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">models do you

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or other papers does it i don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span

the way yes yeah i had my head</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">set microphone on sorry about that uh i was also curious about what what was the motivation for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">using distinct experts versus just using good rollouts and i i kind of the conclusion i came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to for myself was that they have this like multi-stage uh curriculum where they're they keep they mention a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">couple places where they keep uh you know sort of doing like rollouts of their own data and so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe in the early phases it's easier to generate uh distinct experts than it is to generate one model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's good at all three and then and that's why so they like in the process of generating a a generic model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's easier to to do like specific like fine basically fine-tuned models that are good at one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">thing and then distill them all into the same model that's that was my take i'm not sure i've ever seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this my before myself i agree in in the oral setup like they mentioned this uh they needed like different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture for different types of uh reasoning tasks or reinforcement learning tasks so maybe that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">why they so they actually change the architecture for each expert uh i think so um interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah they have a slim rl and then uh they mentioned sometimes like uh for software engineering task like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they had to have like docker containers and uh other stuff like uh so they mentioned data like a bit later</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the page but i'm not sure like this is like the training architecture not the model architecture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right oh i see okay yeah no but that makes sense why you would also want to split that okay that's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really interesting um right so here uh they use like llms uh they used existing frameworks and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they did task synthesis based on uh based on these frameworks and then uh so i feel like a lot of times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">they uh they uh they do this synthesis to get the uh data uh required for training and then also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they use like quality filtering uh to make sure that they have like a high quality data goes into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">training yeah and then they use llms to generate this uh multi-step tool called uh into trajectories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">uh yeah we'll move on to reasoning rl now one thing they uh i think uh they use like a grpo i feel like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this is like a common framework even deep seek uses this i'm not sure uh i'm not exactly sure what is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2228" target="_blank">00:37:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this uh this loss term um yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so one thing i understand based on this like uh so yeah uh if i understand like aurel correctly like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for each task like you you get a reward and based on the reward you change the policy uh you take an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">option based on the existing policy you get a reward and then change it so here they uh they want to have like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">uh if if the task is like too complicated like the reward would be always zero so we don't have any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">gradient to train the model better way so they want to make sure that like uh at particular stage we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like appropriate reward or like we get a reward so that like we can train more or train better so uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">so in stage one they use like moderate examples moderate difficult data uh and then after like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2284" target="_blank">00:38:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">certain point like after certain training steps they use like extremely difficult data so that like they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have a better gradient or the model is well trained enough to produce a gradient or produce a reward um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">i think that's what i understand of from this uh curriculum based learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2304" target="_blank">00:38:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah uh and they tried to use like a different context uh like uh like 16k 32k 48 and 64.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">i i believe at the end they decided like it's better to use like a 64k context window uh there is no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">additional advantage with the uh starting with the small context window and then increasing the uh</span></div><div class="c"><span

like uh this two stage approach uh increasing the difficulty produces uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">some better performances better performance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah also they mentioned like a single stage rl at 64 output length uh this is a for that uh in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">second paragraph like this

they used a different uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">loss function

like uh using different uh loss function uh for like a coding tasks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">uh i think uh that comes in this paragraph but we can talk about this first and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">so uh temperature i believe it's like a common uh temperature we see in llms like if the temperature is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a high uh it

dynamic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">temperature um and then they have like a certain validation to make sure that like the temperature they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have chosen uh is working fine uh is working fine uh yeah so here they mentioned how they uh how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they have chosen temperature based on the validation uh validation

actually there's two charts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they have these two charts that kind of break down multi-stage versus single stage training and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">breaking off of um

with the distillation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">uh so like the high level process is like first you train the three experts right reasoner agent and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">general chat then you know you change them what you train them with a cold start of sft traces then you do rl</span></div><div class="c"><span

on their rollouts like flat out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right they do a lot of filtration so like for the distillation from three experts they they do rejection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=3366" target="_blank">00:56:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right it's not like they just do three models and then they merge them into one like some weird model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRm-MBsvdE&t=3371" target="_blank">00:56:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">merge
