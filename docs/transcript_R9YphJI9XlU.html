Not to us, O Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory, because of your lovingkindness, because of your truth. Why should the nations say, "Where now is their God?" But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever He pleases.</p><p>Their idols are silver and gold, the work of man's hands. They have mouths, but they do not speak. They have eyes, but they do not see. They have ears, but they do not hear. They have noses, but they do not smell. As for their hands, they do not feel.</p><p>As for their feet, they do not walk. They do not make a sound with their throat. Those who make them will become like them. Everyone who trusts in them. O Israel, trust in Yahweh. He is their help and their shield. O house of Aaron, trust in Yahweh. He is their help and their shield.</p><p>You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh. He is their help and their shield. Yahweh remembered us. He will bless. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron. He will bless those who fear Yahweh, the small together with the great. May Yahweh give you increase, you and your children.</p><p>May you be blessed of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth. The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh, but the earth he has given to the sons of man. It is not the dead that praise Yah, and it is none of those who go down to silence. But as for us, we will bless Yah from now until forever.</p><p>Praise Yah. Praise Yah. Praise Yah. Praise Yah. Praise Yah. Praise Yah.</p></div></div></body></html>
