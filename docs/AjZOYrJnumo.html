It was obvious that Taylor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was the leader.

And then Taylor got in touch with me and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Mel, maybe we ought to work together." And that's when we wrote your first post,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">3321, on the Morningstar Vanguard Diehards Forum. That was a post that anybody could refer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">new people to, which told them what to expect, how to format their questions, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess it was in 1999 when I made a post on Vanguard Diehards about Happy Thanksgiving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and we were like a small family.

And that's when we got a handwritten note</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from Jack asking if there was any interest in getting together with him at a non-resort. Jack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically said at a non-resort place. So Taylor and I started working on figuring out how we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">make this happen because for us that was like getting an audience with the Pope or an invitation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to the White House. So in 2000, Taylor got in touch with me. I was a snowbird at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Taylor got in touch with me knowing I was going to be in Florida, and Jack was the keynote speaker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">at the Miami Herald Making Money Seminar. So we decided that this would be a good time to try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">get together with Jack. So I called the Miami Herald people and asked if they could give us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a place for maybe an hour to have lunch with Jack or something. And they kind of shooed us away like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we just didn't belong and didn't fit in. So I got in touch with Jack and told him that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">my Miami Herald people said they couldn't work it out. He said, "Well, I'll go wherever you want me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to go." So that's when Taylor and I decided to invite the forum members to join us in Miami</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">with Jack for an evening. And we said, "Well, what if we get 100 or 200 people? What are we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do?" So we decided we would have a small gathering with Jack and we hired a maid and a chef</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and had an evening with Jack at Taylor's Condo. And that was the start of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">annual Bogleheads Conferences. We thought it was a one-time-off. What a beautiful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">evening we had with Jack. And just as an aside, the Miami Herald people came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hand-in-hand and asked if they could send a photographer and a reporter instead of being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">jerks like they were to us. We let them come and we ended up with a nice front page story on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Miami Herald business section and carried over to the inside. But Jack went online at the end of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">evening on Taylor's computer. And that was very confusing because people couldn't understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that they thought Taylor was impersonating Jack. And Jack was talking about the wonderful evening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">he had with Taylor, the king of the Bogleheads, and Mel, the prince. And that's where I became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the prince of the Bogleheads, officially anointed by Jack, which was a total surprise to me. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what a pleasure. And after that meeting, people started saying, "When's the next one?" And when's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the next one? We thought this was it. So that was the start of the Bogleheads Conferences and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">our relationship with Jack. And Jack would go wherever we wanted him. We tried for a number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of years to go where he was appearing. Morningstar Conference hosted us for the third one at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Morningstar Conference because Jack was a keynote speaker. And then the CFA Conference in Denver was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">our fourth one. But then after that, in 2005, Taylor and I were busy writing the first book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jack got in touch and said, "Mel, when's the next conference?" And I said, "Jack, we couldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">find any place that you were appearing at." He said, "I'll go wherever you want me to go." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that was the start of our own independent conferences. And we started moving around the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">country, using the local chapter people to help us out with various meetings, taking care of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hotels and things like that. So it's been quite a ride, and it's hard to believe, Taylor. I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">figured out that was a quarter of your life that we've spent doing this. We're going on 26 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">now. And time really flies when you're having fun, and it's been a great ride. It's hard to believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that with all the people that tried to publish books that can't get them published, we got a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">publisher calling us up and asking us to write a book.

But it turned out to be a real joy. And, in fact, Taylor and I now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the publisher has asked us to update the first book in the book, which we've written.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We are having a difficult time hearing you, Mel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZOYrJnumo&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got a deadline on that now, June the 30th, Taylor, or June the 1st.
