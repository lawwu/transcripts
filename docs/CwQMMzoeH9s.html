when we broke up Ma Bell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=315">00:05:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">well, what that circle would

prove that that monopoly then led to pricing power in ads,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=391">00:06:31.680</a></span> | <span

fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=399">00:06:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The Texas version of this exact lawsuit already

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=493">00:08:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this and I was pretty close to double-click and the acquisition.</span></div><div class="c"><span

of ad inventory have the option to sell their inventory on an ad network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=522">00:08:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the money that they're making on those ad slots that they have, whether it's a slot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=526">00:08:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on the side of a page or the top of a page or an interstitial video ad, whatever it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=529">00:08:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to keep selling their inventory through that network if they're getting paid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=535">00:08:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the most.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=535">00:08:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the real reason Google has won is two-part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=538">00:08:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">One is because they ran their ad network as an auction, meaning advertisers were competing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=544">00:09:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with each other to pay the most for an ad spot that was the highest quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=548">00:09:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also an ad quality index calculation, a click-through index, a bounce-back index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=553">00:09:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's all this data that feeds into Google's ad network auction so that the ad that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=559">00:09:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">shown on the publisher's site is not just the best ad for the publisher, but the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=563">00:09:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ad for the consumer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=564">00:09:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when the consumer clicks on the ad, the publisher gets paid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=567">00:09:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the second thing that Google did, and so the auction dynamic is a really powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=571">00:09:31.440</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=577">00:09:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">ad for the user, which translates typically into higher click-throughs and better revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=582">00:09:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What they also did that was really powerful is they did the highest revenue share in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=588">00:09:48.080</a></span> | <span

like, I think, initially like a 60/40 red share where they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=593">00:09:53.440</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">Then the network started to move to a 55/45 model, then a 50/50 model, then a 45/55 model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=602">00:10:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe on average, Google currently is paying somewhere between 70 and 80% to their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=608">00:10:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">publishers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=608">00:10:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I got to check my math on that or whatever the latest report is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=612">00:10:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I heard high 60s, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=613">00:10:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but call it 70.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=615">00:10:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it is a very competitive share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=618">00:10:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the point being, because it's an auction system and because it's opt-in by the publisher,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=623">00:10:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">if they're not paying the highest price, the publisher can go and get ads from somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=627">00:10:27.280</a></span> | <span

their own sales force to sell ads and to source advertisers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=632">00:10:32.880</a></span> | <span

class="t">And it turns out it was a lot more effective to use an ad network to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=639">00:10:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The other ad networks simply haven't been as good at building an auction model and building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=643">00:10:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">competitiveness.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2738">00:45:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Mass General team identified 16 people that had myocarditis that were

have historically been three kind of theories about why there is incidents of myocarditis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2754">00:45:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in certain populations that get the COVID vaccine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2758">00:45:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, the incidence rate is still typically less than two out of every 100,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2763">00:46:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people that get the vaccine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2765">00:46:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you saw in the paper you just shared, and others have validated it, it can be as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2768">00:46:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">high as 30 times more likely to happen in young people that take the the Moderna vaccine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2774">00:46:14.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2778">00:46:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2779">00:46:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the three kind of reasons are the three ideas 30 times higher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2782">00:46:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That sounds like a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2783">00:46:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so the reason and also small base, but yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2786">00:46:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the three ideas are the three theories around why this is happening.</span></div><div

protein on their,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2795">00:46:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">their heart tissue, for example, or certain proteins found in the cells in their heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2799">00:46:39.440</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2805">00:46:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, when you make antibodies to bind to and clear your body of spike protein, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2810">00:46:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">also binding to your own cells and causing an

they act and behave differently, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5004">01:23:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they have different gene expression, meaning different genes in that cell are turned on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5010">01:23:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And when a gene is turned on, the protein that that gene codes for is expressed and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5015">01:23:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">made in the cell, and the genes that are off those proteins are not made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5018">01:23:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, proteins are the biochemical machines in biology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5022">01:23:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So when certain proteins are produced, they do stuff and other proteins don't do stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5026">01:23:46.560</a></span> | <span

class="t">So some cells when you turn genes on and off, you get a neuron, some cells, you turn them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5032">01:23:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">on and off, you get a muscle cell in your bicep, some of them, you get a heart

the genes that are expressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5042">01:24:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The general term for the expression of genes is the epigenome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5046">01:24:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And an epigenome basically refers to these systems whereby certain parts of the DNA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5054">01:24:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">certain segments of genes are uncoiled a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5058">01:24:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you zoom in on DNA, you know, there's 23 chromosomes, they're tightly wrapped in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5063">01:24:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">these coils.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5064">01:24:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you go even closer, you see that there's these segments called nucleosomes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5068">01:24:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And a nucleosome means it's like a bead, and a bunch of DNA is wrapped around the bead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5072">01:24:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And how closely those beads are together, how much the DNA is wrapped, allows a segment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5077">01:24:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of the DNA to be opened up, and then expressed, meaning copies of the DNA are turned into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5083">01:24:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">RNA, which floats into this thing called the

the more these little segments of genome are exposed, the more they're expressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5092">01:24:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are certain chemicals, these methyls and acetyls that kind of attach to the genome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5097">01:24:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and certain elements that allow parts of the chromosome to wrap up and get really tightly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5101">01:25:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">bound or to unwrap and to express the gene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5105">01:25:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the epigenome is almost you can think about it like the software, and the genome or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5110">01:25:10.880</a></span> |

hardware basically defines what you can make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5115">01:25:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The

aging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5124">01:25:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">meant that over time, the DNA in our cells was mutating, and errors were accumulating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5129">01:25:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in the

to dysfunction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5133">01:25:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And what these guys really did a good

changing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5289">01:28:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So then here's what they
