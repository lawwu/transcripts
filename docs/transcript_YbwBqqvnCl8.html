He's now in his 80s, he is clearly on the decline, he's not incompetent. All I'm doing you guys is saying the quiet part out loud. I think they're disappointed because this is not what you do when you're a member of a party, you fall in line, you shush up, you sit down, you get in line, and you do nothing to upset the apple cart of others who've been waiting in line perhaps a little longer than you.</p><p>Most members of Congress thought he was going to stand down. I called Gretchen Whitmer, I called J.B. Pritzker to jump in. The water's warm, you guys, it's a Democratic primary, that's what we do. Not only did those two not take my calls, which they would have any other day, they had their political operatives take those calls and they told me, "Please don't use their names." That's the culture, you guys, that we're dealing with.</p><p>You will be blackballed, you will be disenfranchised, you will be let out the door if you so much as even issue a word that you might challenge a sitting president of the United States.</p></div></div></body></html>
