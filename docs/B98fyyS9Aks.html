They're taking the standard deduction instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I would point them to a couple of things to think about with respect to charitable giving and making sure that they get a tax credit for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">One would be, if you're over 70 and a half, taking a look at what's called the Qualified Charitable Distribution, which is a contribution that you can make directly from your IRA account where you're steering an amount in 2022,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">an amount up to $100,000 to the charity or charities of your choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the nice thing about the QCD is it reduces your IRA account, and in turn, when required minimum distributions start applying to you, it can reduce the amount of your IRA balance that's subject to RMDs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So people should check out that if they are over age 70 and a half.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">If people aren't yet at that age, another strategy to consider that tax advisors get very excited about is the idea of trying to bunch your deductions together into a single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So specifically, earmarking charitable contributions for a given year where, taken all together, those contributions will get you over the standard deduction amount in a given year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And a donor-advised fund can come in handy here. I know a lot of Bogleheads are very enthusiastic about their donor-advised funds, and Vanguard has a good one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can contribute to the donor-advised fund, use maybe appreciated shares in some cases, so remove the tax obligation associated with that security by contributing the shares directly to the donor-advised fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But the basic idea is you pick your spots and you decide that in a given year you'll be a big charitable giver and get yourself over that standard deduction amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So an example, somebody who's giving $5,000 a year to charity might lump five years together and make it $25,000 and put it into a donor-advised fund and use maybe appreciated security so they don't have to pay the capital gain when they do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the $25,000 goes into the donor-advised fund with the state and local taxes and maybe some other deductions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It gets them over the standard deductions. They're able to at least deduct some of that contribution to the donor-advised fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But then once it's in the donor-advised fund, then they can send it out to charity, $5,000 a year over a five-year period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the charity doesn't see any difference. It's just taking it as a tax deduction all up front.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. And that's why this is such a beautiful strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be especially attractive for people who have a large share of their portfolio in employer stock, where that stock is detracting from the portfolio's diversification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Oftentimes that stock has a big tax bill attached to it. Those are ideal securities to send to the donor-advised fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can sometimes contribute illiquid types of securities to the donor-advised fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There may be a surcharge, and I think it depends on the provider, to deal with the less liquid securities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's a terrific option, where maybe you're just a bogelhead. You want to have a bogelhead portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But you have, for whatever reason, large stock positions in your portfolio. It's a great way to deal with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's move on to this year, as we move into the tax year 2023, and we have something new out there called the SECURE Act, SECURE 2.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of the SECURE Act had to do with corporations and employers and bringing more people into the 401(k) umbrella.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was also some things in there that other people can use. Talk about some of those in more general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure. It is a grab bag of different provisions related to retirement planning, but a couple jump out at me, Rick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">One is a change in the required minimum distribution age. So it had been 72. Starting in 2023, it's moving out to 73.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That is an important change to note for older adults who are getting close to decumulating from their retirement portfolios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's moving to 73 starting this year and then moving all the way out to 75 starting in 2033.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So to me, this presents a really interesting opportunity for people who are on the brink of retirement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">who aren't yet subject to required minimum distributions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of interesting tax planning that can happen in those early retirement years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really credit Maria Bruno at Vanguard for evangelizing about what she calls kind of the retirement planning sweet spot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is the post-retirement, pre-RMD period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason it's so valuable from a tax planning standpoint is that these are often the lowest tax years in someone's life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">because they no longer have income from their jobs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a great time to consider strategies like converting traditional IRA balances to Roth in these post-retirement, pre-RMD years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The advantages is that you might be able to take advantage of a fairly low tax rate in those years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You might also consider even preemptively taking IRA distributions with an eye toward reducing your RMD subject balances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there are other non-IRA strategies to consider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, the 0% capital gains bracket applies to people with incomes below a certain threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might be able to consider strategies like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">One sort of real world countervailing force in my mind, though, Rick, is that in my experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">these are often the high spending years in people's retirement where they're feeling good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They have busy travel plans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They're healthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They're healthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And they should take advantage of those years to fulfill whatever dreams they had for their retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So that may put a lid on how much they can keep their taxable income down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But another side note I would make on this point is that to take advantage of these years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you really do need to think about stashing money in taxable non-retirement accounts early on in your career, ideally.</span></div><div

diversification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have those taxable assets that you can pull from to provide your living expenses in those early retirement years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I would make one comment on this, and that is that if you happen to retire before you go on Medicare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and you don't have health insurance, that you may be going to the health care exchange and using the Affordable Care Act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And if that's what you're doing and you're qualifying for Affordable Care Act tax credits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">then you would not want to take distributions from your IRA or do Roth conversions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.500</a></span>

target="_blank">00:19:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's such a great point for pre-Medicare retirees, certainly an important consideration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I do want to make one more note, and that has to do with Medicare.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:28:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the basic idea is, just as you said, Rick, that if people have residual balances in 529s where they've effectively overfunded the 529, those funds can be transferred to a Roth IRA for that same beneficiary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1735"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lifetime transfer limit of $35,000.</span></div><div

years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have young ones in your life, children, grandkids, I think that really argues for thinking about getting these accounts set up early, getting the 529 set up early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think it just adds a nice level of optionality to 529 planning, where in the past you did have quite a bit of flexibility to transfer residual balances to different beneficiaries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But most people, I think, would like the flexibility to maintain the assets for the same beneficiary, the same child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also important to note that only the contributions and earnings attributable to contributions made more than five years ago are eligible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not like you could superfund the 529 in the waning days of your child's high school career or something and necessarily be able to get the funds over to a Roth IRA later on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to be careful about the date limits that apply to these potential transfers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

is that you are, in many cases, earning a state tax credit or deduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1836"

that you've been working on at Morningstar with your colleague Jeff Pratek and John Reckenthaler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So first of all, tell us about the project and then get into some of the changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the key things to think about with respect to retirement planning is how much you can safely take out of your portfolio over your lifetime without running out of funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's one of the most

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't know how the markets will perform over our time horizon.</span></div><div

that go into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.500</a></span> | <span

has been around for a long time is what's called the 4% guideline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It was originally developed by William Bengin, a financial planner, but the idea that he had was what is the most that a retiree could have taken out in year one of retirement and then inflation adjusts that dollar amount thereafter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if he or she hit Armageddon in terms of market performance, what was the most starting withdrawal percentage that he or she could have taken out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just want to clarify what you said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We're looking at just year one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div

dollars, $40,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So starting with year one, $40,000 if it's 4%, and then that number adjusted for inflation going forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The number never changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's always $40,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I reading that correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So if inflation is 3% the following year, you're taking $41,000 and change in that next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not 4% in perpetuity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of confusion about this that people think, "Oh, you're saying I can safely take 4% year in and year out of whatever my balance is."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason that Bengin didn't arrive at that strategy is that that leads to a lot of variability in people's cash flows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people, especially more affluent people, might say, "I'm fine with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just take that fixed percentage."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But many people on smaller budgets would just be buffeted around too much if they were taking a fixed percentage of whatever their balance happened to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the formula.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2096" target="_blank">00:34:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That was the framework that Bengin arrived at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">He used historical market returns to determine that 4% was more or less safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me interrupt for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">What does the word "safe" mean when you're saying 4% was safe?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">What exactly does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's a really good point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are different interpretations of what's safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">What we used in our research was a 90% likelihood of not running out of funds over a 30-year time horizon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can alter that as you see fit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can assume a lower probability of success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can take that down to 85%, for example, or take it all the way up to 100%, which I would not recommend, but you could do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I believe in Bengin's original research, he was using like a 90% probability of not running out of funds over a 30-year time horizon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can tinker with that based on the probability that you're comfortable with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have our starting number, some percentage, and we can adjust that for inflation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">At least in the studies that you're doing, there's a 90% probability that if you just do that, you're not going to run out of money during a 30-year period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And this could be either a single person or joint with spouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't really change, correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.500</a></span> | <span

distinction with our research and the reason why we have been updating this research every year is that our thought is, yes, historical returns and how the market has behaved historically is super important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But also, what do we know about how starting yields and equity valuations might affect returns in the future?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what we attempt to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We attempt to take a forward-looking view of how the stock and bond markets might perform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So William Bengen looked back over market history to come up with the 4% guideline, which he has since made some revisions to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Our idea is that, yes, historical market returns are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They should influence how people consider, how people think about what's safe in terms of their withdrawal rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But we think it makes sense to incorporate starting yields, equity valuations to create a kind of a forward-looking view of how the market might perform over the next 30 years and use that to inform what's a safe withdrawal rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So we turn to our colleagues in Morningstar Investment

target="_blank">00:37:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They do them over a variety of time periods, but we take their 30-year forecast and plug them into our models and then use Monte Carlo simulations to help look at what would have been a safe withdrawal rate for investors with different time horizons and with different asset allocations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

equity, foreign stocks, fixed income, cash and inflation in this report?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let me say, compare and contrast what you were using in 2021 with 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's a lot better in 2022 versus what we were assuming in 2021.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So most of the equity market assumptions, and it varies a little bit by sub-asset class, they run the gamut from 9% all the way up to 12%, so 9% for U.S. large value, 12% for U.S. small value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">In contrast, while the non-U.S. component, the non-U.S. assumptions were higher in 2021 or were as high in 2021 as they were in 2022, the U.S. equity forecast was substantially lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the return assumption, this is a 30-year return assumption for most of the sub-asset classes in U.S. equities, ranged between 6% and 8%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So big bump up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">One caveat I would make, though, Rick, is that 9/30/2022 is the return assumption that we use, so that it was dated as of September 30th, 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The market was kind of, I don't know if it was bottoming, but the market performance had been terrible through that period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's picked up a little bit since.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We've seen somewhat better returns from the stock market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It passes that the team has probably curtailed their return assumptions a little bit since they produced those September 30th, 2022 numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in terms of inflation, we used a 2.8% annualized inflation assumption for that 30-year horizon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">>> So higher than what the Federal Reserve target is of 2%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, interesting, I went into other data, Morningstar data, and looked at 10-year returns for U.S. equities, developed markets, emerging markets, bonds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2428" target="_blank">00:40:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And over the next 10 years, even Morningstar was forecasting a little lower returns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You were forecasting, on average, in general, about 6% for U.S. equity and developed markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You were forecasting roughly 8% emerging markets, a little higher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So these 30-year forecasts are considerably higher than even your 10-year forecasts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I would note that it's a separate team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't work in Morningstar Investment Management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think what they're looking at in terms of the curtailed 10-year equity return assumption is just that U.S. equities, even though they have had a tough year in 2022, still are not inexpensive by historic norms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're giving historical returns a little bit of a haircut to account for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They're potentially factoring in some lower earnings growth in the U.S. over the next decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The foreign stock assumptions are much better, and I would say that when we look across different firms, there's some uniformity in that view, where non-U.S., because of lower starting valuations, the non-U.S. equity markets are likely to have better returns over the next decade than the U.S. market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">>> And these are just general numbers, but I took your 10-year forecasts, and I said, okay, let's come up with one general global equity expectation of return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's say U.S. is 6% over the next 10 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are annualized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not arithmetic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2545" target="_blank">00:42:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Which is different than annualized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Arithmetic is just taking the average and dividing it by, say, 10, every year and dividing it by 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Compounding lowers the return due to volatility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So my first thought when I looked at your 2022 numbers for the 30-year forecast, because they were quite high in my view, was that you were just using an arithmetic return, but in fact it actually was annualized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2570" target="_blank">00:42:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyway, I don't want to get into the math behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But just getting one generic global equity expectation using all the data that you showed for 10 years, with the U.S. being 6% and international, which would include both developed markets and emerging markets combined, 75% developed, 25% emerging, comes out to roughly 8.5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you were to have a portfolio that was roughly two-thirds in the U.S. market and one-third in the international market, you'd be around 7%, 7% equity expected return at least over the next 10 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I came up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Try to make it simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the bond side, 4%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's very, very close to what I use with my own clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Think of 7% equity and 4% in fixed income and then some element for cash, maybe 3%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what I've been using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I found it interesting that that's what the 10-year numbers are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I looked at the data that you used for the 30-year numbers, it was a lot higher than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, just throw that out there as a caveat, meaning if you want to be super safe with the numbers that we're about to talk about, which is the withdrawal rate, that there is some discussion out there about the 30-year numbers that you used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So your withdrawal rate, safe withdrawal rate for the 90th percentile in 2020 was 3.2%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">However, because the assumption for 30-year returns on stocks, bonds, and cash are higher now that the markets have come back down, what is it now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I should note that finding was that if someone had a 60% equity, 40% bond portfolio, that 3.8% starting withdrawal would be safe for someone with that type of asset allocation mix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We did find that maybe somewhat surprisingly to your listeners that really dialing up equity exposure didn't help that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's in part because of the volatility and the variability of equity returns, that it's just too risky for someone to have a mostly equity portfolio in retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other factor in the mix is just that bond yields have gotten so much better that retirees would be foolish to not take advantage of that very safe return potential that's currently available, was not previously available, but is currently available from fixed income.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So we look at all different time periods. This is the 30-year time period. What you can see is that if you have a shorter time horizon, so say a 15-year time horizon, maybe you're a retiree who's been retired for 15 years or so, and that you think your life expectancy is roughly 15 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see that with a 60/40 portfolio, you could take closer to 7%. So it's a good check, I think, on whatever withdrawal you're taking currently. It's a way to check on whether that is a reasonable withdrawal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The equity side of your number had large-cap growth and large-cap value, basically 30% large-cap growth, 30% large-cap value, 20% in foreign stocks, 10% in small-cap growth, and 10% in small-cap value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So my question is, in the creation of this equity side, 20% seems a little bit light in foreign securities in most asset allocation models. I mean, globally, right now, if you're a U.S. investor, market capitalization would be 60% U.S., 40% international, but you used only 20% international. So I'm curious why that was used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I can answer it generally, which is that when you do look at most professionally managed asset allocations, I think they're more in the neighborhood of 25%, 30%. But one thing I think about with respect to non-U.S. allocations and retiree portfolios is that there is a wild card of foreign currency fluctuations that comes along with non-U.S. stock exposure, non-U.S. bond exposure, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the fact is, as someone gets closer to spending from the portfolio and begins to actively draw upon the portfolio, that does at least theoretically argue for perhaps reducing the non-U.S. exposure a little bit because the idea is that the spending will be done in U.S. dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2865" target="_blank">00:47:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know that in the past, when I've looked at my colleagues in Morningstar Investment Management's allocations, I've noted that they have, in fact, stepped off the gas a little bit in terms of foreign stock exposure for older adults with that very thought in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same goes for other factor tilts that they might employ. So, for example, I believe they have a little heavier weighting in small value, U.S. small value for younger investors. They pull back from that a little bit and go more sort of U.S. market style neutral as someone approaches retirement, in part because at that life stage, you just have less time to potentially benefit from factor tilts like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in summary on these numbers, these 30-year numbers, at least some would argue they are a little bit high. At least they feel they're a little bit high. But they're also over-weighting U.S. to international versus what a global allocation would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And international would be expected to do better than U.S. So, if you went more to a more market neutral allocation between international and U.S., the number would go up even though maybe the overall expected returns of these asset classes would go down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, my point is that in the end, this is just an estimate, obviously. We're dealing with all kinds of assumptions here. And what you came up with in the model, the 90th percentile, was 3.8%, which means if you add a million dollars, your starting number would be $38,000. Do I have that correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. And so, a real world point that should be made in this context is just that we're talking about end of 2022 balances. Most investors had a decline in their portfolios in 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, 3.8% of a smaller portfolio balance may, in fact, translate into a smaller take-home withdrawal, starting withdrawal for someone who retired at the end of 2022 versus what would have been the case with that lower percentage on a larger balance at the end of 2021.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I often think that as much as we like to think and talk about withdrawal rates, what really matters to people is their withdrawal amount. And then that effect of declining markets last year is that even though a higher percentage would be supported, it may translate into a lower take-home paycheck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's talk about some other things, too, which you've talked about in various discussions. And it has to do with how people actually spend money, where there's this spending smile, they call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Where, like you said earlier, you know, when you're in your 60s and you're healthy, you're going to go out travel and spend a little bit more money. But certainly, once you get into your 80s, you're not traveling as much, your spending is going down. So, how does all that factor into these numbers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's such an important dimension, Rick. In fact, I sometimes think like this baseline withdrawal rate discussion is, if I'm being candid, a little bit of a straw man in that when we look at the data on how people actually spend, they don't spend in a flat line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't spend this fixed real withdrawal amount year in and year out. And so, I often reference some research that was done by my former colleague, David Blanchett, where he looked at how retiree households actually spend their money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And he identified exactly the pattern that you just referenced, where it's kind of a smile-shaped spending pattern, where the spending is high early on, it trails off in the middle to later years of retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3107" target="_blank">00:51:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think about older adults who you may have known in your life, this probably syncs up with your own experience with them. They spend less in the middle to later years of retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They're maybe not traveling as much. Maybe they had two homes and they moved down to the single one in the warm climate. And then spending sometimes trails up later in life, and that's often to cover uninsured healthcare outlays, especially long-term care outlays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3137" target="_blank">00:52:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in consultation with David, in this year's run of the data, we decided to try to incorporate that spending smile idea. And David identified that retirees, on average, spend about a percentage point less than the actual inflation rate over their total time horizons, because spending declines in the middle to later years of retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3164" target="_blank">00:52:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for the purposes of this study, we haircut our baseline inflation assumption of 2.8% to 1.8% to reflect that finding that David identified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you might imagine, that delivers a lift to spending early on in retirement. So, for people who want to be able to spend a little bit more early on in retirement, it gives them a lift in their initial withdrawal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But in exchange, that means that they have to take less than the inflation rate on an ongoing basis. So, it's a bargain that might be attractive to some retirees. It was something that we wanted to explore in the research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found that with that assumption, assuming a lower inflation adjustment on an ongoing basis, that retirees could take comfortably over 4%, assuming those same baseline assumptions of a 60/40 portfolio, a 30-year time horizon, and a 90% probability of success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to say that the data and the analysis on retirement spending is just getting better and better and better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, reports like yours, it's information. It's a data point. I mean, it's not the end all. It's just useful information that you can incorporate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There are also now some great software out there, some of it free, some of it you could buy, like NewRetirement.com, where you could model this out in a similar fashion and it incorporates taxes and Roth conversions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, fortunately, it's just getting better and better and better for everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, with this particular study, where do you see it going and what's the next thing? You incorporated spending patterns as people age. I mean, what's the next iteration of this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I continue to be really intrigued by the variable strategies. And you mentioned, Rick, that software is available to help people navigate this. But it seems like if you try to reflect on what are the commonalities of what leads to success or failure in retirement, being flexible with your withdrawals is super important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3301" target="_blank">00:55:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you can pay attention to what's going on in your portfolio balance, indirectly pay attention to what's going on in the market, that can help improve your withdrawal success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one set of research within this research paper looks at these various what are called dynamic strategies. One I particularly like is called the guardrail strategy that was developed by financial planner, Jonathan Guyton, in conjunction with William Klinger, who's a computer scientist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And guardrails looks really good from the standpoint of our research in that it gives someone a higher starting withdrawal, and it also gives them a higher lifetime withdrawal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think guardrails is especially important for retirees who are a little less concerned with having funds left over at the end of their lives, and most concerned with enjoying the fruits of their labors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, making sure that they spend in line with their goals that guardrail strategy allows them to spend a little bit more. So, for people who want to take a look at our paper, we do dive into several of the dynamic strategies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what's surprising is that even fairly modest tweaks to a fixed with real withdrawal system can give a lift to starting withdrawals as well as lifetime withdrawals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I expect to see more research from us there. One thing we would like to do in the future is to incorporate annuities or to think about how having an annuity might affect someone's withdrawal system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3406" target="_blank">00:56:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I would expect to see more from us in that area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B98fyyS9Aks&t=3410" target="_blank">00:56:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Christina, it's been wonderful having you on Bogleheads on Investing again.
