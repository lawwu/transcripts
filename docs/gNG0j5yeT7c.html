It was called Lemonade Salt. So on those really hot days, I think that was a really good one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">To be honest, uh, when they announced that Lemonade Salt was their newest flavor, Jesse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm kind of glad they chose that over the, the flavor I had suggested to the executives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">which was tobacco diaper.

I have not been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">in recent years as I guess, I'm trying to be accommodating. I have not been as firm as I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">should be with just, these are my deep work hours and I do deep work. And that's just that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people will be annoyed and that's just what it is. I mean, I'm the guy who wrote the book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Deep Work. So you can't say you weren't warned. I'm trying to hold the line on that this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">First thing in the morning, I do my deep work hours. There are two exceptions I have to work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">around. Our faculty meetings are once a month, but they're held in the morning on Fridays. But I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">worked it out that I can get up and start writing right away and make it to the faculty meeting having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">got in like a reasonable deep work block. So I don't have to break that chain. So now I'm really down to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">just the end of semester school events for my kids, because they often hold those right after school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">starts. So parents can come in and do that before work. That makes it impossible. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to be at those.

So I'm going to try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to hold the line on that. The problem is by the time I made that decision, I already had a non-trivial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">number of things scheduled in the morning for the next month or so. So I'm holding the line now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but it might not be for another few weeks until I'm in a territory where that's being preserved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing is I'm trying to do what I call a studio day, where I dedicate an entire day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the same day every week, just to doing the stuff related to the outreach to the public. So working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">on podcast scripts, writing my newsletter, any of the sort of stuff that surrounds that. Instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">making that ad hoc, have a day. And I've announced this. I've told like my department chair, like I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">a studio day. This is part of my job as a digital ethicist and in the Center for Digital Ethics to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">outreach about technology and its impacts. There's a day where the office I'm working out of is my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">office here in Tacoma Park, where my studio is. And I don't schedule any other meetings on this day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And that I'm trying, but as Jesse knows, I've been struggling with this because as soon as I declared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that, I already had for the next couple of months, stuff that fell on every day. So again, it won't be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">until October, until any of this becomes steady.

And then, here's the thing. I get chirped at so much now by so many people from so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">different walks of life, from like national level commentators, to just random people that we know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to random strangers.

I want to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm writing every single day and that the outreach part of my media company gets a full day of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">attention.

And I'm curious, what did your ideal lifestyle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">look like back then? How has it evolved since? And what changes do you make to where you are today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Does some of this get answered in your upcoming book?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2978" target="_blank">00:49:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It's an interesting question. I haven't gone back and listened to that episode in a while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">because the mic wasn't great and the audio is a little live. So where I recorded that first episode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">this would have been late spring. It was like May, 2020.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Right in the middle of COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Right in the middle of COVID. And the county we live in, in Maryland, Montgomery County</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">was all in on like, if you even open your blinds, you probably should go to Guantanamo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it was very much like just locked down and everyone was trying to out lock down each other to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I don't, I guess, signal their worthiness or whatever. So like, this is, this is terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So we, we rented a house down in Southern Maryland where no one, no one cares about anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's just, it's empty, whatever. It's not like we were there all the time. It was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">we temporarily had a second house we could go down to. And it was a weird piece of property</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">because it was like a, just a modest house. And then not making this up, uh, an airstrip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a runway, but it was all grass, but like cut out of the trees, runway, like so really long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the end of the runway, it was on water and you can, there's a fire pit down there and there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">like water and they had, uh, golf carts cause it was so far away. So you would ride the golf carts down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3064" target="_blank">00:51:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to the end of this runway. And there was like water down there. It was, we just wouldn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we just spend more and more time at this crazy property. So we've got to have space and be outside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and they opened up stuff there like way sooner. So I could go back to like museums and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about this before, but I went to five museums in like three weeks when they opened up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">again in, you know, that's where I recorded the first episode on a table in that house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a hard table on a hard floor.

So that's why I haven't listened to it. Uh, I will say in the pandemic is when I set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">like a lot of the pieces that became part of my ideal lifestyle vision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that I've made huge progress on, but continue to pursue a lot of those pieces came down in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">pandemic. So that was a definitely a face shift point in like whatever my, my ideal lifestyle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">vision was.

Is there a reason you don't create more columns in Trello and use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4035" target="_blank">01:07:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">method? It seems like it would be a more efficient way to review these tasks, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">When doing daily and weekly planning and dealing with a really big list of possible activities and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4046" target="_blank">01:07:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">projects.

Well, for my professional task, when organized in Trello, I do have many columns. I also have many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4060" target="_blank">01:07:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">boards.

So I tend in the professional context to have a board for each major role. So I'm director of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4074" target="_blank">01:07:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">undergraduate studies for the computer science department. That's a different role than say a role</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4078" target="_blank">01:07:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">working in the Center for Digital Ethics or my role working as an algorithm researcher. So give them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4083" target="_blank">01:08:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a separate board. I only want to see things related to a given role at one time. And so when I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4091" target="_blank">01:08:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">service that role, that's what I'm doing this afternoon, then let me just see those things. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4096" target="_blank">01:08:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">then within those boards, I have a lot of columns. And there's like classic columns, like make sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4101" target="_blank">01:08:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of, I haven't processed it yet. There's like sort of urgent working on this week, but I have a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4105" target="_blank">01:08:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like waiting to hear back from is in there. I sent an email to someone I'm waiting to hear back. Let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">remind myself of what that is and what I'm going to do when I hear back to discuss that next meeting for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4115" target="_blank">01:08:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">like any regular meetings in my life assigned for that role. I'll have a column, right? So my director of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4120" target="_blank">01:08:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">undergraduate studies, there's, I have meetings with my associate director every week. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4124" target="_blank">01:08:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">every other week I meet with my department chair. I keep track of, for both of those things, things I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4130" target="_blank">01:08:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">want to talk about at that next meeting. That saves me a ton of email, by the way. So instead of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">just sending the people's instinct is as soon as I think of something, let me email my department chair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, it's off my hands. But now you've just added another email to the thousand that she's going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4143" target="_blank">01:09:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and she's responds. And now like you have to work this out, not at the time you want to, but whenever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4148" target="_blank">01:09:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">these emails move back and forth. So instead you put on a card, talk at next meeting. When you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4152" target="_blank">01:09:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to the meeting, you go through them all. It gives you relief. You can have columns for like particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4157" target="_blank">01:09:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">projects that are going on. If it's like, this is like a time sensitive, complicated project that I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4162" target="_blank">01:09:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we're trying to get this conference together. Great. Here's a separate column over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4165" target="_blank">01:09:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So I can just keep track of those things. So create as many columns as you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4168" target="_blank">01:09:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and create different boards for different contexts. I think all of this helps. So lots of things together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4175" target="_blank">01:09:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that have unrelated contexts, you all have to look at the same time. That can be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4179" target="_blank">01:09:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that can be really overwhelming. So I'm not sure where you got the idea that I have a very small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4183" target="_blank">01:09:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">number of total columns I use. I have a ton in my, in my Trello universe. All right. We got our final</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4192" target="_blank">01:09:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">segment coming up. The books I read in August, but first something even more exciting, a word from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4198" target="_blank">01:09:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">another one of our sponsors.

So here's what I'm trying to say. It's hard to run a small business. So when you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4234" target="_blank">01:10:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">find decisions that are no brainers, you should take them. And when it comes to selling things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4240" target="_blank">01:10:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">using Shopify is exactly one of those no brainers.

So he got really involved in that. Um, and then most famously later in life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4674" target="_blank">01:17:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">working with his son, who was a geologist or something like this, he, they were the ones who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4680" target="_blank">01:18:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">advanced the asteroid killing the dinosaurs theory. So this was their working together, really made this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">argument based off of, uh, the iridium and the KT layer. They really began to, they pushed the argument, which,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4696" target="_blank">01:18:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we grew up with it, you and I like, yeah, the dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4702" target="_blank">01:18:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What I don't think we realized growing up, that was a brand new theory when we were growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4707" target="_blank">01:18:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like in the early nineties, late eighties, that was still being debated. So like we grew up and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4712" target="_blank">01:18:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they're like, yeah, like the asteroid killed the dinosaurs. That wasn't like, yeah, we've known this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4716" target="_blank">01:18:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">since the 1950s. In the nineties still, they are like actively making this argument. So anyways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4722" target="_blank">01:18:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought it was cool. So that was interesting. It was interesting to hear about him. Um, Alvarez,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4727" target="_blank">01:18:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting guy, did a lot of deep work.

This is the mindset I was in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4742" target="_blank">01:19:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I was reducing my stress.

So this is a similar, this is a more legitimate book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4755" target="_blank">01:19:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, no, the Fox Nolte is a legitimate book too.

They, they,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4869" target="_blank">01:21:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">they purchased surplus technology that was used in the Polaris, Polaris, uh, nuclear ballistic missile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4876" target="_blank">01:21:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">program.

And in audio animatronics, they said, what we'll do is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4899" target="_blank">01:21:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, for each movement, we'll have like a tone. And if we have a multi-track tape, we can fit a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4905" target="_blank">01:21:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">of tones on here. In fact, we can overlap some tones on the same tape because there are different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4909" target="_blank">01:21:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">frequency bands that, that are, um, they don't, they constructively, we can kind of furrier transform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4915" target="_blank">01:21:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">them back out again. Like we can, we can store multiple frequency bands on the same, uh, channel and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4919" target="_blank">01:21:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">then still isolate both of them. Um, and so what the, what they then had is, so you're recording</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4924" target="_blank">01:22:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">these tones on audio tape for all the different motions. You want these, uh, it's valves opening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4931" target="_blank">01:22:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and shutting to move things. Then they had these things that Motorola had invented for their, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4936" target="_blank">01:22:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">push to talk radios called tone reads. So you have the sound that's kind of like wired,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4942" target="_blank">01:22:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going over an analog cable into these tone reads and it vibrates, different frequencies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4947" target="_blank">01:22:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">vibrate different reads. And when it vibrates, it closes a circuit. And that circuit can then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4952" target="_blank">01:22:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">when it closes, can open and close a valve to move something. So they've, the, the program for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4957" target="_blank">01:22:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">these birds was on an audio tape. And you, this tape is playing and they have these huge banks of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4963" target="_blank">01:22:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">tone reads that are vibrating different frequencies that are opening and closing valves. And they could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4969" target="_blank">01:22:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">fit something like 128 or 200 different kind of sub tracks of tones on there. And it's exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4975" target="_blank">01:22:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">synchronized to the sound because one of the tracks is just like the sound. So like it's exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4979" target="_blank">01:22:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">synchronized to it. So they kind of invented that was, they were using this to control missiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4983" target="_blank">01:23:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and they, they use this for this, but then for Pirates of the Caribbean, there's too many figures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4988" target="_blank">01:23:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for this, right? So Pirates of the Caribbean, now we're talking like 62. There's too many figures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4994" target="_blank">01:23:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and they have audio tape and it's constant. It's not like shows like they're constantly moving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=4998" target="_blank">01:23:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're like, we can't just constantly be playing this audio tape. And there's too many figures to try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5002" target="_blank">01:23:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">program. So they went to something more simple there. It was each of the feet and their motions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5007" target="_blank">01:23:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">were much simpler because you only passed them briefly. So they made physical discs that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5013" target="_blank">01:23:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">like bumps up and down. And when the bump happens, like different valves open and close. And they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5019" target="_blank">01:23:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">had like these, you'd have these big racks full of discs with bumps, like big records really. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5025" target="_blank">01:23:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">would just turn and push a stylus up and down, or there would be holes and you would, they would have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5029" target="_blank">01:23:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">photo thing under it, but just physical discs that would turn. And each one would have like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5033" target="_blank">01:23:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it would take two minutes to go around. And that's like two minutes of activity. So you would have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5038" target="_blank">01:23:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">whole stack of these discs for all the different motors on one Pirate. And it was like a much more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5042" target="_blank">01:24:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">durable thing because it was really physical, right? And then by like the seventies, you could just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5047" target="_blank">01:24:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">zeros and ones on a computer, just loading the memory and the computer could just do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5051" target="_blank">01:24:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So like this type of stuff is really interesting to me. My wife thought it was crazy. Like, what are you reading?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5055" target="_blank">01:24:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, this book is beautiful. It's a hardcover, beautifully produced. It's hard to get. I had to order it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5061" target="_blank">01:24:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, not through Amazon, through some other means. Beautiful hardcover, uh, embossed hard, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5068" target="_blank">01:24:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">cloth hardbound, you know, with like the Tiki bird in or this or that self-published as far as I can tell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5072" target="_blank">01:24:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a labor of love. Really? Yeah. There was no publisher. I think this, this, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5078" target="_blank">01:24:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Brad Bird, the director wrote, wrote the introduction.

All right. Then I read a fun novel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5087" target="_blank">01:24:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">which I got in Bethany. There's a good bookstore in Bethany called Beach Reads, which they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5092" target="_blank">01:24:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">carry my books, but they do have, uh, beach reads a novel, a lot of novels or this or that. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5098" target="_blank">01:24:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and I got a book randomly off the shelf impulse by desperation reef by T Jefferson Parker. It's like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5105" target="_blank">01:25:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">procedural thriller family. They're surfers. There's like, I don't know, intrigue and their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5113" target="_blank">01:25:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">criminal syndicate like burns down their restaurant.

It's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5120" target="_blank">01:25:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then finally I read, uh, shift by Hugh Howie. So I mentioned my, one of my kids read the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5125" target="_blank">01:25:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Hugh Howie trilogy, which is the, on Apple TV, the series is silo, but he wrote the wool trilogy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG0j5yeT7c&t=5131" target="_blank">01:25:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">back in the day.
