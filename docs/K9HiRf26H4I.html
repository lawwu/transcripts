Shallow risk, which is a loss of real capital, but it's recovered in a relatively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">short period of time, say within a few years.

So Bernstein's whole point is that if you're managing for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">short-term spending needs, you have to follow shallow risk, while long-term spending needs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to be guided by deep risk. So the moral of the story is, if you're a young saver,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">your biggest asset is human capital, right?

If you're an older investor, you still want to have a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">bit of money in stocks, as we talked about before, but you have short-term spending needs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and you might not be able to wait out a bear market as long. So I totally agree with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">rule of thumb, but let's throw up the second question, because it's kind of a similar one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then before I get in, we can answer these both at the same time.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there have been 34 years with gains in excess of 20% over the last 95 years. That's more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">than a third of the time. 26 down years in that time, which is around 25% of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So not too bad.

I think the optimal portfolio for anyone with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a time horizon that's multiple decades should be mostly equities, but sometimes your emotions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hijack you and don't allow you to get to those long-term decade periods. So, John, do a chart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">onto the next one. That's just the drawdown. Even when we have gains, we've shown this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">before, the blue lines are the gains, the red dots are the entry-year peak-to-drop losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Since 1928, the average loss is like 16% a year, a little more than 16% a year.
