And the first manifestation was when India and Pakistan, which both went nuclear full scale in the late 1990s. But then in 1999, there was a border conflict between the two countries, and Pakistan came up with a whole new argument about nuclear deterrence.</p><p>Not only could you prevent a nuclear escalation, but if you kept your deterrent in place, you could have a conventional war with the other side not willing to escalate to nuclear because you still had your nuclear arsenal. Putin, or someone in the Russian complex, picked up on that new approach, and it's the one Putin is using now.</p><p>He's basically saying, "I'm having a conventional war here, and don't you dare introduce nuclear weapons, or I will. In fact, if you defeat me, I may introduce nuclear weapons. Screw you. I'm going to use my nukes as a backup." That's new, and it's terrifying because it's a totally different kind of deterrence that risks going too far too fast to be able to know what's going on.</p><p>I mean, this has gotten really very hairy. It used to be pretty straightforward. Don't bomb us, or we'll bomb you. Attack in some peripheral country, and we won't bomb you because you might bomb us. We'll lose that little war, but we'll come in somewhere else. All of these things, that's complicated enough, but now we're talking about this other level.</p><p>You know, the Soviets had millions of men in their army after World War II stationed in Eastern Europe. What was it, like 2 million people in the Red Army or something? Yeah. And we said, we didn't have the troops remaining in Western Europe, but we said, "Listen, if you invade Western Europe, we'll respond with a nuclear attack." That worked until August 1949, when the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb.</p><p>And that's when panic hit Washington, and the whole debate went on about, "Do we build hydrogen bombs?" But there had been a balance of forces. You're quite right. They had 2 million men on the ground in Europe. We had the bomb. And then the balance of force was disrupted when they got the bomb.</p><p>So then how do we rebalance? And the rebalance was the hydrogen bomb. And that's, you know, that's how you get to Armageddon, ultimately. It's only by having a Democles sword over our heads, the potential for world destruction, or at least of the human world, that it's possible to limit war in this way.</p><p>And when people start saying, "Well, look, we can have a conventional war if we've got nuclear weapons, because you're not going to attack us. You don't dare. We'll use our nuclear weapons on you." Something's changed most recently in all of this. It's outside the range of all the books I've written.</p><p>It's a whole new thing. Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
