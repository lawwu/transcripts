I'm sure you think about it. I think Warren is much more, uh, fixed in his mind about what he's going to do. And that's why when people say, well, we ought to write a story about who's going to succeed Warren Buffett, I say, you know, it's just kind of ridiculous to say that because he isn't going to retire. And if he doesn't retire, if he, say he runs Berkshire 10 years more, the whole set of people who might succeed him will have changed. And so it's ridiculous to write a story about that. I agree. It's very simple. The, uh... You know, I'm having the time of my life. At some point, your mind goes. I mean, and I've told my kids, I think it was David Ogilvie that says, develop your peculiarities when you're young. That way when you get older, people won't think you're going gaga. So I did that. I followed that advice. But my children will come in to me at some point. I've told all three to come in at the same time and tell me, you know, you're going gaga, daddy. And if only one of them comes in, they're out of the will. So they have to come in and ask. But it's... Uh-huh. The truth is, in terms of managing money or even managing a business, depending on the nature of the business and the way it's managed, age really isn't much of a deterrent. It's a deterrent to everything else. I mean, you know, I mean, in terms of eye-to-eye coordination, balance, all kinds of things. But in terms of getting the most out of other people, which is what my job is, and in terms of allocating capital, so far it hasn't been a deterrent. You know, who knows what happens next week. But you have a contingency plan. In terms of governance. Oh, it's total. I mean, if I die tonight, tomorrow morning there will be a CEO named... Every board knows exactly who it is. If for some reason that person's unavailable, they know another one. I mean, it's what we spend a majority of our time on. You have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing. And it's totally true. And the reason is because it's so hard that if you don't, any rational person would give up. It's really hard. And you have to do it over a sustained period of time. So if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it, you don't really love it, you're going to give up. And that's what happens to most people, actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up, you know, being successful, unquote, in the eyes of society, and the ones that didn't, oftentimes it's the ones that are successful loved what they did so they could persevere when it got really tough. And the ones that didn't love it quit. Because they're sane. Right? Who would want to put up with this stuff if you don't love it? So it's a lot of hard work. And it's a lot of worrying constantly. And if you don't love it, you're going to fail. So you've got to love it. You've got to have passion. And I think that's the high order bit. The second thing is you've got to be a really good talent scout. Because no matter how smart you are, you need a team of great people. And you've got to figure out how to size people. Right? Size people up fairly quickly. Make decisions without knowing people too well. And hire them. And see how you do. And refine your intuition. And be able to help build an organization that can eventually just build itself. Because you need great people around you. I want to talk about the fact that this is my last keynote. And it's the middle of this year in July. And I'm going to talk about the fact that I moved from being a full-time employee at Microsoft to working full-time at the foundation, as you heard. And so this will be the first time since I was 17 that I won't have my full-time Microsoft job. And I'm not really sure what that last day is going to be like. It could be a bit strange. What do you do on your last day? So I asked some friends to help me prepare for that. And so we got together and did a little video. So let's take a look at that. It is a day the industry never thought would come. Join us all day as we report on Bill Gates' last full day at Microsoft. It's been in the planning for the past two years. He'll still be active as chairman. It's hard to believe it's really here. Yeah, I think Bill's ready for his last day. He's worked pretty hard, saved a little bit. He is completely focused. I mean, Bill's been going all out for more than 30 years. So not having a completely full schedule every day has been a little, well, interesting. Never doubt the magic of software. That's right, listen to Chewbacca. You know, after all these years, he's finally taking work-life balance seriously. He's even got a personal trainer. All right, that's good. One in a row. When you keep this up, you're gonna get sexiest man alive next year, bro. That's good for the set, man. You wanna let it go or you wanna keep going? Well, am I ready to take my shirt off? Um, not yet. Feel yourself going back, lean a little forward. Just think high, H-I, to the sky. You and I. Right now. Yeah, Bill's always been a bit of a ham. But more importantly, it's the creative risks he takes that really set him apart. Big pimpin', I'm Bill G. Big pimpin', yeah, you know me. That's it. Got it. Killed it, Billy G. Hey, let me get one thing straight with you. You can retire and then un-retire? Exactly. Gotta keep 'em guessing. Thanks, Jay. No, it was great. Not so much. It's hot, though. Somebody gotta tell 'em. It was horrible. What's new? Here. Just take that. Hello, Bill? Yeah, yeah. Bill, I'm a little busy here. Dude! Wasn't that the craziest riff you've ever heard? Oh, for f---'s sake. Bill, we've, um, we've talked about this before. Um, we're full up in the band. Bill? All positions are filled. Uh-huh, huh? I know, I know, but I can't just replace Edge because you got a high score on Guitar Hero, Bill. Look, I mean, Bill's always had a passion for guitar. Bill's always had a passion for music. And as long as it's not my music, I'm fine with that. Bill's always been a big fan of the movies. But he's probably gone a bit too far with this whole audition reel thing. Who are you expecting? Superman? Bill, what money can't buy? Oh. Yeah, I just watched it. Yeah, look, we all know it's all about casting anyway, right? I know, Steven, I can't, it's just, I can't play Bill Gates. It's, uh, it's just not something I'm good at. I want you, Russell Crowe, to do it. You'd be, oh, dead, yeah. How about Tom Hanks? You'd be, you were passed on that one, too. Hey, I, I was thinking the last time I was on the show, I, I thought it was really successful. Yeah, no, you were great on the show, man. We loved it. It was, although, you know, you did kind of run off at the end, like I, you know, had monkey pox. Windows Vista on sale. Oh, he's leaving! You want to come back on the show? That's fine. That's, uh, you know, we... Maybe we could make it sort of a regular thing, like... You, me, the, the news. A co-anchor kind of a situation. It's, it's a great idea. I gotta tell you, it's a, it's a great idea. It's, uh, the only thing is, I'm on my jet right now, and they... I'm worried the phone will, they have to turn it off or it will throw off the navigation system. On the, the ding-ding. And you didn't hear this from me. It's a pretty strange coincidence that his transition date is right in the middle of the 2008 presidential campaign. I, I know you're super busy, but I, I'm sure you're starting to think about who would be your best running mate. No, I, I know I haven't actually declared a running mate yet, Bill, but I'm not sure politics is really for you. Hey, it's Bill. Bill Shatner of Star Trek? No, the other Bill. Bill Clinton? Oh, hey Bill. No, it's not an inconvenient time. Yeah, I, I get it. You know, that was a good one. Of course, we'll miss him in the daily brainstorming meetings. He's always been an innovator, really inspiring all of us to think creatively about the future. And we'll be the first to give credit where credit is due. Oh, absolutely. Microsoft Bob? His idea. Yeah, I'm sure he'll be a good friend. Microsoft Bob? His idea. All his. Like I said, we've been planning for this. But he's still Bill. And we'll miss seeing him in the hallway every day. Hey, buddy. See you tomorrow at the board meeting. And all tech markets remain steady as Bill Gates completed his historic last full day at Microsoft. Personal note, all of us here at NBC News will miss reporting every night on this brilliant, powerful, let's face it, sexy and good-looking leader of men and women who just doesn't believe in paying more than $7 for a haircut. I'm Brian Williams in New York. Good night. You probably know Bill Gates. Bill Gates as the founder of Microsoft, the hard-driving tech executive whose software fueled the personal computer revolution. You might also know him as the longtime richest man in the world who left Microsoft five years ago so he could work full-time giving his money away. We had the chance to witness Bill Gates 2.0, the man you don't know. He has driven as much as anyone we have ever met to make the world a better place. Gates told us why he thinks inventions are the key to success and just what he intends to accomplish with his time, intellect and $67 billion fortune. Starting with his plans to knock out some of the world's deadliest diseases. The story will continue in a moment. You're going to spend the next 20 years of your life trying to eradicate disease, yes? Yep. That's your mission? That'll be the majority of my time. Starting with polio? Get it done by 2018. Tuberculosis? That one, we'll have to see how the tools go. The current tools are not good enough to do an eradication. They're good enough to reduce the deaths very dramatically. But we'll need a few better tools that'll take probably six or seven years. Malaria? Malaria is the one that the tools are being invented now, 15 or perhaps even 20 years. But start to really shrink that map. These are the people Gates wants to help. They are what he calls the bottom two billion, a third of the world's population that struggles on less than $2 a day. They are poor, hungry, lack electricity and clean water. Gates' most urgent goal, help the millions of children under five who die every year, one every 20 seconds, from preventable diseases. No one alive. No one alive. that I know of has said, my goal is to eradicate a disease, and then another disease, and then another disease. This is somebody that dreams high. - Yeah, because I'm excited about that, and it's doable. - Today, Gates spends most of his time here at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle. He runs it with his father, Bill Sr., and his wife, Melinda, whom he credits with being a driving force behind the foundation. There are over 1,100 employees to help them decide which programs to fund. But Gates still visits sites around the world to see what's working and what's not. - I welcome Bill Gates to our school. The government of Ghana and all school-age children are grateful for your support. - Very well done. Great to be here. - The grants here go towards school nutrition. - This is spinach. - Improving agriculture. - We don't have enough water in the river. - We don't have enough water in the river. - And most important to Gates, life-saving vaccines. - There you go. Thank you. - Yeah. - Okay. - Well, whenever you see a mother bringing a sick child into a facility, it's easy to relate to, what if that was my child? You realize how crazy it is that with the world being rich enough to afford all sorts of frivolous things, that those basic things still aren't being provided. - But providing vaccines throughout the developing world, - Yeah. - is a great thing. - Yeah. - The developing world is no simple task. So Gates has set up his foundation to run like Microsoft. He insists on strict accounting. And when a problem arises, he pulls in the best people to find solutions. We saw a good example of that when it comes to vaccines. To be effective, they need to be kept cold. - So this is using electricity. - But that's tough in hard to reach areas where refrigerators are rare and unreliable. Back in Seattle, Gates turned to scientists at a company called Intellectual Ventures, where he is both an investor and an inventor. They created a super thermos using the same technology that protects spacecraft from extreme heat. Using only a single batch of ice, it can keep vaccines cold for 50 days. So here is the thermos. - That's right. This holds vaccines for over 200 children, and it doesn't require any batteries, batteries, batteries, any battery, any energy. Its walls have been designed to be such a good thermos that even in very, very hot days, inside it will stay cold enough to make the vaccines work. And then when you want to take them out, you just go in here, and there's a whole tray of the vaccines. You take them out, it records everything you've done with it, the temperature. So it's a replacement for all those refrigerators that have been so unreliable. I mean, just look at this thing. When we take it out in the field, people go, "Oh, that's amazing. You can't do that." - No matter how perfect the vaccine, if you can't get it to the people who need it, it ain't doing no good. - That's right. And now, you know, we need to get it to every child in the world. - Gates is betting technology will solve other age-old problems like sanitation. Two and a half billion people around the world do not have adequate toilets. That means streams and rivers get clogged with debris and human waste, becoming breeding grounds for disease. - The toilet is one of those things that's like a vaccine, where it really would change the situation. - So Gates launched a global competition: design a toilet that works without plumbing. - We had over 20 entrants. We gave four top prizes. Some of them used burning, some of them used the laser approach. There were quite a few novel ideas of how you reinvent the toilet. And so, this was one of the best ideas. - It's one of the prototype designs of what a good-looking new toilet would look like. It actually processes everything down in here and then recycles water. Over the next four or five years, we think we can have a toilet that's every bit as good as the flush toilet. - You can learn a lot about what motivates Bill Gates by visiting his private office. He showed us why he draws inspiration from the Italian genius Leonardo da Vinci. In 1994, Gates bought da Vinci's 500,000 year old notebook. - He had an understanding of science that was more advanced than anybody of the time. The notebook we have here is one where he's thinking about water, and he's looking at how it flows when it hits barriers and it goes around, comes back together. He's actually trying to understand turbulence. How should you build a dam? How does it erode away? - It cost $30 million at auction, making it the most valuable manuscript in the world. For Gates, it is priceless. - It's an inspiration that one person, off on their own, with no positive feedback, nobody ever told him what was right or wrong, that he kept pushing himself, found knowledge in itself to be a beautiful thing. - Gates scoffs at any comparison to the great Leonardo, but a look around his private office reveals a man equally obsessed with understanding his world. - Can I look at these? - Sure. This is the weather one, meteorology. - Yeah. - The very first course that I watched is this geology course. - This is a whole series on the joy of science, mathematics, philosophy in the real world. - Gates' collection of DVDs contains hundreds of hours of college lectures that this famous Harvard dropout has watched. - The more you learn, the more you have a framework that the knowledge fits into. - When he's on the road, Gates, who's a speed reader, lugs around what he calls his reading bag. When he finishes a book, he posts his thoughts on his website, Gates Notes. - What I'll do is I'm reading these books. - Oh, look at that. - I'll take notes. - Oh, these are your notes already. - Right. - Look at this. - No, I love to take notes on books. So I just haven't written it up yet. - How long will it take to read all of this? - Oh, a long time. Thank goodness for vacations. I read a lot. - But Gates isn't just reading books for pleasure. He is determined to use his knowledge to back groundbreaking innovations. Take this high-tech zapper. It is a laser designed to shoot down malaria-infected mosquitoes in mid-flight. And Gates showed us one of his boldest and he says most important ventures, a new kind of nuclear reactor. It would burn depleted uranium, making it cleaner, safer, and cheaper than today's reactors. - And your fuel lasts for 60 years. And so during that entire time, you don't need to open it up, refuel it. You don't need to buy more fuel. There's a certain simplicity that comes with this design. - And when could it come on stream? - Best case would be to have a prototype around 2022. - Bill Gates calls himself an impatient optimist, a description his wife, Melinda, says was accurate even when they met over 20 years ago. - Melinda, what did you like about him? - Just his curiosity and his optimism about life and this belief that you can change things. I mean, he believed that clearly. And clearly at Microsoft, he was changing the world with software and he knew it. - Is the curiosity a shared curiosity or are there different curiosities? - Well, we both have curiosity for lots of things. Bill, at this stage in our life, also gets more time to read than I do, quite honestly, with three kids in the house. But the great thing is Bill will go read an entire book about fertilizer. And I can tell you, even without three kids in the house, I'm not gonna read a book about fertilizer. But he loves to teach. And so as long as I have time, we'll spend time talking about that. - What is it about a book about fertilizer? I mean, seriously. - Fertilizer is very interesting. We couldn't feed, a few billion people would have to die if we hadn't come up with fertilizer. - How do you find a balance in all this? Father, chairman of a major company, a foundation, and then all these other ventures. How's the balance come to you? - I don't mow the lawn. - You found somebody to do that? - Absolutely. - He's come a long way from that teenage prodigy obsessed with writing computer code. Over nearly four decades, we've watched Bill Gates help lead the digital revolution with what he now admits was a fanatic and relentless determination. - You guys never understood. You never understood the first thing about this. - I'm not doozin' this thing. - In the early years, there was a demanding guy, there was a driven guy, there was an obsessed guy, there was some say an arrogant guy. Have you changed? - I've certainly learned. I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered and not be so selfish. I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered and not be so selfish. I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered and not be so selfish. I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered and not be so selfish. I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered and not be so selfish. I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered and not be so selfish. I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered and not be so selfish. I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered. - Look, I wouldn't have married Bill if there wasn't a huge heart. With all the adjectives you just used about how he drove his career, which was very successful for Microsoft, there was an enormous heart always there. - No question Gates has softened with age. Just listen to how he reflected on his often tumultuous relationship with the late Apple CEO, Steve Jobs. - He and I, in a sense, grew up together. We were within a year of the same age and we were kind of naively optimistic and built big companies. We achieved all of it, and most of it as rivals, but we always retained a certain respect, communication, including even when he was sick, I got to go down and spend time with him. - And talked about what? - Oh, about what we'd learned, about families, anything. - Today, Gates says he gets advice on patience and generosity from his friend Warren Buffett, who seven years ago entrusted the majority of his fortune to the Gates Foundation. And from his father, Bill Senior, a lawyer who prodded his son into giving his money away. - You've said before, this is your hero. Why? - Well, my dad has integrity. He's got a humble approach to things. He's calm and wise about things. It's just a huge influence to always, you know, want to live up to a great example. - Someone said to me, "Your son may be the most influential person in the 21st century." - I can only say yes. - He's determined, as he already has proven, that he can dramatically reduce the number of kids under five who die. You can't do any better than that, can you? - That's right. That's right. There's no way to be unimpressed about that. - You couldn't be more proud. - I couldn't be more proud. That is exactly true. - That is absolutely true. - Go to 60minutesovertime.com to hear more about the great rivalry and friendship between... - You're working at two companies simultaneously, which is kind of extraordinary in itself. You have this amazing way of... You spent... Just talk really quickly about how you balance those two. I think it's kind of interesting. - Yeah, so I... The only way to do this is to be very disciplined and very practiced. And the way I found that works for me is I theme my days. So on Monday at both companies, focus on management and running the company, which is, you know, we have our directional meeting at Square, and we have our OpCom meeting at Twitter. I do all my management one-on-ones on that day. Tuesday is focused on product. Wednesday is focused on marketing and communications and growth. Thursday is focused on developers and partnerships. And Friday is focused on the company and the culture and recruiting. And Saturday I take off. I hike. And then Sunday is reflection, feedback, strategy, getting ready for the rest of the week. And there's interruptions all the time, but... I can quickly deal with an interruption and then know that it's Tuesday, I have product meetings, and I need to focus on product stuff. It also sets a good cadence for the rest of the company so that we're always delivering, we're always showing, you know, where we were last week and where we're going to be the following week. So it's been good, but we're always evolving. - And you're splitting your time equally between the two? - Yep. - How many hours at each one? - Eight hours at each one, and I live across the street. - Eight hours at each one. - Okay. - So you're a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So you're a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So I'm a lot of work. - Yeah. - So you work out three times a day? - Two or three, but they're very short. Some of these workouts might only be 10, 15 minutes, keep in mind, especially in the morning. - Sure. - It's the greatest mental performance enhancer possible, physical exercise, really not separating the brain and other organs. And then I will have, after working out, I'll have a nice big meal and come home. And from about, I would say, 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM is generally allocated to spending time with friends. And I'll oftentimes have lunch with friends slash business associates. They're usually one and the same now. And then my most productive writing period, and I enjoy writing, as difficult as it is for me, my best writing period is from about, I would say midnight or 1:00 AM to 3:00, 4:00 AM. And so I'll generally sit down with a glass of wine or two, and some tea and write. And I'll put on a headset and usually play music off of Pandora, and I'll have a music in the, I'm sorry, a movie in the background playing on a big screen TV so that it feels like I'm in a social environment, even though the TV is actually muted. So that is my routine. - That's pretty interesting. I mean, the one thing that really strikes me is how you're able to focus on that writing. I mean, do you find it hard to stay away from distractions while you wanna focus? - Well, that's part of the reason I found that I get my best work done between 1:00 and 3:00 or 4:00 AM is that particularly since I'm on the West Coast, the options for procrastination and distraction are fewer. And whenever possible in my life, I try to control my environment rather than control my behavior. So I think that's changing your environment and designing your environment, and that includes schedule, is oftentimes much more effective than trying to rely on self-discipline for certain things. And I've really tried to follow that as much as possible, making it impossible for me to misbehave in other words. - Welcome, welcome, welcome.

Ketz-DeVry, who studies management psychology and is the author of a paper titled "Death and the Executive: Encounters with the Stealth Motivator." Work is a way of not thinking about it, as opposed to sitting on the golf course and having some drinks. It's about finding and having meaning. Though there are studies showing that the older executives get, the more risk-averse they become, potentially robbing shareholders of big acquisitions that could improve companies' bonds. And that's the bottom line. That drawback, some experts say, is ignored by corporate boards too worried about pushing out popular figures whose identities would vanish without their jobs. A report by the conference board, a business research group, showed that mandatory retirement policies are now seldom used. And the idea of everlasting work is filtering down to the lower executive ranks, with surveys by Gallup and others showing that large numbers of baby boomers intend to put off retirement because they find work rewarding, or because their retirement accounts took a beating in the recession. Some 10% of organizations now offer some form of phased retirement, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. "If you have reasonably good health and a real interest in what you're doing, there is no reason why you can't continue contributing for as long as you can," said Fred Malek, a close friend of Marriott and former president of the company. He's still working at age 77. People like Bill are lucky to have that. Marriott's everlasting career is somewhat rare when compared to Murdoch, Redstone, and Buffett, all of whom still wield considerable day-to-day control over their companies. Marriott stepping away was the subject of intense speculation over the years, especially after his son John left the company in 2005, leaving no other family member ready in age or experience to fill the top job. Marriott turned to Arne Sorensen, a young, well-liked executive he had personally groomed. Sorensen said he regularly consults with Marriott, whose office is just down the hall at the company's Bethesda, Maryland, headquarters, not because he has to, but because he wants to. Marriott, he added, remains deeply interested in hotel operations and isn't shy about bringing up ideas or problems. He attends monthly senior staff meetings. In Marriott, Sorensen has a counselor with such love and recall for details that in an interview he offered the secret to a famous hot shop's dessert. "The key to our hot fudge ice cream cake was to leave a spot in the middle of the cake, on the top, and not cover it with anything, so you could put your whipped cream and cherry on a dry spot. If you put it on top of the chocolate, it would slide off, and you wouldn't have good ice cream cake." "By hanging around, Marriott is hedging a bit and making sure his successor lands on his feet," said Donald C. Hambrick, a management professor at Penn State University who has studied lengthy executive tenures. "He is showing that he's pulling for Sorensen and doesn't want to leave him high and dry." Asked what he thinks Marriott gets out of his role, Sorensen said, "It keeps him young and active and engaged. He's a big competitor. He wants to win." His family thinks they win, too. "My dad will never stop working," said daughter Deborah Marriott Harrison, "and we're happy about that because he would probably curl up in the fetal position and die, because this company has been so much a part of his life." But he's no longer putting in 80 hours a week. They get more of him at home. "He's less preoccupied and more in the moment," Harrison said. "Earlier this year, Harrison saw him play a game with one of his 15 grandchildren, a fishing expedition with magnets. He and his granddaughter played for 45 minutes. Who won? 'Are you kidding?' Marriott said, laughing. 'She won.'" So contrast that article with this article right here. This is from a USA Today article on personal finance, published April 1, 2012. The writer is Nancy Helmick. This article pervades just about everywhere you look in the financial world. "Retirement: A third have less than $1,000 put away. Most people aren't trying to figure out how much they'll need in their golden years. Most people have very little tucked away for retirement, and many aren't even trying to figure out how much they'll need later in life," a new national survey reveals. "About 36% of workers have less than $1,000 in savings and investments that could be used for retirement, not counting their primary residence or defined benefit plans, such as traditional pensions, and 60% of workers have less than $25,000, according to a telephone survey of 1,000 workers and 501 retirees from the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald and Associates. Only 44% say they or their spouse have tried to calculate how much money they'll need to save by the time they retire so that they can live comfortably in their golden years," the survey shows. "Workers who have done calculations on what they need to save tend to have higher levels of savings than those who haven't crunched the numbers." Interesting little tidbit there in that sentence. "There's an incredible difference between those lucky enough to have a retirement plan and those who don't," says Jack Vander High. The Institute's research director and co-author of the 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey. "What's really striking is that 73% of those without a retirement plan are lucky enough to have a retirement plan."

Although the article is clearly a bit sarcastic, which is good for her, To me, that's a good overview of To me, that's a good overview of To me, that's a good overview of A good overview of A good overview of A good overview of A good overview of kind of the situation. And the author there, Mary Lou Weissman, writes a couple of important details, especially about the development of retirement in America. But a couple of key points I want to point out from that. In 1929, the American government in 1951, people still did not want to retire. And I feel like this is probably underrepresented in today's world. And, you know, I was born in the mid-80s and I grew up in a world thinking, "Well, everyone needs to retire." And all I stuffed into my head was retirement books about how to retire, with retirement kind of being painted as this golden prospect. with retirement kind of being painted as this golden prospect. I'm not so sure it is. And there are lots of strategies of how to deal with it. But there are a lot of changes that are happening. But there are a lot of changes that are happening. And I think that's a quick side trip. I kind of mocked this idea that the average person, that the average person, hardly anyone lived to be age 65 in 1883. hardly anyone lived to be age 65 in 1883. I'll give credit for this. I listened for a long time to a podcast called "The Survival Podcast" by a guy named Jack Spierka. And I'll give him credit for pointing it out to me. He pointed out in one of his shows that the statistics on lifespan are a little bit odd. Because we're taught that, you know, in the 1800s, hardly anybody lived to make it to the age of 65. And his point was that that's not true. Think of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and many of them lived past the age of 65. And so I thought that was kind of interesting. So I went one day and I did a research project just to kind of prove it to myself. And I went and I took and I wrote down all the signers of the Declaration of Independence and I calculated their average lifespan. And the reason I did that is because if you try to figure out okay, maybe the general population number was that amount, but why? And so is it the fact that we have great medications now? Or is it the fact that we have dry beds to sleep in? Is it the fact that we have awesome hospital services? Or is it the fact that we have adequate food? What's the actual answer here as far as what's the answer? And I'm certainly not sure of the answer. I don't know I certainly don't know what the actual answer is. But I did go and do this interesting chart and I'll share it with you. I made a list of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence and I calculated their average age. And the average age of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence ended up being 67.5 years. I took out the one but however obviously when you read through why different people died you have accidents, you have old age. And so I took out one single signer who died at age 30 of shipwreck. That was the one that was an accident that was very clear. That raised the average lifespan to 68.2. So the average lifespan of these people was 68.2. If you look down the list and I just pulled it up here on my computer If you look down the list some of the oldest ones well I'll just give you a few. So Josiah Bartlett died at 65.5 from poor health. So that would be kind of the normal old age. William Whipple died at 65.9 so 60 years old from heart disease. He had clogged arteries. Matthew Thornton died at 89 while visiting his daughter. John Adams died at 90 of a coma. Well he died while in a coma. Samuel Adams died at 81 from severe lung hemorrhage. Elbridge Gerry died at 70 in a excuse me I'm looking at my chart wrong. I'm going to put it in my notes that I took. Elbridge Gerry died at 70. John Hancock at 56. I'm not going to read all of these just a few noted ones. Francis Lewis died at 89. Benjamin Franklin died at 84. James Smith died at 87. Charles Carroll died at 95. Thomas Stone died at 44. Some of the older ones. George Wythe died at 80. And so you have a broad range of these people dying at relatively normal ages. Seems like one of the interesting things is that the gout was a major factor at that point in time. And that really affected a lot of these people's health. But the point is, I'm not sure. If anybody has any knowledge, share it with me. I'm interested in researching this. Because I personally think that it's possible that a lot of the increases in lifespan are just simply due to the more widespread the greater prevalence of a warm bed to sleep in at night to keep the rain off and enough food for people to eat. Rather than this idea that I've had in the past that it's just simply amazing medicine. I think it's much more basic than that. Probably the discovery of germ theory and warm beds to sleep in and enough food and enough nutrition is a compelling idea. Another article here that I think these articles do a good job of laying out in a short version. The history of retirement. This article is from the Seattle Times. Published December 31, 2013. And I don't see the author listed here. At least not on the top. This one's relatively short. A brief history of retirement. It's a modern idea. Work until you die or until you can't work anymore. Until the late 19th century, that was the old age plan for the bulk of the world's workers. Only in 1889 did German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduce modern pensions. Bismarck wasn't really motivated by compassion for the plight of the working class. He wanted to preempt a growing socialist movement in Germany before it grew any more powerful. The idea of providing financial security for the aged gradually caught on and expanded in Europe, the United States and other advanced economies. Now, as life expectancy reaches links Bismarck couldn't have imagined and retirement lasts two or three decades, these countries are struggling with government pension plans they can no longer afford. The pension Bismarck offered was the first to be widely available, but it was hardly the world's first. In 13 BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus began paying pensions to Roman legionnaires who had served 20 years. The troops' pensions were financed at first by regular taxes, then by a 5% inheritance tax, according to a 2009 history by Frank Eich, an economist now with the International Monetary Fund. In the 16th century, Britain and several European countries offered pensions to their troops, starting with officers and gradually expanding to enlisted men. The first civilian public servant known to have received a pension was an official with the London Port Authority. In 1684, he was paid half his working income, deducted from the pay of his replacement. Thomas Paine, the Revolutionary War firebrand, famous for his essay Common Sense, called for a 10% inheritance tax. Part of the tax was to be used to pay benefits to everyone age 50 and older to "guard against poverty in old age," according to a history by the Social Security Administration. The idea went nowhere. After the Civil War, the U.S. government paid pensions to disabled or impoverished Union veterans, or to the widows of the dead. Southern states paid pensions to disabled Confederate veterans. The Civil War pensions became a basis for Social Security decades later. When farming dominated the economy, most men worked as long as their health held out. As they aged, though, they often cut their hours and turned the most physically demanding chores over to sons or hired hands. In 1864, 1980, when half of Americans worked on a farm, 78% of American men worked past age 65. As factories began to replace farms and economic importance, skeptics wondered whether old folks could understand and work with the new machines. One of the giants of American medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital co-founder William Osler, in 1905 decried "the uselessness" of men older than 60 and said they should leave the work force. Growing prosperity also meant more people could afford to stop working late in life. In 1875, American Express offered America's first employer-provided retirement plan. Five years later, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad introduced the first retirement plan, financed jointly by contributions from an employer and its workers. From there, private pension plans grew. In the United States, the plans received a boost during World War II, when the government imposed wage freezes. That led some companies to offer pensions, and other benefits to attract scarce workers. That was a key development in retirement plan history right there. They weren't able to pay more wages, so the employers came and built up other ways of compensation, which really helped with fringe benefits. So pension contributions, other ancillary fringe benefits, health plans, etc. made a big difference there when that happened. The United States created Social Security in 1935 and added Medicare health benefits for the elderly in 1965. In the 1980s, many countries lowered the age at which people could retire and collect full benefits. This step was part of an effort to clear older workers out of the labor force to make way for the young. I'm going to pause and emphasize this. In the 1980s, many countries lowered the age at which people could retire and collect full benefits. This step was part of an effort to clear older workers out of the labor force to make way for the young. One of the things that I found researching retirement is that retirement has usually been used as punishment. I think it will be tomorrow when I go into some of the detailed history from this book, A History of Retirement. It's very interesting to see that retirement was originally intended, there's many reasons why, but one of the major factors originally intending, excuse me, originally affecting retirement was that retirement was intended to solve an employment problem. The idea was that, economically speaking, with industrialization, it was never going to be possible to have full employment. Especially during the Great Depression, the policy makers had decided it was never going to be possible again to have full employment. So they needed to reduce the number of people that were unemployed. One of the fastest ways that they chose to do that was to introduce and mandate at later dates the concept of retirement. Retirement was originally intended as a solution to the problem of employment. That's key. Don't rely on my statement, so I'll try to prove it to you tomorrow with some better research information. Finishing this article, now governments are reversing those policies and raising retirement ages to prevent aging populations from breaking their budgets. And older people who now enjoy better health are working longer again. In the United States, 18.6% of people 65 and older were working, or looking for work as of November. That was up from a record low 10.4% in January 1985, according to Labor Department figures dating to 1948. Why on earth do we have these constant articles decrying the retirement crisis? Many older people are enjoying, are working longer again. So we're going to talk about some alternate ways, because from a financial planning perspective, this opens up a huge, huge, huge number of opportunities for us to kind of reinvent, basically reinvent the entire concept of working. If we can get free of this concept of work for my lifetime and then I have to retire at 65, if we can get free of this concept, then we can completely re-engineer our lives in some really awesome ways, and we can take control of it again. Over the years of working as a financial planner, I've asked hundreds of people this question. It's kind of part of my standard fact-finding process. And the question is this: Is there a point in time at which you'd like to be in a position to not to have to work if you didn't want to? And kind of phrase it like that. To try to not be critical of, you know, do you want to retire? To try to kind of phrase it a little more elegantly. Or, you know, is there a point that you'd just like to work because you choose to, not because you want to? And almost universally, I get one of three answers. There are exceptions. The most common answer is, "Oh, yeah, definitely." And the follow-up question is, "Well, what age? When do you want to do that?" "Uh, you know, 65." That's by far the most common answer. I'm going to make up some percentages on the spot here. I would say that's probably 50% of the time. The second most common answer is, "No." Well, I mean, "Yeah, I'd like to have money, but no, I'm never going to quit." "You mean retire? I'm not going to quit." And that answer is probably the second most common. I make up a number that's 30%. Well, let's say 20%. And then the third most common answer is, "Yeah, absolutely. At what age?" "You know, maybe a little bit early. Like 60." And that's probably another 20%. So if I got my statistic, if I made up my percentages appropriately, that's 90%. The other 10% is various answers. And I always push back and say, "Why? Why 65?" "I don't know. You know, that's a good age, right? That's the Social Security age. You know, that's when I can collect Social Security." And the thing I always, I just feel like is a big deal to push back on is, "Why are we choosing the age of 65?" "Why? Why not 66? Why not 64? Why not 44? Why not 94?" I don't care what you choose. But don't just choose the answer because that's the convenient answer. Don't just say, "I'm going to make this retirement plan." Because here's what happens. I take that number and I go and create a written financial plan. And it shows that by the age of 65, you need, you know, $1.4 million. And I come back and I deliver the financial plan and I talk you through it. But the reality is, in order to accumulate the $1.4 million, you've got to be saving $1,000 a month. And then we don't follow through and do the savings. So... we've got to change that. And we've got to create individualized plans that are really compelling. And so whether that's, "I'm going to take a year off every 10." Whether that's, "I'm going to work and get early retirement." I don't know what the answer is. But there's lots of answers to it. I'll give you one of mine. This is me speaking personally. This whole "retire at 65" thing has never made sense to me. And the reason it doesn't make sense to me, primarily, is because of my personal family values. So I look at it and I say, "Why on earth should I do this?" So, go to school, Joshua. Graduate from high school. Go to college. Get a degree. Get out. Get a good job. Okay, I'm going to get a good job now. And now you need to really work hard on your job. So you should also, however, get married when you're in your early 20s and you should start a family. So now that's the career building time and that's when you've got a family. You need to work really, really hard so you have a bunch of money saved up so that at the age of 65 you can retire. So I work from let's say I got married and had kids at 25. So I work from 25 to 45 during those 20 most crucial years really building my career. I'm a workaholic always just slaving away at the office to allow me to save money. And I miss my kid's childhood. So I go to some soccer games from time to time and I get home at about 8 o'clock at night because I'm living on an airplane. But I miss my kid's childhood because I've got to build my career and I've got to save for retirement. So then about the age of 45, I'm ready to pull back a little bit. But now I look down and my kids are 14 years old. They don't want anything to do with me because I wasn't there. And now they're 14 years old and they're trying to establish their independence. And so here I am at the age of 45 and now I'm senior enough in my company that I can afford to pull back a little bit of all my time. And so I do that. But the problem is they don't care much about me. And then I keep working and I retire at 65 right when my kids are 25 years old and they're the ones that are working 25 to 45 years old and they're working to build their careers doing exactly what they watched me do. So I'm 65 so I can afford to sit around and do nothing. But my kids don't want anything to do with me so I have to go play nonstop. It doesn't make any sense to me. Why not just a very simple alternate plan? Why not simply say, "Okay, I'm going to graduate from college at 22 or whatever, work really hard for a few years, save a bunch of money, but then all during the time that my kids are growing up, why don't I pull back from the work? Why don't I pull back and spend time being present with them?" And then once the kids are starting to establish their independence, they're 14 years old, why not at that point in time then really pour on the effort at work? And forget this whole 65 thing. Why not just simply build a lifestyle and a career that allows me to integrate fully my life and my work? If it's good enough for Mr. Marriott and Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates, why is it not good enough for the rest of us? Now, there are a lot of alternate plans. So I love the early retirement concept. The concept that for example, Money Mustache -- hopefully we'll have him on the show at some point, I'd love to interview him -- but Money Mustache talks about he and his wife's plan. Their plan was to retire by the time they had kids. So they did it at 31. That's awesome! How cool is that? That works. And now they're home full-time raising their son. That's an awesome plan. It's a lot smarter than doing it at 65. So there are a number of there are a number of very -- of different plans that we have. But once we get out of this age 65 thing, then we create a dramatically different financial planning options. I'll read this article here, very short. But to me this is the constant. And over the next couple of decades it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse as the government balances -- the government debt balances get worse and worse and worse. Here's the constant refrain. This is from the BBC News. "Sinking of the Bismarck Legacy." Otto von Bismarck was the Prime Minister of Prussia before overseeing the unification of Germany. The German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced the world's first state pension system in the 1880s. You had to be 70 years old and the expectation was that you would probably only live a few years after that to collect it. But in 1916 they lowered the pensionable age to age 65. It has remained at 65 for almost a century and it will take a brave government to juggle with the political sensitivity of raising that age again. "It is a part of our political system and we pay for it. The employees, the employers, and the state," says Wolfgang Wipperman at the Berlin Free University. "They have to continue with this. Otherwise there will be a revolution of the pensioners." Bleak future. But 9 out of 10 old people around the world do not have a pension. And for many of those lucky 1 in 10 who do, these are worrying times. Sinking portfolio values and demographic changes are forcing cash-strapped governments to consider fundamental reforms. Bismarck designed the system in 1881 and it came into force at the end of that decade in a very different world from the current one. Old people are living longer than they were 50 years ago. Today there are four working Germans paying the pensions of every retired person. But by the time today's youngest workers retire, there will be only two. You don't need to know anything more than that. The system is going to change. So instead of having these whiny articles constantly about how we got to adjust things, instead of us financial planners yelling at people saying, "You've got to save another percentage," we need to find a new way of tackling this problem. The best way I know how to tackle it is with the concept of lifestyle design. Lifestyle design, to the best of my knowledge, was popularized more recently by Tim Ferriss in his book "The 4-Hour Workweek." He designed it, which is a great idea. But I would maintain that all people design their lifestyle. Whether they do it intentionally, knowing the idea of lifestyle design or not, all people still design their lifestyle. Why does one person choose to go to welding school, and why does another person choose to become a horse farrier? One, I would assume, likes horses, and the other, I would assume, likes welders. So that's designing a lifestyle. But the key is that we've got to apply this lifestyle design to every aspect of life. Bill Gates has a lifestyle that I think is really, really neat. Not because of the private jet and the big house. To me, fine. Good for him. To me, the fact that he gets to sit around and read books all day is my... To me, that's an idea. Read books and watch videos and talk to people and solve great problems. In my mind, that's one of the world's greatest things you could do. That would be the most fun thing you can do. That's why I'm creating a podcast. I'm creating a podcast that's about lifestyle design. And any one of us can do it now if we integrate it. So we've got to integrate the lifestyle design and the goal setting and figure out an individualized plan, which will be different for each one of us. One person may say, "I want to work until 65." Another person may say, "I want to quit at 45." Another person may say, "I never want to quit." It doesn't matter what your answer is as long as you know what it is. I think that's enough for today. A longer show today. I plan to come back and continue on this retirement program. We're going to continue with I'm going to read at length from this book, A History of Retirement, because it gives some background that is so crucial to understand the world today. I had to go and learn this from books because I wasn't around. But I've never heard anybody reference this history. Once you reference this history and once you understand that retirement is not this end-all be-all of leisure, that this is a very new concept, it allows you to feel good about making alternate plans. I really believe that the idea of leisure being the goal, we see through that for the most part. We've all been on a vacation that's kind of like we're ready to be off a vacation when we're done with it. That's something that I think we've all experienced. However, there's so much noise in the media. There's so much noise in all of these articles that come across Yahoo Finance, every day, and USA Today, you know, finance section, about how we're supposed to beat ourselves up for not saving for retirement. It's okay to not save for retirement. It's fine. Let me be clear. I save for retirement. But the point is that just saving in a 401k on this arbitrary idea of I've got to save for retirement may not be the best way to do it. The best thing to do sometimes may be to cash out that 401k and go start the business. Warren Buffett did not become rich by saving in an IRA. Conrad Hilton did not become rich by saving in an IRA. We'll finish with this. I just want to point this out. One of my biggest frustrations with the financial media is that a lot of the advice just simply doesn't work. It's lies. It's not lies in the normal way that lie is defined. It's not actually untrue. It's that it just doesn't work. The idea that well, you know, if you'll just save $200 a month into a Roth IRA, you're going to be rich. Is that true? Maybe. There is no mathematical reason why that can't be true. If you will save $200 a month If you will save $200 a month If you will save $200 a month If you will save $200 per month every month, let's say over a 40 year period of time 40 years, and we do this let's just plug in 10% interest and start with nothing Yes, at the end of 40 years you will have $1,264,815 $1,264,815 That is absolutely true. And there's no reason why you can't do more than that. If you save $400 a month at the end of 40 years, you will have $2,500,000. So $400 a month over a 40 year career is $2.5 million which considering what was that statistic that I read 29% of retirees have less than $1,000 and only 11% have more than $250,000 that will put you there. So I was mistaken. So current retirees 17% have $250,000 or more. So yes, $400 a month into a Roth IRA will in fact, under my 10% number, will indeed get you there let's plug in 8% and 8% you're at $1,400,000 So you're in that top top echelon of retirees with money but look at look at the people that are in the Forbes 400. None of them ever got there by saving for retirement and look at the fact that in an IRA, look at the fact that only 17% of retirees have more than a quarter million dollars So what about the rest of them? What's wrong with taking that and starting a business? What's wrong with taking that and investing in other ways? This is not a I love Roth IRAs. I think they're one of the most incredibly flexible accounts but it's not the end all be all It's okay to do other things with the money So we'll talk about that We'll talk about that on another day Hopefully today has been interesting I really appreciate you listening To close out here, just a couple of comments.
