Today is July 1, 2014. And today's show, even though it's Episode 11, today's show is actually going to be the new first episode of the show. So stick with us to find out what is the Radical Personal Finance Podcast and how can we serve you today? Thank you for being with us again. I am thrilled to have you here with us. And I am excited to be back in front of a microphone. Well, excuse me. That's not true. I'm not back in front of a microphone. I'm in front of an actual microphone for the first time. If you go back. And you listen to the first 10 episodes that I recorded of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, you will quickly realize, at least I hope, if everything is working correctly and all this equipment is working correctly, you'll quickly realize that the audio is a little bit better now because I actually have a microphone. For the first 10 shows, which were pretty much kind of a trial run to see if I could do this whole podcast thing, I was using a $10 MP3 recorder held in my hand. And I was trying to lay down a comforter on the table in front of me to kind of minimize the amount of echo in the room to try to make the audio a little bit better. And then with the Skype recordings, I was recording Skype with just the built-in microphone of my laptop on the desk. So I think there's some really great information there. But I think there's some really great information. I hope you go listen. But please make allowance. For the poor audio quality, you have to look past the audio and listen to the content. And this show, I'm sure the audio is not perfect, but I'm excited. And I will improve it in the future. But hopefully, in my opinion, it's a world better. So we'll see if you agree. Today's show, the new Radical Personal Finance Podcast. What is it? Why should you care? Why are we here? So today, we're going to explain all the details of the show. I'm going to explain who I am, what I'm doing, and I hope that you'll follow along for the ride. It's been a year since I recorded those first 10 episodes. The first episode was recorded in July of 2013. I didn't actually intend for it to be a year. I intended it to be, well, I intended to be plugging along in July of 2013, August of 2013, et cetera. But here we are a year later. And today, all will be clear. And as far as the difference between the two, I'm going to talk about the difference between them and the difference between then and now. So first, let me introduce myself to you. In case you don't know, my name is Joshua Sheets. I live here in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which is right next to West Palm Beach, Florida. And I am actually a former financial advisor. And the former financial advisor is the key bit of data that you need to understand the year without shows. Now, those shows weren't really released publicly, but I did share them with a few of you guys in the past. And so that's the reason for the year of no shows. A little bit about my background. Then I'm going to talk about the show and what is going to make this show different. So the design of the Radical Personal Finance podcast is going to be important. And I think my background is going to be important. I won't start with the, well, I was born at such and such a date at such and such a place. Although I was born 29 and some years ago here in West Palm Beach, Florida, in case you care. But the key aspect for the show, obviously, is the connection to finance. So I am a finance, personal finances junkie and have been for a very long time. When I was in high school, all the way back time when I was 13 years old probably, and I should have been out playing football with my friends and getting some exercise, I was sitting in the house reading books on investments and finance because I'd always been fascinated by it and always wanted to be rich, always thought that was just cool, and always thought that money and economics was really interesting. Thankfully, I didn't lose that love of money and economics in the school system, and I just have always enjoyed that. My favorite section in the bookstore, Barnes & Noble, was always the personal finance section. And my favorite section of the library was always the personal finance section of the library. So I was the nerd that was sitting around reading, I don't know, Ben Graham's securities analysis when I should have been out playing. That was over my head. But I did get it because I said, well, good enough for Warren Buffett is good enough for me. And I tried to read it. I never applied enough of it to the book. I never applied it to my life as much as I could have and should have. But I did enjoy that stuff. And so over the years, I read every bit of finance literature that I could get my hands on, would subscribe to personal finance magazines, would listen to personal finance or to finance radio shows, would read every book I could get, subscribe to various newsletters, spent way too much money on personal finance programs, audio programs, and how to get rich plans, and had business ideas and all kinds of things that I was, was pursuing. And all of these things, in my opinion, were really good and really helped shape who I am. After college, probably the important parts for at least this show without going through a whole biography of my life, the important parts of this show were after college, I spent some time working for a corporate company. And I worked in the marketing and brand management consulting business for a company here in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. And really enjoyed it. And I was a big fan of the corporate world. And this was kind of the cushy, my degree in college was in international business. And this was kind of the cushy corporate job that I had always dreamed of. When I started college, I wanted to be a Fortune 500 CEO and work in the corporate world. And this was a good start for me. But I learned over the course of a year or so that I wasn't a big fan of the corporate world and the cubicle and the 9 to 5 and kind of all of that stuff. But I was working at it. And this was, let's see, so this would go back to 2008 that I was at that point. But I knew quickly that it wasn't going to be the long-term fit for me. I knew quickly that it wasn't going to be my career dreams and my career goals. So I was making plans to somewhere around to work at the company I was working at through the end of 2008. And then in 2009 to leave and to go on to something else. And so I was working on kind of what that something else was. But I got surprised in June of 2008. And I got surprised. And I got surprised by being laid off. And at that point I was young and brash. And I'm still pretty young and probably still too brash. But I had the opinion that getting laid off was something that you did if you were bad at your job. And I didn't think I was bad at my job. I thought it was good at my job. I had just gotten a very nice pay raise a couple months earlier. And I had just gotten, I was involved in some projects. And I was getting good feedback. And my performance reviews and all that were good. But the company that I worked with. Made a management decision to adjust their, I guess, employee structure. And they eliminated my job position. Laid me off and everyone else who was in my job position. And was pretty surprised by that. Caught me pretty flat footed. And, you know, I learned something through that. I definitely learned that you don't only get laid off. And I kind of corrected that theory. You don't only get laid off if you're bad at your job. There are lots of reasons for layoffs. Which is a good reason for a plan B. So thankfully I had done a pretty good job with my own financials. And financial planning through circumstances that I'm sure I'll share in the future. But at that time I was completely debt free. I had paid off. I had worked really hard. I had saved money. I had paid off all of my credit cards. Paid off all of my student loans. And I had saved my emergency fund. And again, I always paid attention to the books that I read. I was the nerd who on my 18th birthday. I remember sitting at my parents kitchen table. And I applied for my first two credit cards to start building my credit score. And I opened my Roth IRA. And at that point in time, I think, yeah. It was USAA that I was banking with. And USAA was offering a new program for new, for young adults. That they could waive the minimum amount requirements for a mutual fund. And so I started buying shares of a mutual fund. And I should have done it before that. But whatever. I waited until I was 18. But I just have that distinct memory. So at the time I got laid off, I had done good financial planning. I had my emergency fund. So I was in pretty good shape. I was probably a little bit ungrateful at the, at the interview. I kind of was so, I guess I was nervous and taken aback by the whole thing. And I just said, wow, great. You know, I'm letting me off. Awesome. How big is the severance? And made a really crass joke that I probably shouldn't have. But anyway, it all worked out. So at that point in time, here I was fresh out of college and ready for, to try to figure out what on earth do I want to do? And I had a whole long list of business ideas and different aspects of a business that I thought were, would be, would be neat. And I had different things that I wanted to do, different things that I had thought about doing. But I wasn't exactly sure what the winning idea was going to be. So a couple of weeks after being laid off, I was having lunch with my former boss and he was very kind and was helping me out. And I said, you know, if I can give you any career advice or information about what you'd like to do and, you know, give you, help you out with any connections. Again, just kind of helping, helping me out any way that he could. So I laid out for him kind of what I wanted in a business, you know, what, what I wanted to do. I didn't want to be paid for my time. I wanted to be paid for my results. I didn't want to work for in a corporate world where I had to put in a certain number of hours. I wanted to run my own business. I wanted to build ongoing equity over time instead of just receiving a straight paycheck. And there are a couple of, I wanted to work, be able to work from anywhere. So at the end of my list, he said, you know, it sounds a lot like a career in, you know, financial services, if you ever considered about working in financial services. At that point in time, I was very opinionated, you know, again, brash young man saying, nah. And my opinion was, you know, after all of the reading that I had done, you know, financial advisors are out to, you know, brokers are out to make you a broker. And insurance is a scam and a waste of money. It just makes the insurance agent rich. And, you know, I could do better on my own. I was always a do-it-yourself investor. And I can figure it out on my own. And so he said, listen, you know, that may be true, but you ought to at least consider it. His son had actually interned in the financial services business and had had a good experience. And so he said, I'm a client, he was a client actually at that time of a company called Northwestern Mutual, which is an old traditionally life insurance company out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And he said, go look at Northwestern Mutual. And he was a client of theirs. And so he gave me a referral to his financial advisor. And his financial advisor was a person who his son had actually interned with in years past. So I went and said, fine. You know, I didn't expect anything to come of it. But went and interviewed with the financial advisor. And probably one of the more difficult interviews that the recruiting interviews that the, excuse me, recruiting interviews that the advisor had ever conducted. But, you know, I had tons of questions and very strongly and sure about my opinions and beliefs. And, but I liked him. And I liked the aspect. I liked the financial planning atmosphere that he created. And I just really liked it. And so it kind of opened my eyes. And I said, you know, I wonder if I could achieve my goals in working in the financial services business. So I started interviewing. Started researching. Interviewed at a couple different companies. Researched various compensation programs. Looked at the wire houses. Looked at local small advisors. Looked at, you know, insurance companies. Kind of crossed the basis. And kind of laid out my goals as far as what I wanted in a financial planning practice. After all of that, I wound up back at Northwestern Mutual. And opened a practice there. And this would have been 2008. About fall of 2008. And started my practice. And I started. And I started primarily working with insurance products. That's the simplest way to get started in financial services. And I'll explain. At some point in time, I'll share some thoughts that I have. As far as different models for succeeding as a financial services professional. For anybody else that's interested. And I hope that it will help people who are researching the business. I would have liked to have had more information at that time when I was researching the business. I'll share the thoughts and the ideas that I have. On that at some point in the future. But for now, I started with insurance. Life insurance. Disability income insurance. Long-term care insurance. And health insurance. And then as I was able to get my licenses squared away. And grow in ability. I started working with the investment business. And became primarily really built into having a goal with being an investment advisor. And I enjoyed the technical aspects of financial planning. So I tried to focus my practice on working a lot with business owners and with retirees. Because I enjoyed all of the complex technical aspects of financial planning. That those types of clients can present. And over the years as I've watched it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot about financial planning. And I learned a lot that there are many aspects to the advice that's needed. And there's good technical advice that's needed. And then there's good behavioral advice that's needed. And many times one of the problems that financial advisors. And the clients face is that sometimes they're looking for a technical solution. When in reality what's needed is not a technical solution. But a what's the term for it? Maybe an imaginative solution. Or a psychological solution. You know I always compare financial planning to dieting. Dieters don't fail for lack of adequate diet plan. And people don't fail at their finances for lack of an adequate you know financial suggestions. They fail for other reasons that go beyond whether or not the diet works. Or whether the financial planner works. And I've always been a consumer of financial media. Always have enjoyed financial blogs. Always have enjoyed financial radio shows and books. And always enjoyed reading as many personal finance books as possible. And I just over the years I've noticed a disconnect. And there's a disconnect between the personal finance side. And then the professional finance side. And I don't you know I never understood why there should be a disconnect. But the experiences that I had was that a lot of times many of the personal finance pundits were not coming from the professional side of having worked with clients. And many of the professional side you know just had this air of superiority in some ways. That is almost like the technical solution is going to solve everything. And I've seen them both as incredibly important. So I thought well with my background why don't I start a show. And I thought I tried writing. I've been writing various articles and things. But writing has always come it's been difficult for me. And I can talk for a long time as you'll find out. Hopefully it's interesting talk. But I can talk much more easily than writing. So I said I'll create a podcast. So I started creating a podcast. And I recorded the 10 episodes which I'm now releasing publicly. Recorded those 10 episodes with a goal of kind of using it as a test bed. To be able to release. And really enjoyed it. And was not able to publish them. And market them extensively because I was in the business. But using it as kind of a test platform. So then I went started working through the ropes of getting them approved by my company and all of that. And basically long story short we weren't able wasn't able to get it done. The problem one of the reasons. And you may not be aware of it. But one of the reasons why you won't hear many professional financial advisors publicly in the media. Is that any time a financial advisor makes a public appearance. And there are exceptions to this. But generally the general rule is that if you see an article written by someone who is a practicing advisor. That this person has a team of attorneys that have probably read through it to make sure that it's okay. And different companies will allow different things. But it ranges from companies. And especially if you work at a broker dealer. You have a lot of challenges because the laws are fairly stringent. And there's a lot of liability for the broker dealer. And so and rightly so the broker dealer generally is slow to approve outward facing media content. And this is right. You know if I were running a broker dealer I would you know you have a responsibility to your to your owners. Whether it's your stockholders or your shareholders or whoever owns the company. You have a responsibility and that is. That is right. And that is proper. But it's challenging for the individual advisor. So I always just had these frustrations. But I see the good that the financial blogger world or the financial pundit world brings. And I also see the good of where the financial advisor world brings in. And that I think that they should be working together. And I really want to bridge that gap. Because it's a win win win. The best educated customer. Excuse me. My best clients. When I was a financial advisor were always the clients that had the most financial knowledge and the most financial that were the most financially literate. That was who I felt was was my best client. And it was a lot easier to work with someone who was extremely financially literate than to work with somebody who didn't have a high degree of financial literacy. And so you know I want to create I want to help bridge that gap. So my show you know my purse a little bit of my philosophy. But as I've watched for the last six years of working as a professional advisor and still consuming financial media I have learned from a lot of my mistakes years ago and I hope I continue to learn from my mistakes. But one of the things that I have learned is that there is actually very little that is right or wrong in financial planning. And what's right or wrong has much more to do with an individual situation with one's perspective than some kind of existential eternal perfect financial. And so I think that's the real reason why I'm here today. And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today. And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.

And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today. And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today. And you've got another interest rate of 20% of non-deductible interest on a secured asset. And I'm making these dramatic examples to prove my point, kind of creating a straw man argument here. And I'm aware of that. But don't tell me that doesn't matter. That matters. So when you get in the real world, you need to understand this background and integrate the two. And look at it in an actual situation. Do you have somebody who is very highly motivated independently of the interest rates? Or do you have somebody who has kind of bumbled their way through life and never paid attention to their debts? And now they want to pay their debt. And now they want to pay their debt.
