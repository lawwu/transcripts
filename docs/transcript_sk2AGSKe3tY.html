And you are the, like, decademy of being Ryan Garcia, unapologetically Ryan Garcia. Yeah. What are some of the things that you feel like you stand for that publicly you get backlash from that you continue to, like, stand ten toes on?</p><p>Well, one, obviously my faith, you know. You could feel the pressure when you start talking about God with people that, you know, you just know. You could feel, like, a tension in the air. But also, like, I was standing up for, you know, children's sex trafficking. I mean, I've always been a big advocate on just, like, stopping it and, you know, really caring for those kids because it happens all across the world and not a lot of people talk about it.</p><p>So that's another thing. Facts. That's just, like, for me, it really breaks my heart. You know, I have three children. So for me, that was a big thing that I wanted to, you know, talk about. And then just, like, being against cancel culture, like, you know, the people that are not with that, you know, I don't really like that.</p><p>You know, it's like a mob type of thing and you affect free speech. And, yes, there's times where people, you know, shouldn't say some sort of shit, but they should be called out for it. But then they shouldn't be, yeah, it shouldn't be a culture of, hey, you can't say nothing about this.</p><p>You can't disagree with someone. And if you disagree from the public, now you're completely canceled. Exactly. I have been super outspoken about that, too. And, man, the child sex trafficking thing is crazy you mentioned that because this past summer I went to the Philippines on a missions trip. I never went on, like, a missions trip before.</p><p>I went with a church group. We went out to the Philippines because that's, like, a real red zone for children getting trafficked. They have so much poverty out there that, man, it's own parents of children that are trafficking their own kids. They're putting them on web Zoom calls and making the children do things to each other for some guy in America who's paying to watch this wild stuff.</p><p>And it's sickening. And that's, like, a passion of mine, too, because, like, that is one of the most under-talked about crimes. Like, there's 800,000 or some crazy stat of children that go missing a year. Yeah. Where are they really going? Right. And there's so much, like, pedophilia. And it's a billion-dollar industry.</p><p>There's so much pedophilia that... Who's spending that money, bro? Who's spending that money? Who is the one keeping this under wraps? Like, it's such an under-talked-about thing, and that's for a reason. So, like, the fact that you speak on that, the fact that I'm willing to go support that, like, there needs to be more people that are willing.</p><p>And people, like, you know... It's a hard conversation, which I get it. It's a hard conversation. I get it. Like, it makes people... But it's reality. It's reality. It's really happening, and it's really happening to real kids, happening to real families. Like, man, if you, like, I got to go play with these little kids that had gotten rescued out of being trafficked, you know?</p><p>Yeah. I got to, like, see their... And these kids are traumatized and damaged for life, but to just put smiles on their faces. And so, who cares, like, about the sensitivity that grown adults are having when this conversation is brought up? Because it's really happening to real kids. The only way to help it is to talk about it, you know?</p><p>The day. So, you know, we could all get up on all these other things and try to support, you know, other movements. But this is, like, one of the hardest things that, I mean, I've had to listen to and just listen to the stories. And, you know, for me, it's like we should all, together as a society, like, come and try to help, you know what I mean?</p><p>Like, it's still happening, you know? It's still going on in the world. And, you know, us as, you know, people in general, just people, we should go in and help. I remember you got, like, called crazy on the internet or something because you were going on lives or something and speaking on some of your own experiences, some things that, and people were saying, oh, he's just on drugs.</p><p>Oh, he's chirping, da-da-da-da-da. I've never done drugs in my life. And everything you were saying, like, I know that stuff is true. And so the people, like... Well, it's right in front of the faces. Like, if you just do a simple search, you could see that it's real. You could see all that stuff.</p><p>What was some of the, you know, the Twitter rants or some of the stuff that you were talking about in terms of this? And, like, is that stuff that now, because of backlash, you are, like, hesitant to talk on? Or do you stand on some of that stuff? I mean, I'm always going to stand on stuff, you know?</p><p>Like, I'm not, like, a super big conspiracy theorist, but, you know, I do know a bunch. And some are real. And some are real, you know what I mean? At the end of the day, like, people really didn't know about the Bohemian Grove, but that's actually been around for a minute.</p><p>Like, it's a real thing. Like, real politicians got together into the woods, which sounds crazy, and did, like, weird rituals. I don't think it's that far-fetched, because once people get money, and then they get fame, the only next thing is power. And some of this stuff that people are into when you get up there, it's really about power.</p><p>It's about control. Like, y'all call me crazy. That's crazy. Like, bro, I don't care how big I get. I ain't going to no woods and celebrating no owl, and it's burning. Do you feel like... But that's a real thing. I know when people hear it, it's like, they think I'm lying, but no, it's a proven thing.</p><p>It's a good to be real. Yeah, no, I think that... Do you feel like, though, when you speak on that, even though it's truth, I respect that you're fearless, because there's people that would be so hesitant to talk about that, that know it's true, or know that some of these conspiracies really happen, because they're scared they might get canceled, or they might die, or they might be labeled as a lunatic and be blackmailed.</p><p>Which, when you start talking about this stuff, you usually get labeled as crazy, lunatic, weirdo. But at the end of the day, like, you can look at me, I'm chill as hell. Yeah, like, I'm not. So, like, I really wasn't fearing that, and I just felt like it was my mission to start speaking the truth of shit.</p><p>And honestly, some of the stuff, like, oh, yeah, like, he was talking about, you know, the LGBTQ community and all that. You know, I was talking about when they do the parade, show their junk to kids, that's not okay. You know what I mean? Like, you do you, but at the end of the day, that's wrong.</p><p>You know what I mean? And then when... What did you get backlash for that for? Because how I worded it. Really? Yeah. If you don't say the exact terminology the exact perfect way, then they're going to get very offended. Yeah, so that was that. But also, it was like, they mocked Jesus Christ at the Olympics.</p><p>Like, I'm going to push back a little bit, just like, you know? But then again, I'm not going to be mean to people. Like, if you're gay, you're gay. I don't care. You do you. But there's certain things that, like, everybody needs to be held accountable in any type of, you know, what's it called?</p><p>Community. Yeah. Like, I don't care what community you're part of. Like, if you're doing wrong, you're doing wrong. You know what I mean? Like, nobody should have favoritism just because they're, like, oh, they're a community that gets, you know... Bullied, so now they can do whatever... They almost become the bully because nobody could call them out without getting canceled.</p><p>Yeah, I understand. Which I don't believe in canceling. It's stupid. I understand exactly. You know what I mean? It's like, damn, you can't call them out because of what? When they were... If they were... If that community was doing something messed up... If my brother was killing somebody, I'm going to tell him, bro, watch the fuck out with you.</p><p>Like, you know what I mean? I'm going to call out my brother. It's the same thing. You know what I mean? Like, just because, you know, it's taboo to call him out. It's like, nah, bro. Like, everybody should be called out. I don't care who you are. I understand that.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? It's a fact. Yeah. Well, man, like... That's always been my heart. It's like, nobody should have power just because they've been attacked before. No, it's like, no, if they're doing wrong, they're doing wrong. They're doing right, they're doing right. Cool. And that's so, that's so like...</p><p>It's very simple. It's so true and simple that people will still try to miscommunicate and people will still try to... You don't get what we've been through. You don't get that the LGBTQ community's been going through. Like, bro, I don't... I already can hear the comments. But at the end of the day, like...</p><p>Like, truth is truth. Right is right. Wrong is wrong. In the day and age we live in, that's getting so twisted. It's getting so twisted. And it says in the Bible, man... Such a fine line. It says in the Bible, like in the end times, like, right will become wrong, wrong will become right.</p><p>And I feel like it's becoming slowly, it's getting there where like, you can't really tell anymore what people are going to view as right or wrong. Or if you're speaking truth and you're speaking facts and you're being a hunter and whatever, people will still find the wrong in that.</p><p>Society's getting so weird, bro. It's like everybody's so sensitive. Like, that's my whole thing. It's like, damn, bro, what are we becoming? Why you can't just tell your truth? Or even if it's not the truth, why can't you state your opinion on something without getting canceled? Nowadays, you can't even speak your opinion without getting canceled if it goes against the mass.</p><p>Even saying, like, that is like, oh, like, what is he talking about? Like, it's just so crazy nowadays. I know, bro. It's so weird, bro. Like, I can't believe it. I'm like, what is... I feel like I'm in a Black Mirror episode. I'm in a house that look like a Black Mirror episode.</p><p>I'm scared. You know what? I did a podcast right before yours. The guest said, man, it's kind of cool once you get canceled because once you get canceled, you're free. Now you actually get to speak on things that you get to speak on. And obviously, like, you should be...</p><p>We should be careful as, you know, Christ followers that we don't want to go out of our way to offend people or hurt people or whatever. But at the end of the day, like, when you speak truth nowadays, a lot of times it's going to offend people. So I think it's kind of cool that, you know, they may take something you say on the Internet and label you crazy.</p><p>They may... You know, this past week has been a little rough for me because I might speak my opinion on something. People may disagree with it. But it's kind of cool that once you are labeled as that, you kind of are free. You kind of escape the matrix a little bit.</p><p>And you break from that chain of fear, you know what I mean? That's really what's bound to you, fear. Fear. Because we are basically saying what people are already thinking. Exactly. And at the end of the day, when you do that, you could see the community of truth seekers coming back you up.</p><p>They're coming back you up. And I think now they're starting to be more and more. Like, they're starting to become a very clear-cut line of people that are sheep versus not sheep. People that think for themselves. People that are trying to whatever, wake up. And people that are just stuck in their programming.</p><p>100%. I feel like there's not a lot of people with the platform you have, with the platform that, you know, I have that are actually able to overcome that fear of not worrying about what the masses say. I mean, the only thing we got to worry about is the other side.</p><p>They have bots, bro. Like, I know it's crazy, but they have little bots that we're going to go in your comments. They're not real people. Yeah, and they're going to try to push the narrative that they want to push. 100%. And then normal people will look at those and see that, oh, this is what everybody's thinking about this.</p><p>Let me hop on and agree with them. Yes. So, I already peep all that. Y'all not slick. Yeah, they definitely do that. It's a whole thing, but, like, that's, like, true, though. Like, that's, like, they could have smear campaigns with bots. Like, that's a real thing. And that's why I feel like, man, like, when we talk, you know about the Bible, you read the Bible, you know about...</p><p>When you talk about end times and you talk about the coming of, like, some of these end times things, this is the perfect day and age for some of this to happen. Because whoever this Antichrist person is, he needs to be able to create narratives. I understand. And you need social media to do that.</p><p>So, the fact that now you have AI, you got social media, you got these bots that are willing to create whole narratives. Brainwash people, basically. Brainwash people. I feel like, man, like, when you talk, and that's why I feel like that it's so important that people that are willing to speak about these subjects do, because we're just having a conversation.</p><p>We don't know when some of this stuff will happen, but the fact that we're actually willing to speak about it. There will be signs, and, you know, I've had a lot of supernatural spiritual experiences where, you know, I cannot deny Christ. And that's just, you know, something that I feel like I've always been called to do, and spread that message.</p><p>And, you know, I do feel like, you know, like you said, we never know, but it definitely feels intense. I say that. Especially trying to speak truth. Yeah. Like, it's never been more intense to do that, you know. And it's never been, you know, there's never been this much fear.</p><p>I'd say that. There's never been this much fear. There's never been this much. We live in a very peculiar time, Bob.</p></div></div></body></html>
