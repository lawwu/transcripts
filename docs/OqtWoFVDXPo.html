Jesus spoke this way a lot. In Matthew 4, 19,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">he said to his disciples, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus's command to follow seems significant in all four Gospels. In Matthew 8, 22,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, "Follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead." In Mark 10, 21,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, "You lack one thing. Go, sell all that you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">come follow me." In Luke 9, 23, he says, "If anyone would come after me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">follow me." And in John 10, 27, he says, "My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Ketex, all of them.

Basically, Paul avoids the language of following Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Why?

So here's a few observations. Number one, in John 13 36,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, where are you going?"

And Peter said, "Lord,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">why cannot I follow you now? I lay down my life for you." And Jesus, in essence, said, "No, you can't, and you won't."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So what did Jesus mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">when he said, "You cannot follow me now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but you will afterwards"?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, he meant, first of all, that I'm about to die on the cross, and you're not ready to follow me there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to deny me tonight, or, you know, three times.

As if to say, "Later,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqtWoFVDXPo&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll have the courage to die with me."
