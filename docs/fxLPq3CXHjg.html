But I want to just start off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">asking what you think the biggest misconception people have about travel is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think the obvious answer, at least to me, is that people think it's expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think less so now because so much is on social media and there's so many blogs and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's talked about. But I still think the vast majority of people will say, well, they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">really have time to travel. But if you did, there's always time. But then they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, I just can't afford it." Because people think, "Oh, plane tickets are expensive. Hotels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">are being beat." They see all these commercials and this glamorized version of travel on social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">media. And they just think, "Well, that's pricing. Travel is a luxury item. It's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a must-have thing. It's something you do to relax, to take a break."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's this perception that this is expensive, when it doesn't have to be because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you always can go over to wherever you're going and just do the local things and the local things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cost a non-touristy price. And so I think if you ask people, "Well, how much do you spend in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">own life?" People have these very way off estimates. They usually have a low... They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on the lower end. But if you get people to record all their expenses, even like, "Oh, I bought a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">water bottle. That's a couple bucks." But you don't think about it. People actually spend a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">more than they think they do. And then when you balance that versus the price of travel, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">oftentimes cheaper. I live in the Bay Area. So anywhere in the world I would go has to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">probably cheaper except maybe Tokyo or a few cities. So life other places is cheaper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I experienced this actually... It was probably almost 15 years ago. We traveled for 8 months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and we rented our place out at home.

And by industry, I mean writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and sharing your travels online. You wrote a memoir about what you've learned after being a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">nomad for a decade.

So I'm 42 this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so obviously, my days of cheap meals and 12-bed hostel dorms is long gone. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like nice food. Since I work when I travel, having a place to work is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of good sleep is important. So I tend to get my own room, hotels. I take a lot more paid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">walking tours or food tours. And so for me, the biggest thing is that my accommodation is a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">nicer. I take more paid activities. Whereas when I was 25, it was all about the free stuff, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hostel dorms, cooking your own meals. I still consider myself a backpacker budget traveler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I take public transportation. I love street food. I still do parks and local things and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">go to the markets and all that jazz. I'm not a resort guy. I don't really do luxury. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's nice, but it feels very isolating to me. So that's the biggest thing that for me has changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably been nicer days.

I think travel has become a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">more accessible than when I started traveling.

How do I do this thing? And so I was still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">primarily using guidebooks as well as just asking around. But between social media and the advent of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so many blogs, there's nothing you can't learn with a quick Google search. There's no hidden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">restaurant, this hidden town. There are places that are more well-known than anywhere else,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's no place that's unknown in the age of the internet.

Even if you're so scared because you're going to a place you've never been,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's no longer like this fog out there.

Sometimes one of the ways that I get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">inspiration is I'll just search on YouTube and it's, "Okay.

It was more of a directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Guidebooks, even in the best of times, are usually a year and a half behind what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I never have used guidebooks as a price guide.

But I'm curious, you said now that you've gotten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">older, have done this a while, your digs have gone up. You wrote the book. People have referenced it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in many ways about being the guide for backpacking about traveling the world on $50 a day. Do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think that still holds both in today's world, inflation, pandemic, and as people age and want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to experience travel, not in a hostel with 12 beds? Yes and no. That book is never about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">number. A lot of people would get caught up on that like, "Oh, $50. Good luck doing your way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on $50." I mean, you're traveling the world on $50 a day. So it's a daily average. Some places,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">totally. Especially post-COVID, strong dollar. India is still very cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Parts of Central America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, still very cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But your average place for a hostel in Western Europe is probably 30 euros an hour a night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's very rare to see dorm beds, 10 euros, 15 euros. They're still out there, but they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">harder to find. And they're less common. And the beds are probably going to be like 20 beds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I, and I am going to redo this book, probably for a post-COVID, post-inflation world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd probably up it to like a $65, $70 a day average. If you're doing the quintessential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">round the world trip, going to Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">South and Central America. And if you're coming from the US, that's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">even better because the US dollar is so strong right now. Will that stay? Who knows?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">When I planned my original trip around the world, I remember it was one US dollar got you $1.30</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Australian. So that's what my budget was based off of. And by the time I got there is one-to-one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I lost 30% of my budget because of that. So I had to readjust everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's less about the number and more about the style, the tips, the tricks. If you're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">looking for ways to travel cheap, forget about the number. Just use the strategies in the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So let's talk about some of those strategies. Because I liked how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually broke it down. It wasn't just, "There are a bunch of strategies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Go have a great trip." It's, "Here's what you specifically need to know."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So how would you walk someone through the high level of planning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a trip like this with a goal to do it on a budget? What are the best? What are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">key strategies that people need to follow? I think the biggest thing for people is one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">travel slow. The more you can spread out your costs, the better it will be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're moving around a lot, you're going to have high transportation costs. And that really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">can eat into a lot of people's budgets. But the big thing is just really being flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you can wait for that deal to come, then you're not tied into, "I have to get this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">flight on this day to this destination." And so one of the benefits of long-term travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is that you're in no rush to do anything. You can wait for that flight deal, that hotel deal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or you can find a flight deal or a hotel deal and be like, "That's where we're going next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's where it's cheapest." And so big picture, always be flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Second big picture thing is to travel like you live. You in your daily life cook food,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't eat expensive food all the time, restaurants.

Yeah. I think that people get too caught up in point value. For most people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just get a card, book your flight, that works, and don't spend time doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">People overcomplicate the simple.

People are like, "Oh, well, this is worth 1 cent. So you want to move it here on 2</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">days?" Yeah, you could really go deep. But for most people, they're taking one trip a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">2 trips a year.

That it costs $100,000 points in $5 or 70,000 points in $500. I'd rather spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">more points than more money. So when people are like, "Oh, I got this great deal. It's only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">60,000 points plus $400." It's like, "Well, yeah." For this business class flight, it's like, "Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2699" target="_blank">00:44:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but you're paying a lot in those fees." To me, that's not worth it. But some people are like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, I did the math out."

It's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the guy from The Hangover.

Sri Lanka,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Nepal, also just great places, but not a lot of tourists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically getting a really unfiltered view of places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's something I'm looking for now as we evolve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But one thing that's changed for me, and I'd love your perspective. We did a lot of travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">solo, did a lot of travel with my wife, backpacking, and now we have kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I know you said you're now in your 40s. How do you think travel for people who are now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have a more demanding career, aren't able to work entirely on the road, have kids, have families,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you think that affects the style of travel you've spent years writing about and living?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And what do you think that looks like for the years ahead for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think budget travel is a state of mind more than a style. Like, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we have to stay in hostels or whatever." So for me, as long as I'm still doing the local thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to me, that's just budget travel.

I don't want to eat at a resort. So I don't really see a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of change happening in my life.

I think one thing that I'm going to change is just... And you already highlighted this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but just having less things to do.

We just had a great conversation with Derek Sivers, who talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">how he traveled with his son.

This is really reminiscent because I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">did an eight-month trip where it was just like this. And my wife and I did a lot of this before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">kids. It's just recognizing that you're not going to... A lot of what you're going to experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like your example in Italy, is being in another place, understanding another culture, food,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">language. And that doesn't require seeing every museum in the town. It doesn't require ticking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">off every five-star restaurant. It can be a lot different. And it can be a lot more rewarding to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do that. And even more so if you get outside of the cities. Sometimes just where you stay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe don't stay in the most central part of town to force yourself to be around locals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLPq3CXHjg&t=3199" target="_blank">00:53:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I agree.
