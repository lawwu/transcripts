The Bible is filled with statements, not just of facts, but also statements about the worth and the beauty and the desirability of those facts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't just say God is powerful, but that God is glorious and great in glory and beautiful, that he's infinitely, transcendently valuable, that Jesus not only exists, but that he has all these attributes that make him more precious than the greatest pearl and more valuable than the greatest treasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Paul himself, remember, said that he found more satisfaction in knowing Christ than he did in all other reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what would it mean to say you believed that, but did not embrace him as beautiful or valuable or supremely pleasant?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think most people would say, "You don't mean it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You say you believe he is infinitely valuable.

All these value statements are really true."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The mind is going to wind up saying, "No, this is probably mythological," or, "It's probably got errors in it," or, "The text was corrupted," or, "There are contradictions everywhere."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what the mind is going to do in order to protect the heart's treasure in man rather than in God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's my main reason for saying no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't believe the Bible is 100% true and still be lost if what I'm saying is on track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you really believe that Jesus is the supreme value and beauty and truth in the universe, you're going to embrace Him because that's what it means to believe Him as supremely beautiful and satisfying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe the last thing I should ask is, what about those folks in Matthew 7 where it says, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven, on that day many will say to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpjFxrSqow&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name?'
