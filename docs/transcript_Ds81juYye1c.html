And that typically looks a little bit better than a statement credit, but it doesn't necessarily perform better. And what I mean by that is a lot of times card issuers or some card issuers, at least, will offer opportunities to get like, let's say, 25% more for your points when you redeem points for travel through their travel portal.</p><p>And that looks and sounds good, but there's some opportunity cost involved there where you're not necessarily getting the 25% more that you think you are. So I don't necessarily love booking travel through the credit card portal. Although there are times when it makes sense. And I think it makes more sense for flights in general than for hotels.</p><p>Uh, and sometimes if you're booking a boutique hotel where you wouldn't have access to a better price, otherwise, there are times when that can make sense. But generally speaking, I find the opportunities to get outsized value to be in transferring your points to the various credit card transfer programs.</p></div></div></body></html>
