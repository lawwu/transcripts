Yeah. I think that the deep pain point relates to sort of the envy of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">often husbands, fathers who have a setup that is more conducive to longer stretches of work time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What's ironic though, I think is that part of why it's hard as a mom, and I'm saying this with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of stereotypes in hand, and I recognize that and I apologize, is that part of what makes it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hard to have those long stretches is the guilt that interrupts. I could put my children in much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">more childcare and my husband would be fine with it, but I feel really uncomfortable about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I certainly felt desperately uncomfortable about it when my children were infants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that wasn't something he struggled with. Now, whether that's socially driven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">by the lessons that were taught as young women and young men, as we age, or whether it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">biological, I think is a really complicated question to answer. I think there's evidence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on both sides, but the fact of the matter is moms tend to feel more guilty about time away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from their kids than dads do just on average. This isn't always the case. So I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the tricky points. And so when you use the word deep work, people automatically think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's many hours, although you define it in a much more nuanced way that you can do deep work in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">shorter chunks of time. And that's really what I advocate in my book is figuring out how to more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">mindfully drop into work, how to use some of the behavioral science that we know is really helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for getting into the mode of deep work more quickly and efficiently. And also recognizing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">while task switching or role switching does cost us something in terms of the energy that it takes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the more we do it, the more we practice doing that role switching, the more facile we get at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But also, it's a both and. Also, we don't want to do it too much because then we really do end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with what Bridget Schulte calls confetti time, time confetti, I think it's the term. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">complicated. It is emotional. And it can feel like an injustice. Like, why do I feel so guilty when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you can sort of be free to go to work? And I think that is the part that I'll at least just speak for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">myself that I used to get very, very hung up on. So. - That's really useful, actually. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I really appreciate that. I mean, just to echo it back, but I think I understand what you're saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is, no, it's not about the physical act of deep work, which is just, oh, I have an hour to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why don't I focus on one thing for the first 45 and then do the small things at the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of interleaving it? Like, yeah, anyone in whatever their situation is can change their ratio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of deep to shallow work. But it's the reality, which I point out. So fair enough. Like, I make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this point in my book that the more deep work you can do tends to be correlative to career success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So more deep work is better than less. Men have an easier time doing more deep work than women</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual ability to do the work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That is very frustrating. I mean, if someone said, okay, here's the thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">people from most states get to work their jobs normally, but people from Maryland have to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever, call in to the department of whatever every hour or so. And there's all these other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">things that they put on citizens of Maryland. It's like taking up our time. I would be really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">frustrated. Like, look at all these people in Virginia. They're getting more done. They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">not as interrupted. It's not fair just because I live in Maryland. So if I'm echoing that back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right, that actually is very helpful. And I could imagine that being, I can empathize. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I can kind of understand as best I can in my position. That kind of sucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">- I think it does. The other thing to think about is, what do we reward in our society? And what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we do reward tends to be accolades and more lines on your CV and more money. And one of the things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the gifts I think of working parenthood, and this is particularly true for mothers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because they tend on average to be more involved in the parenting role, is that we tend on average</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to be stronger in the relational department, in the empathy department, in the perspective-taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">department, in the patients department. And those skills are really useful at work. They just tend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not to be rewarded or acknowledged as being as important. And so I think that is another piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6r-HJAweZw&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that can get under people's skin.
