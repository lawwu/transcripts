So the first question is in regards to the Bogle Center. So what are the goals of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Bogle Center for Financial Literacy? And what can we expect to see going forward from that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">organization? Well, the pandemic, obviously, changed things a whole lot with conferences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and the like. But we've been spending a lot of time on mission, vision, values, goals, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we want to do is, first of all, more support to the chapters. And I think Gail is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">doing an amazing job spending an amazing amount of time on this. The conference, we want to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">back into having in-person conferences again. It's not going to happen this year, but it will happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">next year. And we are going to do more virtual conferences, the speaker series, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We would-- kind of a lofty goal, but we want to develop some tools to help people in different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">modes of decision relating to the life cycle, spending, saving, spending, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, just so we can get the word out more, more media exposure. So those are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of the high-level lofty goals that we would like to do more of. Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Bartz has the next questions. Thank you again, Alan, for joining us tonight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">John Bogle principles brought us together this evening, so we appreciate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So our question is, what do you consider the basic principles of Boglehead investing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first of all, I mean, John Bogle changed my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't realize how common this was, but I sent him a letter once saying, I'd love to meet you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And a week later, got a letter back. I'm coming to Colorado in a few weeks. Let's get together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So he has just been an amazing man and mentor. Meeting him was kind of like meeting my favorite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">rock star president, et cetera. But if I had to say what he taught me about investing-- and these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are my words. Investing in eight words are minimizing expenses and emotions, maximizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">diversification and discipline. It's that simple. When people violate that, they usually do so with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">their own peril. So it really is that simple. And it was very easy, by the way, when my son was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">eight, because money didn't mean anything to him. The older we get, the more money means to us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and the harder it is to behave right. But Jack Bogle, I consider him a multibillion-dollar man</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in how much he saved people, not just at Vanguard, but at other firms that had to copy Vanguard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to stay competitive. OK, thank you. In some of your writing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we've noticed that you've been highly critical of investment advertisers. Can you tell us a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bit about that, your critical stance on investment advertising in general?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we were kind of joking before this started. I was going to sell an annuity at the end where we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">will give out the chicken dinners and the like. But the more one spends on advertising,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the higher the fees they have to charge. And if you think about it, advertising is all about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">emotions, is all about wanting to get a better value than just the market, et cetera. So for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">most part, advertising-- I'm very critical of the CFP board, and I am a CFP. The amount of advertising</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they're doing versus-- it's the opposite strategy of Jack Bogle. Jack Bogle wanted to do the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, and people would come. A lot of other firms and the CFP board, in my opinion, are doing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">advertising and saying, hey, once we get more people and more money, then we'll lower fees and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">do things differently. And that's kind of like the 12v1 fee model that failed miserably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I mean, investing should be boring. It really should. And that would make a really lousy ad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Great. And Royce has our next questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi, Alan. So my first question's a multi-part one. So before we officially started the meeting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Miriam had mentioned in your books how you described the second grader portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you describe what that portfolio is and how someone goes about getting a proper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">stock bond allocation? And then also, is that different in different life stages? For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you had mentioned your son's ad allocation. Has that changed since you wrote the book?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure. Well, I mean, the basic-- you know, Taylor? Taylor, great minds think alike.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So the basic second grader portfolio is Taylor's three-fund portfolio, is a total US and a total</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">international stock index fund. With just those two, you own over 10,000 companies across the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">planet. And then a total bond index fund, where you own all investment-grade, taxable, fixed-rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">US bonds. So it's pretty much that simple. When my son was eight, we had him at 90%. He's gotten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit more conservative now. He's 23, living out on his own in Madison, Wisconsin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's starting to think about maybe someday buying a house and such. So he wants to take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">little risk off the table. I'm not a believer in setting asset allocation. There's a couple of--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">100 minus your age, I don't believe in that. There's a risk profile questionnaire. And Jason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Zweig, who's one of the three people I blame the most for getting me into writing, he and I have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">disagreement. He says those risk profile questionnaires are worthless. And I say, Jason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you're wrong. They're not that good. They're actually dangerous. If you think about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">March 19th of last year, when stocks hit an all-time high, we thought we could take a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of risk.

But the biggest factor is our need to take risk, as Bill Bernstein puts it so eloquently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">when you've won the game, quit playing.

So it's not that simple, setting the asset allocation. But consistency, consistency,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">consistency.

Depending upon your tax situation, that debt may or may not be tax deductible. But I consider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2502" target="_blank">00:41:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all debt the inverse of a bond.

So depending on how expensive the debt is, whether or not they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2532" target="_blank">00:42:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">getting a tax deduction, and whether or not they've contributed enough to their 401(k)</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to get the employer match. My next question is, is there any real value,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or should a young investor seriously consider tilting their portfolio to value funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and in particular, small cap value, since they do have a longer investing lifetime ahead of them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">In my opinion, no. Some people experimented with drugs when they were younger. I experimented with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">DFA.

So on one hand, I don't believe in ignoring small cap. I don't believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in ignoring value. But I also don't believe in overweighting it. And if you think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the second grader math, or as Jack Bogle would say, the humble rules of arithmetic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that was his phrase. If one part of the market does better, another part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the market has to underperform. And lately, it has been small cap value, until just recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't know how far that's going to continue.

You want to earn some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iCckgBDwk&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have a return.

It's not always going to outperform.
