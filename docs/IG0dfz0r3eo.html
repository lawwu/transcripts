This was a terrible off, this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a terrible area, but he made it hip and cool.

Again, this is quarterly, they're up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">now an all time high 247 million subscribers, and the annual growth rate all the way back to 2001</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3719" target="_blank">01:01:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">still pretty spectacular. And their revenue also very respectable for Netflix. However, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">overspent massively during the peak streaming era 2019 to 2022. And that's when subscriber growth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3733" target="_blank">01:02:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">started to slow.

So here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the major problem.

Let's take stars as an example, it turns 12% of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3808" target="_blank">01:03:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">users every month, which means that over a year, they've turned 144% of their user base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That means that they have to basically turn their entire membership base one and a half times in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">order just to tread water. Right. So if you start with 100, it's a lot of money that you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3827" target="_blank">01:03:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">spend to make sure you end the year at 100. Forget about growing. If you look at peacock,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to lose 100% of their subscribers in a year. If you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3837" target="_blank">01:03:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">discovery, they're going to lose 75%. If you look at max, they're going to lose 50 odd percent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3846" target="_blank">01:04:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple TV, same Hulu and Disney plus will lose 60%.

So I guess that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3867" target="_blank">01:04:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a positive indication.
