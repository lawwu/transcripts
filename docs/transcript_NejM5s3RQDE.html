I've never been to a comedy show.</p><p>Comedy shows are hilarious, bro. I've been to a few. I've been to a hard time. Yeah, I had the gym. Just opened up again. Reza, he loaded me up with two plates. Then I went home. Baby, she made me a meal. She loaded me up with two plates. Just bought a whip.</p><p>Registered that in GA. I had to go get me new plates. I just bought a crib. Had to move out of New York. I'm really enjoying the space. Just bought a stick. Pray that I don't gotta use it. But I got it there just in case. You know what it is.</p><p>People be talking online, but never say that to my face. Look at my wrist. Ain't nothing on it just yet. Everything got it's time in this place. If they throw a fit, when you tell them no. That's how you know they ain't respect you off wrist. Man, it's a trip.</p><p>But hey, it could be worse. Say it again for them in the back so they know for sure. It could be worse. Life is hard. I thank God. It could be worse. Life is hard. I thank God. It could be worse. Way, way, way, way, way, way worse. Look, it could be worse.</p><p>Used to be scared of the first. I used to pack up the merch. Go to the show. Had to put square on my phone. I used to pray that it work. Ain't always work. I used to play at the church. Daddy didn't come with no perks. Hey, what's the verse?</p><p>Come to me yellow with thirst. The guy living water for sure. Mine was a nurse. Had her whole life in her purse. Might get her face on a shirt. Tank on the waiter. Right to the table. She asked me what do I want for dessert. I told her surprise me.</p><p>Ain't much surprise me, man. All of my heels we wildin', man. Look at what happened to Cosby, man. Look at what happened to Robbie, damn. Tryna make sure that it's not me, man. Whole life would knock me, man. I'ma run when temptation come. It got me, man. But, ayy.</p><p>It could be worse. It could be worse. Life is hard. It could be worse. Life is hard. I thank God. It could be worse. Way, way, way, way, way, way worse. I thank God it can be worse. Keep trying to get back to the All-Star game, I'm trying to be my first time all-star.</p><p>You're trying to get better than this. You got to get 25 plus this year. I got to. How many? Come on, man. 25 plus. Easy. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Good. I'm trying to get him. Yeah. Come on. Good. You got him, come on.</p><p>You should wait. Get to the room. Get to the room. Get to the room. Get to the room. Good. Go ahead. Take a one. Start, brother. One. Oh. Two. Three. Three. Four. Four. Four. Five. Five. Six. Seven. Three-fourths. Four-five. Five-six. Six-seven. Eight. Nine. Nine-hands here. Ten-seven. Seven-twelve. I'm going to go to the next one.</p><p>Hey, Russ! Man, what do we have going on here? A little friendly competition, man. He got me yesterday, so I'm trying to get him back today. Four seconds. Five eight. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Here we are, man. Get up!</p><p>Good, good. Let's go, Russ. Come on, Russ. Good. Nice. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this.</p><p>Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Give me this. Nice. Backward from the top. Backward from the top. Nice. Jump. Easy.</p><p>Easy. Uh. I'm not trying to run around all games. I'm not trying to run around all games. Legs start to get heavier. You can play heavier minutes now. Really? Yeah. Nah, bro. Me and Paul, bro. What are those, bro? Just got done with a tough workout with my nig, man.</p><p>I grabbed one. I had to be bro and pig a couple times. Beat him in some shooting competitions. Oh, wow. We capping. We capping on the vlog, bro. Huh? That's crazy. Man, just finished up with my boy Trey in the gym. Got that good working. Got up a lot of jumpers today.</p><p>Did some ball handling. Just coming off of pick and rolls and different shots off of different actions. I love working out with shooters that challenge me as a shooter to get better. You know, sometimes when you're just working out by yourself, you don't have to challenge yourself and it can get a little stagnant and get a little boring.</p><p>Um, and a little hard to improve. But when you're working out with somebody that's that caliber of a shooter like Trey, or like Steph, you know, KD, somebody like that, like you have to lock in. So, it was some good work today. Um, you know, Trey's been one of my best friends ever since we were young.</p><p>Um, we played AAU together. We won a peach championship, EYBL championship together. And now to see him doing what he's doing in the league is amazing. Um, we were talking about it at the end of our workout. It's just crazy to think like he's the best player in the world at that size.</p><p>Like at that height and that weight, you know, he's the best in the world. And that's kind of crazy. You know, who would have thought when we were coming up that he would be in the position he's in now. So, I'm proud of him. We're going to continue to get this good work in throughout the, throughout the couple weeks that I'm out here.</p><p>But, uh, yeah man, I'm proud of my boy.</p></div></div></body></html>
