episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, my conversation with Dr. Lex Friedman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We meet again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We meet again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question that I think is on a lot of people's minds, or ought to be on a lot of people's minds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What is artificial intelligence, and how is it different from things like machine learning and robotics?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think of artificial intelligence, first, as a big philosophical thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's our longing to create other intelligence systems, perhaps systems more powerful than us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">At the more narrow level, I think it's also a set of tools that are computational mathematical tools to automate different tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also, it's our attempt to understand our own mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, build systems that exhibit some intelligent behavior in order to understand what is intelligence in our own selves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all those things are true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, what AI really means is a community, as a set of researchers and engineers, it's a set of tools, a set of computational techniques that allow you to solve various problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a long history that approaches the problem from different perspectives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What's always been throughout one of the threads, one of the communities, goes under the flag of machine learning, which is emphasizing in the AI space, the task of learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you make a machine that knows very little in the beginning, follow some kind of process, and learns to become better and better in a particular task?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">What's been most very effective in the recent, about 15 years, is a set of techniques that fall under the flag of deep learning that utilize neural networks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a network of these little basic computational units called neurons, artificial neurons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have, these architectures have an input and an output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They know nothing in the beginning, and they're tasked with learning something interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What that something interesting is, usually involves a particular task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of ways to talk about this and break this down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One of them is how much human supervision is required to teach this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So supervised learning, this broad category, is the neural network knows nothing in the beginning, and then it's given a bunch of examples in computer vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be examples of cats, dogs, cars, traffic signs, and then you're given the image, and you're given the ground truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of what's in that image, and when you get a large database of such image examples, where you know the truth, the neural network is able to learn by example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That's called supervised learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The question, there's a lot of fascinating questions within that, which is how do you provide the truth?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're given an image of a cat?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you provide to the computer that this image contains a cat?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you just say the entire image is a picture of a cat?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you do what's very commonly been done, which is a bounding box?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a very crude box around the cat's face saying this is a cat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you do semantic segmentation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Mind you, this is a 2D image of a cat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not a, the computer knows nothing about our three-dimensional world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just looking at a set of pixels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So semantic segmentation is drawing a nice, very crisp outline around the cat and saying that's a cat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really difficult to provide that truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the, one of the fundamental open questions in computer vision is, is that even a good representation of the truth?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's another contrasting set of ideas, their attention, their overlapping is, uh, what's used to be called unsupervised learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">What's commonly now called self-supervised learning, which is trying to get less and less and less human supervision into the, into, uh, into the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So self-supervised learning is, uh, more, uh, it's been very successful in the domain of a language model, natural language processing, and now more and more is being successful in computer vision task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's the idea there is let the machine without any ground truth annotation, just look at pictures on the internet or look at text on the internet and try to learn something, uh, generalizable about the ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that are at the core of language or at the core of vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And based on that, we humans at its best like to call that common sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So with this, we have this giant base of knowledge on top of which we build more sophisticated knowledge, but we have this kind of common sense knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea was self-supervised learning is to build this common sense knowledge about what are the fundamental visual ideas that make up a cat and a dog and all those kinds of things without ever having human supervision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the dream there is the, you just, you just let an AI system that's, uh, self-supervised run around the internet for a while, watch YouTube videos for millions and millions of hours and without any supervision, be primed and ready to actually learn with very few examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">once the human is, once the human is able to show up, we think of, uh, children in this way, human children is your parents only give one or two examples to teach a concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that the, the dream was self-supervised learning is that would be the same with, with, uh, machines that they would, uh, watch millions of hours of, uh, YouTube videos and then come to a human and be able to understand when the human shows them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a cat, like, remember this, a cat, they will understand that a cat is not just a thing with pointy ears or a cat cat is a thing that's orange or it's furry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll, they'll see something more fundamental that we humans might not actually be able to introspect and understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if I asked you what makes a cat versus a dog, you wouldn't probably not be able to answer that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I showed you brought to you a cat and a dog, you'll be able to tell the difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the ideas that your brain uses to make that difference?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, that's the whole dream of self-supervised learning is it would be able to learn that on its own, that set of common sense knowledge that's able to tell the difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's like a lot of incredible uses of self-supervised learning, uh, very weirdly called self-play mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the mechanism behind, uh, uh, the reinforcement learning successes of, uh, the systems that want it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that, uh, go at, uh, alpha zero, uh, that want to chess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I see that play games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">That play games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea of self-play is probably applies, uh, to other domains than just games is a system that just plays against itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is fascinating in all kinds of domains, but, uh, it knows nothing in the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the whole idea is it creates a bunch of mutations of itself and plays against those, uh, versions of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then through this process of interacting with systems just a little better than you, you start following this process where everybody starts getting better and better and better and better until you are several orders of magnitude better than the world champion in chess, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's fascinating because it's like a runaway system, one of the most terrifying and exciting things that, uh, David Silver, the creator of alpha go and alpha zero, one of the leaders of the team said, uh, to me is, uh, they haven't found the ceiling for alpha zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning it could just arbitrarily keep improving now in the realm of chess, that doesn't matter to us, that it's like, it just ran away with the game of chess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=489"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But the question is what, if you can create that in the realm that does have a, a bigger, deeper effect on human beings and societies, uh, that can be a terrifying process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, it's an exciting process if you supervise it correctly, if you inject, uh, if, uh, what's called, uh, value alignment, you, uh, you make sure that the goals that the AI is optimizing is aligned with human beings and human societies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of fascinating things to talk about within the, uh, specifics of neural

target="_blank">00:08:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would say the really big, exciting one is self-supervised learning, where trying to get less and less human supervision, uh, uh, less and less human supervision of neural networks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.340</a></span> | <span

exciting is not the theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's always

the, the whole space, which is a whole nother space of human robot interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">When AI systems and humans work together to accomplish tasks, that dance to me is, uh, is one of the smaller communities, but I think it would be one of the most important open problems once they're solved is how do humans and robots dance together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, semi-autonomous driving is one of those spaces.</span></div><div

see it that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">He sees, uh,

target="_blank">00:10:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like humans and robots can't dance well together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like humans and humans dance and robots and robots dance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we need to, this is an engineering problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We need to design a perfect robot that solves this problem to me forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe this is not the case with driving, but the world is going to be full of problems where it's always humans and robots have to interact because I think robots will always be flawed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Just like humans are going to be flawed are flawed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what makes life beautiful that they're flawed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where learning happens at the edge of your capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So you always have to figure out how can flawed robots and flawed humans interact together such that they, uh, like the, the sum is bigger than the whole as opposed to focusing on just building the perfect robot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so that's one of the most exciting applications I would say of artificial intelligence to me is autonomous driving and semi-autonomous driving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a really good example of machine learning because those systems are constantly learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And, uh, there's a, there's a process there that maybe I can comment on at the Andre Karpathy, who's the head of autopilot calls it the data engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And this process applies for a lot of machine learning, which is you build a system that's pretty good at doing stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You send any, you send it out into the real world, it starts doing the stuff and then it runs into what are called edge cases, like failure cases, where it screws up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we do this as kids that, you know, you, you do this as adults, we do this as adults, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But we learn really quickly, but the whole point, and this is the fascinating thing about driving is you realize there's millions of edge cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, there's just like weird situations that you did not expect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the data engine processes, you collect those edge cases and then you go back to the drawing board and learn from them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have to create this data pipeline where all these cars, hundreds of thousands of cars, that you're driving around and something weird happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so whenever this weird detector fires, it's another important concept, that piece of data goes back, uh, to the mothership for the, for the training, for the retraining of the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And through this data engine process, it keeps improving and getting better and better and better and better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically you send out a pretty clever AI systems out into the world and let it find the edge cases, let it screw up just enough to figure out where the edge cases are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then go back and learn from them and then send out that new version and keep updating that version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the fascinating things about humans is we figure out objective functions for ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we are, um, it's the meaning of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why the hell are we here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And, uh, a machine currently has to have, uh, a hard coded statement about why it has to have a meaning of artificial intelligence based life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. If you want a machine to be able to be good at stuff, it has to be given very clear statements of what good at stuff means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That's one of the challenges of artificial intelligence is in order to solve a problem, you have to formalize it and you have to provide, uh, both like the full sensory information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to be very clear about what is the data that's being collected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to also be clear about the objective function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the goal that you're trying to reach ultimately currently the, uh, there has to be a formal objective function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you could argue that humans also has a set of objective functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">We're trying to optimize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We're just not able to introspect them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't actually know what we're looking for and seeking and doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you've already told us the answer, but does interacting with a robot change you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it, in other words, do, do we develop relationships to robots?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe that most people have, uh, a notion of loneliness in them that we haven't discovered that, that we haven't explored, I should say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I see AI systems as helping us explore that so that we can become better humans, uh, better people towards each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that connection between human and AI human and robot, uh, is, is not only possible, but, uh, will help us understand ourselves in ways that are like several orders of magnitude, uh, deeper than we ever could have imagined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I think about human relationships, I, I don't, um, always break them down into variables, but we could explore a few of those variables and see how they map to human robot relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, one is just time, uh, if you spend zero time with another person, uh, at all in, in cyberspace or on the phone or in person, you essentially have no relationship to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If you spend a lot of time, you have a relationship, this is obvious, but I guess one variable would be time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">How much time you spend with the other entity, robot or human, the other would be, um, wins and successes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you enjoy successes together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The other would be failures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">When you struggle with somebody, you know, when you struggle with somebody, you grow closer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've never conceptualized robot human interactions this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, um, so tell me more about how this might look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we thinking about, um, a human appearing robot?</span></div><div

relationship?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's, uh, a lot to be said here, but you actually pinpointed one of the big, big first steps, which is this idea of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that time element, forget everything else, just sharing moments together, that changes everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe that changes everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, there's specific things that are more in terms of systems that I can explain you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's, it's more technical and probably a little bit offline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause I have kind of wild ideas how that can revolutionize, um, social networks and,

Uh, so I think someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">from MIT told me that term.

They're able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1669" target="_blank">00:27:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to lock us up to lock us up in, uh, in it, you know, like to have so much control that we basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">cannot live our lives in the way that we want.

I'm, I'm concerned about their internalization. Um, so that's something I'm still,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm still iterating.

He was just born</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2293" target="_blank">00:38:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that way, but was what was so beautiful is that his toughness is never what he rolled forward. It was just how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">sweet and kind he was.

They made a song that's catchy now. That's not making me feel horrible saying it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">but like, is the loss, the loss really also is making you realize how much that person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that dog meant to you and like allowing yourself to feel that loss and not run away from that loss</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is really powerful.
