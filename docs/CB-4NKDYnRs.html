Awesome. Let's get into it. So if there's one thing that we want you to take away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">from this session, it's to stop the AI sideshow, which I know sounds a little bit counterintuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We're all at an AI conference. All of us are talking about agents and AI. It's all over the place,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So what exactly are we talking about here? Having AI leading your products, your go-to-market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">your strategy. This was a really great approach when we were all trying to communicate that we were at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">forefront of this technological disruption, right? But now everyone is really kind of saying the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we look at the different products that have resulted in hindsight, which hindsight's kind of 2020,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We're able to see that what we've been doing is building product to try to figure out what these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">different technological breakthroughs can do for us. So let's unpack what we're talking about here a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go back maybe post-chat GPT, maybe for some of us in the room pre-GPT, but whenever your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of aha moment was with LLMs, trying to figure out what you can do with the tech, what you can't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">what the boundaries are, we ended up using chat UIs, content UIs, existing applications, right? To be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">really test the boundaries of these LLMs. We were also using multimodal to see what different kinds of inputs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and outputs we could use the technology for. Then we realized we could ground the models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We had vector databases and RAG. We were trying to get to accuracy and truth, if we can agree on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We had larger context windows and increased memory. We also weren't super, I would say, comfortable with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">having AI do work for us. So everything was a co-pilot, right? A buddy next to us who can help us get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">things done, but we don't want to be taking anybody's jobs away. We don't want to be sort of automating work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">until we realized that might actually be kind of nice to be able to have agents that can do things for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to reason, to be able to use tools and various APIs to orchestrate across different business problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the state and sort of space I would say that we're in right now. We're not saying that these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">different approaches are wrong, but they're an approach to understand the technology. And it's not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">build you a differentiated strategy because everyone is doing the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So why do we see these kind of like bolt-on, non-differentiated AI products persist?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">By working across dozens of enterprise companies at Freeplay, we've noticed a common trend emerge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">which is companies know they rightly need to prioritize AI, but the way they do that is by creating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this sort of centralized AI strategy. And what happens is this centralized AI strategy starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">running as this sort of sidecar to their core product strategy, rather than the two be deeply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">integrated. There's different initiatives, sometimes even different teams. And then naturally, these sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of like bolt-on non-integrated AI features and products start to proliferate. So what are some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">causes of this sort of AI sideshow that we're talking about here? The first is that companies seek to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">mitigate the risk associated with AI by quarantining into specific corners of the product, albeit there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">like is new risk here, right? There's this new reliability question you have to ask yourself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like, can I even get this feature to work reliably enough to drive value for customers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Second, we see teams prioritizing the technology over their customer needs. They become the hammer in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">search of the nail. Rather than trying to solve their customer problems by harnessing the technology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">they're just trying to find any manifestation of that technology. And we see this manifest in a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of predictable ways. We see teams building chatbots because chatbots demonstrate AI capability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">not because customers are actually struggling with support. We see companies building document</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">summarization, again, because it demonstrates capability, not because their users are suffering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">with information overload. And finally, we see companies creating this kind of top-down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the pushing solutions out from the top-down rather than setting that top-level strategy and letting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the bottoms-up discovery process be the manifestation of that priority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you avoid the AI sideshow here? The key is to integrate and align your AI and your product,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and integrating AI risk into planning is a critical part of that. There is this new risk we're talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but instead of being shying away from that risk and trying to quarantine AI to specific corners</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of the product or specific teams, you need to deeply integrate that into your product planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And this will require like some new muscles here, right? Like you need to kind of build these systems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">for evaluation, for testing, because if you're doing good prototyping and testing, you can at least kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of wrap your arms around that risk and know how to handle it. And then second, start with the customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. If you're inventing new problems to go solve with the advent of AI, you're probably gone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">astray here. And finally, like we talked about, enable that bottoms-up discovery process for AI products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's likely your product folks who are boots on the ground every day, who understand the right solutions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">here, give them the space to experiment, prototype, and importantly, fail fast, but set that top-line strategy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and then allow the bottoms-up discovery process to take place. This is how you ultimately manifest AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">products that feel like a natural and cohesive part of the product experience, rather than feeling bolt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">on. And that's ultimately the like, the hallmark of good successful AI integration are AI products that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">need not announce themselves as AI, but rather just solve the customer problem better than what came before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So the north star that Aliza and I are talking about today are AI products that are deeply and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">dynamically integrated into your product ecosystem.

And importantly, avoiding the AI sideshow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">This is admittedly like an audacious north star. And especially if you're kind of stuck in this sideshow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">model, like how do you find your way out?

Because what that allows you to do is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">allows you to sort of build the capability iteratively while laying the foundation of that AI functionality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout your product suite. So I want to like walk through an example here. With an example, we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">take like a customer support SaaS company, let's say they have like a shared inbox feature that customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">support teams come on to work out of mature product, but they want to start integrating AI. So in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">crawl phase, you're starting to build embedded AI experiences. You're likely in this phase, not building a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">whole lot of new product surface area. Rather, you're just like adding AI on the back end and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">starting to kind of accentuate and accelerate the existing functionality you have. If we take that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">customer support example, that might look something like, you know, building a feature that uses semantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">search to like surface previous similar questions to help the user ground when they like are responding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to their customer. And then in the walk phase, this is where we're starting to build more contextual and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">personalized AI experiences. Here we might actually we are starting to build like new product surface area,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're probably not at the point yet where we need to like fundamentally rethink our core app</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture and our UX. If we go back to that example, that might look something like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">building a feature that will like suggest a draft ahead of time so that when the user comes in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there's already a draft there ready to go for them to start from. And then finally, where we land when we really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">start to run, this is where we're building those dynamic, interoperable and integrated AI experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout our product suite. This is the stage where you do start needing to like re fundamentally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">rethink your UI, your UX and your app architecture. Because now your AI features like if we go back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">our customer support example, it might look like an autonomous agent that can triage issues respond to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">customers. But importantly, it's operating across the product and and feature set. And in order to incorporate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of functionality, you do need to start rebuilding core surface area and like starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to revisit your UX. But importantly, along the way, you're not throwing out functionality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it's building on top of each other, it's that functionality is building as you go, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you're just extending on it. And importantly, even at the crawl phase, you're still building embedded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">functionality, not this sort of like bolt on non integrated functionality. So I'll pass it to Aliza now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so let's walk through a tangible example here, because there's a lot to unpack. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">this problem space, I feel like everyone knows this, I've been living and breathing it for a few years. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">HR service delivery or employee self service is all of us work in jobs, or you're running a company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">your employees need to be able to get their questions answered quickly. And if they can't get those questions answered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">they need help from a support person. So through a case, this could be a live agent, etc. So we've spent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of time working in this space. This is also where some products have found product market fit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">especially with early sort of gen AI solutions. So where we started to, I would say, crawl with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">technology, this was within our help product. So help has two components, there's a knowledge based solution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">there's also a case management solution. And so early days, we took a look at the tech and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">where can we use gen AI really to affect change with customers. And so I know knowledge base has become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">like the back end for GPTs and just a best practice. But at the time we said, okay, we've got content gen in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">here, we've got translations in here, this is the content that's fueling the answers to all of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">questions that employees are asking. And so there were two key features. So one was actually content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">authors, so they might come into an editor like this, they are going to upload, say, a policy doc. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">imagine a benefits policy, like 20 plus pages long, they don't want to necessarily write that article,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">right? But they could have the AI ingest it, create an employee FAQ. In this case, we had talking points for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">managers, and they're able to get a consistent format. So the other thing I would mention is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">we're thinking about content at scale. So this isn't for small sort of SMBs, this is large enterprise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">who have content teams of say, like three to 15 people. And so you need to have a united sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">voice around that content that's coming out. So on top of that other feature, we put this translations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">which you can see in the GIF here. In just a couple of clicks, I can go in and translate into one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">34 different languages that we support. And you see we added on the left hand panel here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and the ability to actually manage versions as well. So I might have my base article,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm generating talking points in English, and then I want to translate into French and Spanish,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe Japanese. And you can see that you're managing those versions as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">A couple of things I want to call out here. Yes, we're using Gen AI and translations. But this isn't in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in your face sparkles and chatbots and text fields all over the place. This was built for users who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't know about Gen AI, this is 2023, wanted to be able to kind of get in and use the features without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">actually understanding the functionality. And it also, you know, keeping that human in the loop, we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">have the disclaimer around AI. And so we make sure that we've got enough little purple sparkles to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">let them know what they're using. But it's not the entire experience here. So this allowed us to go GA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in 2024, or August, I should say, and sort of, I would say, kind of crawling with the functionality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So on top of that, so that's our content teams. So then we moved into what I would say is walking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This was, now we have our content drafted, but we actually need to solve the self-service problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So as a manager, I might need to come in, Elaine in this case is trying to do a location change to San</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Francisco. And she knows a lot of the fields, but not all of them. And so she now has this sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">contextually aware co-pilot Workday Assistant that lives across Workday that she can sort of prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of us are familiar with this functionality, but a couple of points I want to make here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">One, we have the contextually aware suggestions, so it knows what's happening when I'm on the page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Also around the data processing, if you're looking at a help article, it's generally customer content,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">which is sensitive, but not nearly as sensitive as PII or personally identifiable information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about these tasks more on safe pay or compensation, things that are really sensitive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">where employees are putting really sensitive information in. So this is the next level of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of walking with the capabilities. The other piece I'd mention is that this was a platform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">capability, meaning that we had to be working across our suite. So we have HCM and financials,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">think benefits, procurement, core HCM, etc. And so there's a higher level of sort of top down and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">bottoms up alignment that had to happen to get these capabilities out the door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Then finally, running. So extending the same use case here, you may have seen a few months back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">we announced our agent system of record. A subset of that functionality targeted towards, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">those employees and managers was really around the agentic capabilities behind the Workday Assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, our users don't necessarily want to know or have the sort of technical expertise around agents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">but we still have that work happening behind the scenes, where our assistant becomes a lot more autonomous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">proactive, listening to policy changes, notifying us with suggestions as well. And so you can see just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking through this at scale, there's a much higher level of, I would say, sort of top-down strategy with bottoms-up execution that then happens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">threading the needle across these different product experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see here we've kind of gone from a single product within a SKU all the way across our sort of core platform, which some of you may know or not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but we serve like 60% of the S&P 500, so a pretty broad group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So where we would land with all of this when we talk about not making AI a sideshow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not telling you to stop working on agents or stop caring about AI, but understand that these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">stepping stones in terms of teaching your organization, training up your organization on what it means to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">actually be building impactful AI experiences. And so as you sort of, I would say, mature as an organization,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">ideally where we want to get to is building dynamic products. I'm hearing some of this today in some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the talks, if you heard Sarah or Brian talking earlier, about building purposeful sort of vertical specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">products. I think it's really interesting when we start thinking about dynamic products in terms of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">new problem spaces. I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but sometimes I feel like we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">solving yesterday's roadmap with just like a much more powerful technology. And so as we digitize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">new data, new inputs in terms of our environment and spaces, we can see the problem space of the products</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're creating really sort of extend. I think especially with multimodal, this is where this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">gets really compelling as well. When we have frictionless multimodal experiences that interoperate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say interoperability and RL are still pretty relevant within the agent sphere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But when we think about dynamic products that are sort of responsive to your environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">this is where we really start to see, I would say, the next generation of products come into play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully this sparked a few thoughts, maybe some questions.
