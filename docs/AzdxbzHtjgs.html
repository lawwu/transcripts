And by listened, I mean I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">went through it Netflix binge-style at least five episodes in a row. It's not one of my favorite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">podcasts, and I think it should be one of the top podcasts in the world, frankly. It's a history show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">about why people resist new things.

And now, here's my conversation with Michael Kearns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in high school and having a more or a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">more of a literary mind. So, what books, non-technical, non-computer science, would you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">say had the biggest impact on your life, either intellectually or emotionally?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You've dug deep into my history, I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Went deep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think, well, my favorite novel is Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, coincidentally, much of it takes place in the halls of buildings right around us here at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">MIT. So, that certainly had a big influence on me. And as you noticed, like when I was in high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">school, I actually even started college as an English major. So, I was very influenced by sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of that genre of journalism at the time and thought I wanted to be a writer and then realized that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">an English major teaches you to read, but it doesn't teach you how to write. And then I became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in math and computer science instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in your new book, Ethical Algorithm, you kind of sneak up from an algorithmic perspective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on these deep, profound philosophical questions of fairness, of privacy. In thinking about these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">topics, how often do you return to that literary mind that you had?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'd like to claim there was a deeper connection, but I think both Aaron and I kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of came at these topics first and foremost from a technical angle. I mean, I kind of consider myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">primarily and originally a machine learning researcher. And I think as we just watched,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like the rest of the society, the field technically advance, and then quickly on the heels of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of the buzzkill of all of the antisocial behavior by algorithms, just kind of realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there was an opportunity for us to do something about it from a research perspective. More to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the point of your question, I mean, I do have an uncle who is literally a moral philosopher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in the early days of our technical work on fairness topics, I would occasionally run ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">behind him. So I mean, I remember an early email I sent to him in which I said like, "Oh, here's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">specific definition of algorithmic fairness that we think is some sort of variant of Rawlsian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fairness. What do you think?" And I thought I was asking a yes or no question, and I got back to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of classical philosopher's response. "Well, it depends. If you look at it this way, then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">might conclude this." And that's when I realized that there was a real kind of rift between the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">ways philosophers and others had thought about things like fairness from sort of a humanitarian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective and the way that you needed to think about it as a computer scientist if you were going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of implement actual algorithmic solutions. - But I would say the algorithmic solutions take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">care of some of the low-hanging fruit.

And when they don't consider privacy, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">terribly, they violate privacy. Sort of the algorithmic approach fixes big problems. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">there is still, when you start pushing into the gray area, that's when you start getting into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this philosophy of what it means to be fair, starting from Plato, what is justice kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">questions. - Yeah, I think that's right. And I mean, I would even not go as far as you went to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">say that sort of the algorithmic work in these areas is solving like the biggest problems. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we discuss in the book the fact that really we are, there's a sense in which we're kind of looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where the light is in that, for example, if police are racist in who they decide to stop and frisk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and that goes into the data, there's sort of no undoing that downstream by kind of clever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithmic methods.

And I took a lot of other courses, as we discussed, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=6331" target="_blank">01:45:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">started as an English major and took history courses and art history classes and had friends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=6337" target="_blank">01:45:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that did all kinds of different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=6338" target="_blank">01:45:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And Harvard's a much smaller institution than Berkeley, and its computer science department,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&t=6344" target="_blank">01:45:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">especially at that time, was a much smaller place than it is now.
