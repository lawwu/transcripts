Good to meet you. So, as Max mentioned, we have glasses here. We start with a foundation of great glasses, something stylish, lightweight, wearable. I'm going to say how can we build great technology and experiences on top of that. One of the core tenets of the Android XR platform, this idea of a multimodal conversational device, see what you see, hear what you hear.</p><p>So, you've got a camera, you've got speakers, multiple microphones for speaker isolation. I'll give you a chance to try these yourself. Yeah, sorry, I woke it up there. Whoa. Yeah. So, the first thing you see, simple, straightforward home screen. Yes. So, you probably see the time, the weather, calendar appointments there.</p><p>This is designed to be sort of your one-stop shop for quick glanceable information throughout the day. We want to do something that's easy to get what you need and then go back to what you're doing. So, you can imagine turning on the display, getting that quick glance and then continuing on your way.</p><p>You can be fully conversational at this point. You can ask questions, for example, about the paintings. You can interrupt. You can ask follow-up questions. As I mentioned before, if you want to at any time pause, you just tap there on the right. Gemini, how much does this painting cost?</p><p>The painting is called The Bridge of Leifelib, 1875, by Armand Guillaumet. It appears to be a print and it would be impossible to know its cost without finding the seller. Okay, so this is fake. I understand. Why do humans pay so much money for paintings? People pay a lot for paintings because of their artistic merit.</p><p>The artist's paying is a decent rarity and for the appreciation you learn. Did you catch Google I/O last week by any chance? Yes. So, you might have seen on stage the Google Maps experience very briefly. I wanted to give you a chance to get a sense of what that feels like today.</p><p>You can imagine you're walking down the street. If you look up, like you're walking straight ahead, you get quick turn-by-turn directions. So, you have a sense of what the next turn is like. Nice. Keeping your phone in your pocket. Oh, that's so intuitive. Sometimes you need that quick sense of which way is the right way.</p><p>Sometimes. So, let's say you're coming out of subway, getting out of a cab. You can just glance down at your feet. We have it set up to translate from Russian to English. I think I get to wear the glasses and you can speak to me if you don't mind.</p><p>I can speak Russian. Привет, друг. Как у тебя дела? I'm doing well. How are you doing? Tempted to swear, tempted to say inappropriate things. А ты сразу мой голос слышишь или подождать надо? I see it transcribed in real time, and so, obviously, you know, based on the different languages and sequence of subjects and verbs, there's a slight delay sometimes, but it's really just like subtitles for the real world.</p><p>Cool. Thank you for this. Thank you for watching this clip. Please subscribe to the Lex Friedman YouTube channel and consider watching the full episode of the podcast.</p></div></div></body></html>
