That to me just seems like the ultimate form of agony. So presumably a bereavement group for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is very different than a bereavement group for someone who's really truly mourning the, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">know, the separation from a spouse, right?

And then I'll also ask the question I just asked, which is, why is it that knowing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">other people suffer too only provides mild support for grieving? Yeah. There's a fairly recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">movement that we might call the public health model of bereavement support. And so the idea here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that, and this largely comes out of Europe, Canada, Australia, where they're trying to actually develop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">health care around bereavement. Part of this is because we can talk about how we know that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">physical cost of the loss of a loved one is so impactful on us, it can lead to dying of a heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">attack, right? So we know that, for example, the day that a loved one dies, you are 21 times more likely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to have a heart attack than any other day of your life. 21 times. And we know that in the first three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">months after the death of his wife, a man is nearly twice as likely to have a fatal heart attack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">compared to a man who remains married during that same time. Wow. Even if he has other support? Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Isn't that just crazy? For women, it's about 1.8 times. So still just an astronomical number for medical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">risk. So what we know is this period of transformation is incredibly risky, right? So we can have all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">physiological change, but if our body isn't resilient enough, where it actually breaks during that time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this is something we need to get ahead of. So thinking about this public health model of bereavement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we can think of sort of at the foundation, even just understanding in a grief literacy kind of way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what can I expect? What is happening to me? Why is this happening to me? That is a psychoeducation level</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that is vitally important to people, regardless of sort of how much support they have. Now, many people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">will go to bereavement support groups even just to get that, right? Even just to get good evidence-based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">information. Places that are no longer teaching the five stages of grieving, for example. And beyond that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we know how important support is. Social support, having loved ones around, just as you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">describing. And I think one of the reasons, I mean, imagine in that first seven days after your spouse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">dies, if there is someone in your house sitting Shiva, they are going to notice if you have a heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">attack, right? So think about the idea that we might outsource our physiological regulation for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Think of it this way. When we bond with someone, when you fall in love with your partner, say, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">example, they become your external pacemaker, right? Think about co-regulation. If I go home now and I get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a hug from my partner, just the way you were describing, I know that my blood pressure will drop a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">bit. My heart rate will drop a little bit. Now suddenly I have to imagine walking into an empty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">house where that's not going to happen. My cardiovascular system has to figure out how am I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to walk into my home again and again and again and regulate my heart rate. And your brain is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">anticipating seeing the person that you lost. Yes, exactly. Like it doesn't, you can know, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">action systems, the go circuitry, if it were. All the subconscious processing, I should be, I'm doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the same motion of turning the key in the lock that I've always done. And now there's a hole in the room</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">when I enter it. And often it still smells like them. Absolutely. I think people really underestimate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing about smell because it's operating at an unconscious level all the time. We're like bathing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody else's chemicals and then they're gone and then it starts dissipating. But it's still there for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely. So I think recognizing your grieving body has to figure out how to regulate again is one reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">support is so important. There's a study of primates where, you know, as with other primates, there's a lot of infant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">mortality. And in this observational study, there are troops that are being observed by scientists. And with the death</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of an infant primate, the mother will often carry that deceased infant, that baby monkey, for a long time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">after their death and spend a lot of time looking at the infant. The mother doesn't groom. She doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">try to nurse. She's not confused that the infant is alive. But what is interesting is she stops grooming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">herself during this time. Now, that's actually medically risky for a primate because we know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">grooming is so important to their health to get rid of parasites and such. And, you know, usually in these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">troops, there's a really strict hierarchy. Who gets to groom who is, you know, the latest Kardashian show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of thing. And during this time, when the mother is trying to understand what's happened to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">infant, the rules go out the window. Any member of the troop can groom this mother. Now, at some point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">wide individual variation in how long the mother holds this infant from days to months. Once she relinquishes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the infant, the rules go back into effect. So she goes back to the troop and now she participates in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">social life, in medical social life, in the way that she did before. I think the analogy here, in addition to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">every time I think about it, it just rips my heart a little bit, right? But the idea here is that it is all of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">jobs to groom the mourning person, to care for them, to say, hey, how long has it been since you saw your doctor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for your regular checkup? How long has it been since you had your mammogram or got your teeth cleaned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Often we've been caring for a loved one who's dying and we're neglecting our own medical care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because here's the thing. Grief is the natural response. Our bodies are resilient. Many people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">shocked by how much pain, physical pain, how they get a lump in their throat or they feel like their chest is on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">fire when they're grieving. But actually our bodies are remarkably resilient. We do learn to re-regulate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">without this external pacemaker. But in those instances where the body isn't resilient enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to do that, we need people around us supporting us. In a study in my own lab, we thought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">well, probably this risk for a broken heart, this risk of dying of a heart attack, isn't, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">24-7 equally risky. So we brought people into the lab and had them experience a wave of grief while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">they were hooked up to ECG and blood pressure and so forth. And what we saw was everybody's blood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pressure goes up during a wave of grief. That's probably not too surprising. But what we saw was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the people who, when they walked in the door, told us they were having the most intense grief,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">their blood pressure went up the most. And then in a replication study in Germany, we saw that their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">blood pressure didn't recover. So you can see that these waves of grief that our body and our mind and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">our brain have to learn how to cope with and then eventually to adapt to. Those require a physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">body that can sustain that. They require relationships that can support us and sustain that. And this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">why I think support is so important, even though it doesn't take away the pain of missing your person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Because we need every resource we can muster in the midst of this moment. Now, it does also mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that as much as we are missing our person and it feels so isolating to try and explain that there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hole in the room when no one else can see that hole, it does help at some level to talk to this other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">person who is seeing a different hole in the room, who's also going through grief, because we recognize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">grieving is a human experience. And that you're not connected because you both miss the same person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but you are connected because you're both missing, right? And so I think that bereavement support can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">incredibly helpful to connect with others who are going through this same process. And frankly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't recommend and some bereavement support groups actually prohibit dating relationships from a grief</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">support group. But the reality is the people that we connect with are also people potentially that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">develop stronger attachment bonds with. That's how community works, right? And so I think bereavement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">support can be incredibly important. We do know for the one out of 10 who develop a disordered grieving who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">really are not showing any changes over time, even though time is passing, those people might need a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">specific evidence-based psychotherapy intervention because we know that those psychology interventions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">can get us back on a normal or typical grieving trajectory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS7IdUvpLjo&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So,</span></div></div></body></html>
