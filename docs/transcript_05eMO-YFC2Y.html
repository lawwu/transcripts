What is the line that pushes a task or process to be physical or digital?" Well, Pal, for me, when I think about physical artifacts, so let's say a really good notebook and pen, for example, I tend to think about these being appropriate for contemplative activities, activities that are going to benefit from slowing down and giving something careful, reflective thought.</p><p>On the other hand, when I think of digital tools involved with the organization of my life, I think of efficiency as what's at play here. Okay, I've got a tool where I can capture everything and move things around and get information in there so I can minimize the time I waste on that type of organization so I can spend more time actually executing.</p><p>So typically, most of my tools, most of my tools in my workday are digital. That's where I keep track of my calendar and where I have my task boards. And I write out my quarterly plans are stored in digital documents, but then I shift to paper for my daily time block plan, because as I'm going through my day, there are going to be points where I want to slow down.</p><p>I'm trying to think something through. I'm trying to understand a book chapter, and I want to be away from efficiency and towards contemplative. So I go towards a physical artifact. I'm also big on these physical analog artifacts for non-professional reflection and planning. So this is why I use a paper moleskin notebook to keep track of ideas about living a deeper life.</p><p>It's the right modality for that. That's a contemplative question. That's a question that's going to be serviced by time. This can be serviced by slowing down. The same way that would be serviced by slowing down. I wouldn't want to use a physical notebook, let's say, to keep track of all my tasks, because often when I'm trying to get to my task and figure out what I should be working on in this 30-minute window I have free, I don't want to be slowing down.</p><p>I don't want to be flipping through pages. I don't want to be recopying tasks from one page to another. I want that to be as fast as possible. I want efficiency. So that's how I balance it when it comes to efficiency digital. When it comes to highlighting contemplativeness, I'll go with the analog artifact.</p></div></div></body></html>
