Our energy resources, which are basically thermal, it's quite difficult to make electricity comparatively. And so what we use electricity for is stuff we really want to use electricity for. So it's hard to imagine that we're not going to turn our air conditioner off.</p><p>We're going to run it. Whereas if you look at really closely at a lot of the use cases that use tons of extra energy, they're much more flexible in how they use the energy. And there's not a whole lot of storage involved. If you're looking at growing crops, or making methane for rocket fuel, or making chemicals, you can design these processes to run when the energy is available.</p><p>You're basically getting to the point where you're making batteries out of dirt. Because that's how you scale it. It's just how many battery factories you want to build.</p></div></div></body></html>
