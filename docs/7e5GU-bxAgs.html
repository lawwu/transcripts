But I do think, yeah, it's realistic to say, no, not every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">professional objective, ambitious professional objective you have is necessarily achievable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And this might be because of talent. My personal view is that talent is a complicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">picture because it involves a lot of training. And it involves the circumstances for training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It might involve maybe your personality is well-suited to stick with certain types of training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not a big believer in this, just you have this talent that makes it doing really complicated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">high-level work easy for you. High-level complicated work requires a lot of training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But some people end up, now you're 20 years old, and for whatever reason, you've been exposed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and have done a lot of that training. And someone who hasn't, you're in two different places. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">find talent to be a vague issue. So I don't typically use that term. But I do think it's true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, not every objective is open to everyone. So for example, I'm going to first be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what would you call it, sort of braggadocious. And then I'm going to humble myself. Right? I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">use myself as an example. Because you mentioned PhD from MIT. All right. So when I was in college,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for whatever reason, I found the computer science work, especially the mathematical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">or theoretical computer science work, pretty easy. Right? And I always used to think, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that must be because I had good study habits. I managed my time well, or this or that. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">received an email like a year or two ago from the fellow student who I used to work with on my theory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and algorithms problem sets. And this was the student I like to work with because he was very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sharp and we would be very efficient together. And I guess he saw one of my articles or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And he sent me a message and said, oh, it was cool to see whatever some article he saw of mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, my memory from Dartmouth was working with you on some of these problem sets or whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd working on was, oh, I can't do that. I know now I'm not going to be a professor, this or that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess that's what it looks like when someone has a really strong aptitude for something. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that was his memory, is that it caught his attention and tempered his ambition, seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">me working on these problem sets. So I guess there was some sort of thing there that made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">me good at that. But then I go to MIT and it became clear after a while of, oh, the top people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">here, the people who are going to be at the top of the theoretical computer science field,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm never going to be that. So there's things you can do, things you can't do. So for whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reason, I was pretty good at this stuff, but also not the best in the world. And I'm not sure if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">would have been able to get to the best of the world. So I don't know, I'm sort of wandering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">here, which is my way of saying of like, yeah, there are some limits to what you can do. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">more obvious with physical stuff. I'm not going to play professional sports. I'm still holding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">out hope I'm going to play professional baseball, but I think that window is closing pretty rapidly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So it's more obvious there than with intellectual stuff. I think people have more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">gives and they realize, but some of this stuff gets baked in over a decade of training. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">really hard to say, but all right, let's put that all aside then and say, so what do we do about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I say, let's forget about that. Let's forget about talent. Let's forget about, can I do anything I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">want to do? And ask the better question. What is the real advantage you get from working smarter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5GU-bxAgs&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and deeper?
