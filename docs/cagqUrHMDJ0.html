And actually what we might do is have a look at something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Raddick put on the forums because I kind of want to have all the stuff we want to include</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">there and then we can automate the whole thing. Yeah, here's Raddick's thing. Okay, so Raddick,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">do you want to tell us about what this thing is? What your project, your goal, or what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is, yeah, what's this forum post about? This is another of Raddick's crazy inventions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but essentially this is how I learned, right? So if I, this is the first AI way of learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think of this as the first AI way of learning. So for those who haven't read it yet, can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you just take us through what it is? Oh, yeah, absolutely. So yesterday in the works through,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we covered some material and I wanted to find a fun way to practice it. So I went to Kaggle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked for competitions and there was a competition that seemed like participating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in it could allow me to practice what we learned about the work through. So I created this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as a resource for others. You know, I've been creating such things for a couple of years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">now and maybe it requires also a little bit of understanding of Kaggle, which somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">who has not played around with Kaggle yet, they might not have it. So I thought, Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">let me put this together, share it with others. So this is a getting started part with a community</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">competition. It features images of plants. And you're supposed to detect one of nine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or one of 10 classes of plant diseases that they can be affected with. I haven't looked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">too much at the data. Essentially, I relied on first AI's functionality, where if I present</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the image data loaders, and then by that token, if I present the learner with data that seems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to be appropriately formatted, then the learner will do the rest. So I tried to bridge through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this as quickly as I could just to put it together and to practice on my own as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">while doing this. And hopefully this can be useful to others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Great. Shall we try going it through together? There's somebody's got a fast AI one here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">already. Sounds fun. Let's try it. So that's great. And I like the fact that you're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to run it on paper space rather than on Kaggle. I think that's good practice. So let's do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing that Radek did. So on Kaggle, you can see all the competitions that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">running, active competitions. So there are various different types, right? There's kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the normal ones that have money involved. And as well as having money involved, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">also have ranking points. So that gives you the opportunity to try to become a master</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or grandmaster or whatever by getting ranking points. Then there are some which are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for kudos. So there's no money involved and no ranking points. And you can kind of use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the little buttons at the top to find getting started competitions. So those are just knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Some have prizes. I wonder what prizes they have. A TPU star. 20 extra hours of TPU time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for four weeks. There you go. Kind of sounds like a drug. Like you use TPUs to win and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then you need more to keep going. I love it. And then there's also playground competitions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which they kind of repeat each month. All right. So looks like Radek's picked out a kudos competition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're not going to get any money or ranking points. We're just doing it for the enjoyment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and the learning. So we have to click, before you can download the data, you have to click</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">join competition. And this is a really common mistake people make is they try to download</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the data without doing that. You'll get an error. So as it says you can download the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">data by running this command here.

So we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to install it.

But it's possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of distributions around. >> I could be confusing with, like, user local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">bin or whatever. There's some of them on Mac. >> Yeah, slash user slash local slash bin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is not in your home directory, and that is always part of your path. But this is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in your home directory. >> Oh, yeah. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">>> All right. Okay. So, by default, Ubuntu has a bunch of stuff in your bash RC, by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">way. So, I'm just going to go to the bottom. So, to go to the bottom in Vim, it's shift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">G to go to the bottom. And then O to open up a new line underneath this one. So, insert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">beneath. And so, we will export path equals Tilda slash dot local slash bin. And then colon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and then everything that's already in your path. So, that prepends it to our path. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I could close and reopen my bash RC, or I can re-execute it. And any exported variables</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to go into my shell. So, to execute stuff and put variables into your current</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">shell, you can type source. So, source dot bash RC is going to save me having to close</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and reopen my terminal. And dot bash RC is the last thing on the last line. So, I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">just do that. And so now we can Kaggle. Okay. So, the next thing we need is somewhere to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">authenticate. And Kaggle uses something called Kaggle dot JSON to do that. So, if I go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Kaggle, you can grab it. There we are. You can grab it by clicking create new API token.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that will do is it will download a file called Kaggle dot JSON to your computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, once it's downloaded, depending on where you are on Mac, it might be in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Twitter slash downloads directory. And on Windows, it will be in slash mount slash C</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is your Windows C drive. And it will be in your user's user name downloads directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they say it needs to be in a directory called dot Kaggle. So, I'll go make dot Kaggle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's probably just created that for us when we tried to run it. That's good. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">now I can copy it. And in this case, I think what I'm going to do is just copy it from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">my other account. Copy dot Kaggle slash there's my JSON. And I'll copy it into my by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so I want to get the JPH 00's home directory. So, tilde JPH 00 refers to the home directory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">belonging to JPH 00. Tilde on its own means the current user's own directory. So, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going to copy it over to dot Kaggle. There we go. And change its ownership so it's owned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">by JPH 00. So, you won't have to do this because you'll be downloading it and copying it from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">downloads. I'm just doing this because I'm copying it from a different user. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yep, that now belongs to JPH 00. So, now I should be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">go back into that username and type Kaggle. Okay, great. So, I've got Kaggle installed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll do a check from time to time to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whether anything's working.

So, the Kaggle competition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">said we can download it with this command.

Because things like this, like, pretty much most tools are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Python libraries. Like, pip is the main thing people are kind of targeting. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you can be sure that that's going to be the most recent version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless the documentation explicitly says, like, we provide kind of packages as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there's often a good chance that the kind of packages will be behind. So, if I was going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">do a member install, I would be inclined to, like, double check that this is actually the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">most recent version. But, yeah, as you see, I just use pip anyway, I suspect, for something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">>> This used to be the case that you -- I remember something about, like, cookies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and there was a browser extension and maybe you had your own tool for this.

So, I'm just going to go back to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">normal user. So, you know, copy tilde jph00, get patty disease classification. I'm going to copy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that here. So, you can use SCP to copy a file to another machine. And off that goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how does it know what local colon is? So, there's a very underutilized handy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">file called .ssh/config where you can type things like host local. And when I SSH to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it will actually SSH to this host name. And it will actually use this user name. And it will set up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we haven't talked about SSH forwarding, but if you know about that, it will set up SSH forwarding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is just a little trick for people who do use SSH, that using the SSH config file is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not just for SSH, it's also for anything that uses SSH, including SCP. SCP is a secure copy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">over SSH. All right. So, now that's done, I can log in to that machine. And now we're on a GPU</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">machine. So, to check your GPUs, you can type nvidia-smi. And so, this has got three GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can move that file, I just copy it into here, into here. So, should we use SCP or Rsync?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, that's fine. Yeah. I use SCP just because I don't have to type any flags to it. Strictly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking, SCP is kind of considered deprecated nowadays, but it actually works fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Unzip that. Cool. Okay. Making good progress. Let's see what we've got. Okay. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a sample submission.csv, there's a train.csv, train images, test images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, ls train images, if this has got like 10,000 things in it, that's going to be annoying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you pipe to head, so remember this vertical bar is called pipe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">means take the input of this, output of this program and pass it in as the input to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">program. And this program shows you the first 10 lines of its input. Okay. So, actually, it turns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">out that's got folders for each category. So, I don't really need to pipe it to head. Okay. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">so then we could do the same thing with one of these, bacterial leaf blight and pipe that to head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. So, now we might want to know like how many of those are there. So, instead of piping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to head, we can pipe it to word count, which is wc. But despite the name, it doesn't only count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">words. If you pass in L for line, it'll do a line count. So, that's how many bacterial leaf blight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">images there are. So, it's really useful to play around with these things you can pipe into. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">head, wc, another useful one is tail, which is the last 10 lines. And then one we've seen before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is grep. So, not particularly useful, but show me all the ones with the number 33 in it. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can use head and tail also on files. So, head is very useful for csv files. If you're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">your Jupyter notebook and it's streaming at you, then it cannot read a csv file. It cannot parse a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">csv file. You can just jump into console or even from Jupyter notebook, just do head. Yeah. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">let's try it, right? Because so, I think we know that if you type cat and a file name, it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">send it to the output, which by default prints it to the screen. So, we could pipe that to head,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Now, real Unix gurus will say, well, that was silly because actually if you look at the band</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">page for head, if you pass it a file name, it does the same thing. But to me, I prefer to learn a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">small smaller number of composable things. So, piping stuff to head is not a bad idea. And we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">could even, and, you know, another nice thing about cat is I can pipe it into grep and search for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">everything with, I don't know, how many of these ADT45s are there? That's grep for ADT45 and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pipe that into word count but count lines. Yeah. So, you can quickly get some information at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">console, which, yeah, I think can be quite useful. All right. So, next thing to do, I reckon, is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">fire up a Jupyter. So, let's see the get Jupyter notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Excuse me, Jeremy, if you were interested in my paper space, Jupyter instances started up now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Hooray. So, I don't know if yours would have to. Look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Fantastic. All right. So, it's probably worth just quickly going through the exact same process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one more time, I guess, isn't it? So, we open up the terminal.

So, this is because I installed stuff to that Conda directory the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">other day. And so, if I go which pip, it's actually finding that one. And I don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there to be a pip there.

Okay, let's check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, we have an Unzip.

So, these are the issues. I mean, look, having said that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the average cost on paper space for storage, I believe, is $0.29 per gigabyte per month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, your convenience of putting it in storage is probably worth $0.29 for the one month.

So, maybe that's just a better plan. I do know, though, that the...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, maybe this is a problem, actually, because I do know the paper space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2284" target="_blank">00:38:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">/notebooks and /storage are very, very, very, very slow. And we can actually see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">when we're unzipping this. So, maybe this is a bad idea. Maybe we shouldn't put data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">at least when there's lots of fails. Because this is painful. I'm going to cancel it and see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how far it got.

It was nearly finished. But, yeah, I think this is actually slower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm going to remove that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have a strong feeling if we move it back to our home directory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be faster. I sure hope so. And the reason I care is not so much for the unzipping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">speed, but when it comes to training a model, we don't want it to be taking ages to open up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">each of those files. You see, even RM minus RF takes a long time. So, while that's running,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">let's move patty/zipfile, pop it into our home directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. And then cd to our home directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, that's now finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in terms of the steps we're going to do, it would be first we would make a directory for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2425" target="_blank">00:40:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We would then do the Kaggle download. Actually, which we can just copy easily enough from Kaggle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we would unzip. Let's see how long it takes. So, the time Unix command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">runs whatever command you put after it and tells you how long it took.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Did I not move it there? Oof.dot/patty. Oh, I didn't move it there. Yeah. Time, unzip, quietly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">patty. So, yeah. So, I think what I would do, now I think about it, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I would have a patty directory in my notebooks. I wouldn't store anything big here. I just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">my notebooks here. And I would put a script here called get data, say. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it will just have each of the steps I need. So, the steps would be cd to my home directory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">make the patty folder, cd to the patty folder, do the wget,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">or not wget, Kaggle competitions download, I should say, unzip it, patty disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2537" target="_blank">00:42:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And I think that's it, right? So, we can make that executable with chmodu+x to add the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">executable permission to it. And so, yeah. So, then all I have to do is run that thing each time I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">start up PaperSpace. And, yeah, it's only going to take eight seconds to unzip, and it took about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">five seconds to download. So, actually, that's not going to be really any trouble at all, is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. And that's, you know, /notebooks, remember, is persistent on this machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's all good. So, now we can create a notebook for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, my first step is always just to import computer vision functionality in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2603" target="_blank">00:43:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is the same thing we used yesterday. And now you know exactly what that does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then my second step is to look at the data. So, it's easiest to look at the data if we set a path</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to it. So, it's going to be in our home directory. And it's going to be called patty.plash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's okay. It's just /patty, right? It can go past that home. Wow. I didn't know that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's quite neat. Yeah, it is quite neat. So, that's that. Okay. So, we can path.ls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">tells me what's in there. And if you remember my trick from yesterday, I also like to set that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to be the path.basepath just so that my LSs look a bit easier to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. So, at this point, we could create a data frame by reading in the CSV of path/train.csv.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, we've got 10,000 rows. Each one is a JPEG. Each one's got a label. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">let's take a look at one of the images, shall we?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah, PIO image. Path/train/ actually, you know, let's make life a little bit easier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2748" target="_blank">00:45:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for ourselves by creating a train path. Because, you know, it's just so good to be lazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">/100330.jpg. Oh, no, because then they're inside the label directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. So, what we actually probably should have done would be to say turn path.ls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">patty_train, is that not right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">train_images. And that's another good reason to put it in a variable. So, you have to change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it in one place. And so, there we have that. And so, let's create, I don't know, let's call it the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bacterial_leaf_light_path=train_path/bacterial_leaf_light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2831" target="_blank">00:47:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now we should be able to go BLB and look at that image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, there we go. So, we have an image. Yay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So, might be nice to, like, find out a bit about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe look at the size. So, it's a 480 by 640 image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Great. You know, another way we can take a look at an image, you might remember from yesterday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2893" target="_blank">00:48:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can go files=get_image_files and pass in a path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And this will be recursive. So, I can do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">As you can see. So, this has got the 10,000. Okay. And that number there matches that number there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's a good sign. And so, another way to do that would have been to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">image=pil.create_files 0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And we could even take a look at a few, right? So, if we wanted to check that the image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">size seems reasonably consistent, we could go o.size for o in, well, actually, pil image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">dot create o dot size for o in files 10, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, this is not particularly rigorous, but it looks like they're generally 480 by 640</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">files. They're all the same size, which is handy. That's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're probably bigger than we normally need. You know, we normally use images that are about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">224 or so. Having said that, I don't know if, like, presumably this is some disease</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, paddy disease competition. So, it's rice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Classify the images according to their disease.

So, like, I would start by using smaller images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and kind of see how we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, 640 by 480 is not giant.

It's the type of rice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to the type of disease. Yeah. So, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3098" target="_blank">00:51:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the different diseases might look different depending on what type of rice it's on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">My guess is that we wouldn't need to use that information because given how many images there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3112" target="_blank">00:51:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are, I would guess that it's going to do a perfectly good job of recognizing the varieties</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3120" target="_blank">00:52:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">by itself without us telling it. Unless there's a whole lot of different types of varieties,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which we can check easily enough by checking the data frame, grabbing the variety,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and doing a .value counts.

So, look, I mean, there's a couple of tiny varieties, but on the whole,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">most of it is ADT 45 and quite a bit of Kanaka-Ponni. It does seem like a bit of a rice session today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't it? Lots of rice going on. Yeah. So, I think it's very unlikely that this variety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">field is going to help because there's so many examples of the main one anyway that it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to recognize it. I mean, at some point we can try it, but I would be making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that a pretty low priority for this competition. And so, yeah, given we're doing a practice walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3194" target="_blank">00:53:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">through, I'd be inclined to fire up Fastbook and the intro and see if we can just basically do the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">same thing that we did last time. So I'm going to merge these back together again. We've already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">got those, too. We've got those. Well, there's not much there, is there? Oh, I'm in APL mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder why things aren't working. I don't know how that happened. I haven't used APL today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3239" target="_blank">00:53:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Copy, paste. Okay. So this is how we did cats. So we needed a labeling function. Now, in our case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3250" target="_blank">00:54:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the labels are very easy. Each image is inside the directory, which is its label. So the parent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3257" target="_blank">00:54:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">folder name is the label. And so we already have a function to label from folders. So we can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just do image data loaders from folders, because that's all we need. So we're still going to need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the path. Train and valid actually have different names. So let's fill all of those in. So we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have path train equals train underscore, what was it? Images? Yep. And test images. Train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">underscore images. Valid percent. So that's fine. We'll do that the same as last time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's expecting to have train and valid subfolders. Oh, all valid percent. So hopefully that'll work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3328" target="_blank">00:55:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's try it. And we'll use the same resizes last time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Oh, no, that did. Well, did that work? No, it didn't work because we've got,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that's interesting. Test images. So my guess is it's got confused by the fact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3368" target="_blank">00:56:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Okay. So possibly what we should instead do is use train path here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And use valid percent instead. I wonder if that'll fix that problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. Let's fix that problem. Okay. Great. So we should then be able to create a learner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And learn dot fine-tune. Let's just do one epoch to start with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There it goes. So it can be useful to kind of make sure it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">being reasonably productive as it's training. And we can do that with nvidia smi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">nvidia smi minus help.

I think that's the one we want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">nvidia smi. daemon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. That's just finished. So while it was running, so this is something people often say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to use watch nvidia smi to like have it refresh. But actually I don't think most people know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3520" target="_blank">00:58:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a daemon subcommand where you can use that just as you can see it shows you every second how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going. And it's showing me the most important thing is this column SM. SM stands for symmetric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3532" target="_blank">00:58:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">multiprocessor. That's kind of what they call it instead of a CPU for their GPUs. And it's showing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3537" target="_blank">00:58:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">me that it's being used 70 to 90 percent kind of effectively if you like. And that's a good sign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3546" target="_blank">00:59:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fine. So if this was like under 50, then that would be a problem. But it looks like it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3553" target="_blank">00:59:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">using my GPU reasonably effectively. Yeah, and it's got the error rate down to 13 percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3560" target="_blank">00:59:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are successfully training a model. So that sounds good. So, Jeremy, just a quick question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're saying that like if it's under 50 percent, then that can be a problem. Is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because you've oversized the GPU like when you selected it or like just just want to clarify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3579" target="_blank">00:59:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what you know about that? What that would mean. Yeah, thanks. It's a good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3585" target="_blank">00:59:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Just rename this. It would probably mean that we're not able to read and process the images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">fast enough. And so in particular, my guess is that if they're in slash storage or slash notebooks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you would see the SM percent be really low because I think it would be taking a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">long time to open each image because it's coming from a network storage. And so generally, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a low SM means that your IO, your input output, your reading or processing time is too high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the ways to fix that would be a few. One would be to move the images onto the local machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3624" target="_blank">01:00:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so they're not on a network drive. A second would be to resize the images ahead of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to make them a more reasonable size. And a third would be to decrease the amount of kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3635" target="_blank">01:00:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">augmentation that you're doing. Or another would be to pick a different instance type with more CPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are basically the things. All right. Okay. Just to end the system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">my command also has a lot of useful information like your CUDA version and stuff like that. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it's also useful command even without demo to know that it exists. Yep. A lot of details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So if you're looking for the IDX of your GPU, it might be GPUs. And some of the variables</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here are a little bit more descriptive. So it might be easier to get started with that command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3682" target="_blank">01:01:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">or to at least use it every now and then. And if you'd like to have this one running in a loop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what I generally do, just do nvdr-smi-i. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I agree this is useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but I would suggest in a loop to use the daemon because there's only two columns you care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this one does not show you SM, right? So if you want to actually see it's being utilized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3708" target="_blank">01:01:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to use daemon. And you can also see the percentage memory utilization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So just look at these two columns. The other ones you can actually ignore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Okay. I think that's a pretty good place to stop. I'm glad you put us onto this competition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3725" target="_blank">01:02:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Radek. It looks fun. And I feel like we've got a reasonable start. So yeah, maybe next time we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">try doing a submission. And we could also try creating a Kaggle notebook for other people to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">see. How does that sound? Sounds excellent. One thing I also like about this is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we're coming up across problems as we go and jumping through those hoops. And these are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">beginner sorts of roadblocks that we'll have to face, I guess. Exactly. And if you guys, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3776" target="_blank">01:02:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">repeat these steps or do it on another dataset or whatever and hit some roadblocks, then it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3784" target="_blank">01:03:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">helpful. If you solve them, you know, come back tomorrow and tell us what happened and how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">solved it. And if you didn't, come back tomorrow and tell us to fix it for you. I think they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">both useful things to do. So things like Radek's example of like doing a bash environment variable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3800" target="_blank">01:03:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and having a space next to the equal sign, you know, that kind of stuff. I forget even to mention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3806" target="_blank">01:03:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it, but really useful information. You know, this competition is nice because it's relatively small,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like 10,000 images, and it's aligned with what you're doing in the course. But if you'd like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3817" target="_blank">01:03:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">try something out on a competition that is not active right now, you can still do this. Rascaggle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">allows you to do this late submission thing. And this opens up many competitions to play around with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3834" target="_blank">01:03:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The current competitions that are, how do they call it, ranked competitions, so they award you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">points and there are prizes, they are not on images. So we explore something on your own to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">try the methods on another competition on an image that might be something quite useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So to find those, you need to scroll to the bottom and click explore all competitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, this will let you see closed competitions as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can even see, I guess, here you go, you can find out which were the ones with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3884" target="_blank">01:04:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">most popular of all time.

Well, of course it would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cagqUrHMDJ0&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a bit sad, but there you go.
