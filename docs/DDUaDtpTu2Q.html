So if you're interested in the deep life, serious thinking needs to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a goal that you are pursuing. So here's what I want to do today is help you become a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">serious thinker, and I want to do that in a practical way. I have five different practices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Each of these are concrete that I want to run through. These are all things you can start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">doing right away in your own life that if you stick with them, you will find after a month,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your cognitive abilities are much better than they were before. After six months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the experience of your day-to-day life is going to be notably different and richer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and after a year or so, you're going to find yourself actually able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">produce ideas for yourself and the world that have real value. Really, you're going to unlock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">major options. So it's worth becoming a serious thinker. Let's go through five practices for how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to do it. I'm going to illustrate for those of you who are watching instead of just listening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">By popular demand, I will illustrate what we're doing here. So on the screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to put in the center my world-famous picture of a brain. So what we got here is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cerebellum, and we got some wrinkles and folds in the brain. So I have a brain in the center,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm going to illustrate around this. I'll put one expertly drawn icon per practice we are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to discuss. All right. So the first practice that I want to discuss is to improve the quality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and decrease the quantity of information that you consume.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So to illustrate this with an icon, I'm going to expertly draw here the Twitter T. I know they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">switched to X, but I sort of am boycotting that. So I'm drawing a T, and I'm putting a circle with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a line through it. I'm going to indicate consuming better quality and less quantity of information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does this mean? I'm talking particularly here about news or other information you use to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">learn more things about the world. Stop using social media algorithms to curate your news flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Social media algorithms are bad curators. Their interest is not making you as informed as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">possible. Their interest is making you as engaged as possible to make you as engaged as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They are going to push you to places that are not emotionally healthy. It's also not going to lead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you to the most nuanced understanding of issues. I want you instead to focus on a multi-scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">news and information consumption. So I want your news and information consumption to be divided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">over three scales, daily, monthly, and seasonal. And here's what I mean by that. Daily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have a very small number, probably just one sources of quality, non-algorithmically curated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">news and information. This could be one of the growing number of daily news roundup newsletters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I like, for example, if you're a subscriber to the New York Times, I think David Leonhardt's daily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">news summary is a fantastic one. I'm saying this mainly because they featured my profile from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">New York Times Magazine from last year. They re-featured it recently in that newsletter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we know that's expertly curated. It could be a daily news roundup podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be a physical newspaper that you pick up or have delivered. Okay. At the monthly scale,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you spend the time to go through a collection of, let's say, two to six</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in-depth long-form magazine articles. So now this is still relatively current,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but not day-to-day current. This is now information where enough time has passed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for a professional journalist or writer to actually spend some time to really digest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">information about what's going on in the world and produce and have edited a long-form piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we're at a lag of a month or so from what's actually going on. This is where, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can pull out a few selected articles from my own journalistic home, which is the New Yorker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you pull out some long-form articles from the Atlantic or Foreign Affairs or the National</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Review or the Wall Street Journal's Sunday issue. Whatever it is that you particularly follow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">could be print, could be not print, tablet magazine. I'm just thinking of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things I've pulled from before. And you're like, "Here's my six articles I've gathered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout the month, 3,000, 5,000 word beast. I'm going to go to a coffee shop somewhere. I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">got these printed out."

The idea here is when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you're at your home or your apartment or wherever you live, you keep your phone plugged in in one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">place.

High-stake things are just anxiety-producing. And you have to figure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is this worth the anxiety?

There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">information in books that's relevant to your life.

Simple marks in the margins. I might, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">put a little box. Let's see here. I might put a little bit of a box around text that's important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or I might just put a little bit of a check mark next to a line, or I might put a curly brace next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to a paragraph that I want to remember. Just small marks in the margins to indicate what lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are important.

So the low friction here is important because it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">prevent you from reading. In other words, if the effort required to read, you're just there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2927" target="_blank">00:48:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of what you have available, corner marking note-taking barely changes that effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back.

The bonus here is that every time you come across something new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for one of these projects, I come across a link that's relevant for an article.

Earlier this year, I switched over to a Remarkable. So it's a digital notebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which I really love.

We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3342" target="_blank">00:55:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">did a whole thing about it on the show. Uh, but whatever the point is, it's cool and aspirational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3347" target="_blank">00:55:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, it's interesting. That's where you have your cool notebook for keeping track of ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about your life. And all you need there is some sort of semi-regular process of reading through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">these. The very simplest thing you can do if you're using a physical notebook is when you fill it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">put aside an hour to review it, and to only copy into your new notebook, short summaries of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3371" target="_blank">00:56:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">most important or lasting ideas from your previous notebook. So there's a very natural triage you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">do that way. See what sticks, uh, and what you lose interest in over time. So that's my approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3386" target="_blank">00:56:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It is low friction. It is simple. Very little custom software is required. One cool notebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3393" target="_blank">00:56:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and whatever else you're already using for your work, but because you're adding very little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">friction, you can keep up and the stuff that matters will get captured and put to the place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">where it matters. And then of course you get all the bonuses. So again, for books, the bonus is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">having to remember which book had, what is a feature, not a bug. It allows you to continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to work with and build on these ideas after you first encounter them. When it comes to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3417" target="_blank">00:56:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">projects, having your notes where you want to actually do the work is not just efficient,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but it allows you to re-encounter the gestalt of what you know about that project again and again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as you grow those notes, allowing your mind to work more with it. And cool notebooks put you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">into that mindset of a cultivator or crafter of your own life. So we're sort of hacking the brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">here.

It's not as exciting as other systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3452" target="_blank">00:57:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Some other systems, people actually make this clear disclaimer, like building systems and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUaDtpTu2Q&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">fine.
