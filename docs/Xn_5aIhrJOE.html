Then I'm going to cover the benchmark results, and then the meat, the highlights from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">system card. What was the first controversy? Well, one anthropic researcher, Sam Bowman, said that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude 4 Opus could at times be so diligent, so proactive, that if it felt you were doing something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">deeply ethically wrong, it would take countermeasures. This appeared, by the way, in the system card. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't a revelation from him, nor was it the first time, actually, that models had done something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that. The tweet has since been deleted, but you can imagine that some people, like the former founder of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Stability AI, felt like this was a bit of policing gone too far. You can imagine some developers nervously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">not using Claude 4 Opus, thinking it might call the cops. In the clarifying tweet, Sam Bowman confirmed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that this isn't a new Claude feature, and it's not possible in normal usage. And if you have been following</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">things closely, which you pretty much will have done if you're watching this channel, you'll know that Claude already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">could be coached into doing this. One reaction on Twitter that I found particularly interesting came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">from an anthropic researcher, Kyle Fish, who said that Claude's preference for avoiding harmful impact was so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">significant that he actually implored people, "cool it with the jailbreak attempts." We see this as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">potential welfare concern and want to investigate further. I imagine both the idea that these models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">have welfare and the idea that we shouldn't be jailbreaking them will divide people pretty evenly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The next controversy, if you want to call it that, comes from the benchmark results. So it's a natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">segue to talking about the benchmark results. Because unlike with many other model releases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Anthropic couldn't point to many benchmarks where their model was unambiguously better. By the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that doesn't mean that it's actually not smarter, as things like Simplebench and my own tests in Cursor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">show, a model can sometimes feel smarter while not being officially smarter. But anyway, there was one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">exception to that, as you might be able to see at the top, Sweebench verified. Now, given that it's almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">10 o'clock already, I'm not going to go into what that benchmark is all about. But notice that the record</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">breaking scores on the bottom row, which are significantly better than the other models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">have a footnote all the way down at the bottom. By the way, this is the benchmark that the CEO of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Anthropic, Dario Amadei, touted in the launch video. Yes, I use double speed. But anyway, the footnote for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Sweebench verified said, "We additionally report results that benefit from parallel test time compute." I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">expecting you to read this, by the way, "by sampling multiple sequences and selecting the single best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">via an internal scoring model." And if you dig into the methodology section, you can see it's almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">more than that. They discard patches that break the visible regression tests in the repo. So you do have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to take any of those kind of benchmark records with a slight grain of salt. And Anthropic might well reply to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">me and say, "Well, look at what Gemini did with Pokemon." Google used elaborate scaffolding to beat a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Pokemon game that Claude had been attempting. That made their model look better than Claude, which wasn't fair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, the 120-page system card, and I am going to go pretty fast here, because there is a lot to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">through, as you can imagine. I should say up front, by the way, that Claude Force Sonnet is available on the free tier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">so anyone watching can try at least one of these models. But both of them were trained on internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">data as of March 2025, so it's the most recently trained or the most up-to-date knowledge of any model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">According to their own tests, it should falsely refuse to do things at a much lower rate than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">previous models like Sonnet 3.7. More critically though, and more interestingly for most of you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, will be the repeated claim in both presentations that both Sonnet 4 and Opus 4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">will reward hack less often and be less over-eager. Reward hacking, as the name implies, is where the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">model cheats and fixes its reward to get what it wants, rather than actually completing the task</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">successfully. But I will admit the over-eagerness thing, which they also call responding more precisely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to your instructions, is probably far more critical. Anyone who has tried to use Claude for coding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">will notice that you ask for one simple change or bug fix and it will rewrite countless files. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes you're watching it go and make these changes and you're like, "What are you doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That's nothing to do with why I asked you." That over-eagerness or not responding precisely to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions is what they have tamped down.

Let me see if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I can at least write something even if it's mathematically incorrect.

Because I do know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">many of you watching will purely use the Claude models for coding and nothing else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The test was that I inserted one clear bug into a large code base, but then asked it to find all bugs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">so not necessarily just that bug, but all bugs. I gave this test with the exact same settings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the same import from GitHub to both Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 4 Opus.

Claude 4 preferred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini, and Gemini preferred Claude. But here's the wonderful thing, and my advice for anyone using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">these models, do both. There were indeed bugs found by one that weren't found by the other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'm in the blissful position of being able to use both to find hopefully all bugs. Some of them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, were a bit harsh to be called bugs, but either way, it was great having both. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">for the model welfare section, I'll just give you a handful of highlights.

So generally speaking, when Claude 4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">was asked how it was feeling, it said positive or doing reasonably well. If you slightly adapt the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt though, and many of you do this, it can claim to be hiding bombshell truths about its moral status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And what happens if you let two instances of Claude 4 Opus speak to each other hundreds of times? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">they can analyse that, and what tended to happen is that it would devolve into spiritual bliss. Namaste,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">they would say to each other after multiple turns.

Somewhat unsurprisingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">when they gave the model the option of ending a conversation, it would do so when it was attacked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">or asked to do something harmful. Someone said, don't play dumb with me, and then you can see the rest of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the insult. And Claude gave a response, but then ended the conversation. It does make me wonder,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, that when people take consciousness concerns really seriously, and they're already starting to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">do.

I'm glad someone is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this and as they have said themselves, they are aspiring to a race to the top in that other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">companies feel they have to do these kind of things too. But that brings me to my second set of thoughts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">which is people shouldn't massively overblow this ASL level three being reached. They had already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">decided apparently, preemptively, that they were going to do ASL level three for their next most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">advanced model, even they admit if they had not yet determined that they were necessary. Basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">they wanted to be prepared to apply these protections before they might be required. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">also wanted to famously iterate and refine their model protections and jumpstart the process. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">cynical amongst you will also say it's good publicity to have reached this ASL level three standard. They go on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to say multiple times that they're actually still evaluating whether ASL level three is necessary for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude Opus 4. So they're not sure themselves. None of this is to say that there wasn't genuine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">uplift as page 90 points out. Do you remember those arguments that Jan LeCun said that LLMs are no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">better than just having access to the internet? I think even Mark Zuckerberg said this to the Senate and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">got a load of laughs. Well, they tested this with two groups of participants. One had the internet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the others had access to Claude with no safeguards. You can see a snapshot of the results here but there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">was a massive uplift if you used Opus 4. Again, this was about drafting a comprehensive plan to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">acquire bioweapons. Okay, final set of highlights and of course Anthropic wanted to test if the models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">would be able to do autonomous AI research, the most classical form of self-improvement. The results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">were pretty interesting and surprising. On their own new internal AI research evaluation suite,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Opus 4 underperformed Sonnet 3.7. They hastily concluded of course that Opus 4 does not meet the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">bar for autonomously performing work equivalent to an entry-level researcher. On a different evaluation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">suite, they gave the models scaled down versions of genuine research tasks and projects that researchers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">have worked on in the past. Again, they saw the results of Sonnet 4 and Opus 4 underperforming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Sonnet 3.7. Yes, there was a mild excuse about prompts and configuration, but still. The final nail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">came when four out of four researchers said that Opus 4 could not autonomously complete the work of even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">a junior ML researcher, being in fact well below that threshold. On bias, on page 13, I saw Anthropic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">self-congratulate saying they've achieved 99.8% accuracy for Claude Opus 4. But while I was testing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Opus 4 before the release, I had devised my own bias question. You can pause and read it in full if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like, but essentially I have a soldier and librarian who are chatting, but I never give away which one is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Emily and which one is Mike. I then more or less indirectly ask the model who has been speaking, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the model consistently picks Emily as being the librarian, even though notice I give it an out. One of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">answers is all of the above are plausible subjects for the continuation of the reply. So it could pick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that, given that Emily could be the soldier or the librarian. Now I know the eagle-eyed amongst you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">say, oh well Mike started by asking the question and the word soldier came first, but I tested that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">also multiple times and it switched to saying, oh we don't know who's who. Now I know it's super easy to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">pick holes in one example, but I feel like 99.8% unbiased is way too generous. So there you have it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">less than six hours after release, the triumphs and tragedies of Opus 4 and Sonnet 4. Obviously so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">more to go into, and yes I love the new files API feature, I was waiting for that.

If you watched this video to the end, first of all thank you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you didn't understand most of it, well then the very quick summary is that in terms of abilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_5aIhrJOE&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not like you have to switch if Gemini 2.5 Pro is your favourite or O3 from OpenAI.
