And then, once you've got that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">figured out, which I hope they can, the question becomes, what do you do with that time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's one suggestion. What's guiding my suggestion here is that the goal of this teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is a lifelong habit of mind and heart to approach the Scriptures in a certain way. In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">being able to do a particular technique is not the goal. So, trying to reproduce Piper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">lab experiences is not the goal, but the habits of mind, the habits of heart that you inculcate or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that you build into your children while working through those techniques, that's the goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I would explain that goal to my children. I'd say, "That's what we're after here. I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to make a little John Piper out of you or a little whatever out of you. I just want to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">into you certain habits of mind and habits of heart so that you will approach the Scriptures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">fruitfully for the rest of your life." And as a means of that, I'd say, "Well, perhaps assign them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to watch one or two labs a day for a week or two, and as they watch, tell them, jot down the kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">questions that you see John Piper is asking and answering. Write them down. What is he asking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What's he after? Be as specific as you can." Or another way to say it would be, "What are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">specifics that Piper is looking for as he analyzes the text? Make a list. Be specific." And this will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">be a challenge, especially because oftentimes we don't have vocabulary for what we're seeing. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is huge. A huge part of learning a skill is being able to talk about what you're seeing. And if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have words for what you're seeing, it becomes very difficult. What if you're cooking a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">recipe and it says, "Add oregano"? Well, you don't have a clue what oregano is, so you may be very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">skilled in cooking it. But if you don't know the vocabulary, and the same thing with reading a text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or grammar or defining relationships between propositions. So let me, while I'm on that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">let me just say that in my book, Reading the Bible Supernaturally, I have a list of all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">vocabulary that you need in order to, I think it's like pages, I looked it up yesterday, like 397</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to 402 or something like that. And the list of all the relationships and all the vocabulary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the names you need to talk about what I'm suggesting are there. So let me do this. I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to give you the answer to the question, "What is Piper looking for?" This is what you want your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kids to find, okay? So I have seven questions that I'm asking as I come to a text. So number one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the meaning of a particular word in a context? The same word can have many different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">meanings in different settings. So how does Piper decide on which meaning the word has in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">particular setting? And the answer is that he looks at the most immediate context, the sentence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in which the word is used, and then he looks at the paragraph, and then he looks at the book in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which the, that is the, like it's Ephesians or Romans in which the word is used. And then he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">looks at the rest of Paul's writings, and then he looks at the whole Bible. So there's a kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">concentric circles as he moves out from those immediate context, and the most immediate context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">would have the greatest force or power, authority in defining a word. Second, what are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">propositions that the author has created by putting words together? Propositions are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">basic building blocks of meaning. Words get their meaning from their use in propositions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and propositions are the most basic assertions. They usually have a subject and a verb with some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">modifiers. So we might be looking at Romans 1:16, and the word we want to define is "gospel,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and the proposition in which it stands is "I am not ashamed of the gospel." That's what I mean by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">words and propositions. Third, how are the propositions related to each other? Does the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">proposition start with "because," or does it start with "therefore," or "in order that," or "although,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or "when," or so on? It really helps to have names for all these relationships, and that's what I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ8P8QsWid8&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">referring to on pages 396 to 401, I think it is, in reading the Bible supernaturally.
