Anush Dsouza, the Product Manager, states Heroku wants to make it “simple to attach agents and AI to your application.”<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRFqbEzzDsI&t=301">5:1</a> Agentic Control Loop: Heroku provides an "agentic control loop" running on its platform. This loop gives AI models access to tools like code execution and data access, all secured under Heroku's trust layer.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRFqbEzzDsI&t=385">6:25</a> AI Primitives: Heroku AI is built on key primitives. These include inference for accessing curated models, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for extending app functionality, and PG Vector for handling embeddings.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRFqbEzzDsI&t=428">7:8</a> Trusted Compute: Heroku's trusted compute layer, Dynos, runs first-party tools. They plan to expand this with tools for web search and memory, and users can bring their own tools via MCP.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRFqbEzzDsI&t=803">13:23</a> Managed Inference: This service allows you to run AI models directly within your Heroku infrastructure. This keeps your data within your application's network for enhanced security.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRFqbEzzDsI&t=878">14:38</a> Supported Models: The platform supports text-to-text models from Anthropic (Claude 3.5, 3.7, and 4), embeddings from Cohere Embed, and image generation with Stable Image Ultra.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRFqbEzzDsI&t=3051">50:51</a> Chat Completions API: The basic chat completions endpoint is designed to be highly compatible with the OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. The presenter notes it's “95% compatible with the OpenAI API,” allowing the use of the OpenAI SDK..It supports standard parameters like temperature and max_tokens, as well as streaming responses.
