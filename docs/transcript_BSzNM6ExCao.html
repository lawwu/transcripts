Too long. There's like the shortification of everything, right? It used to be we watched movies, then we watched TV shows that are 30 minutes. And now we watch YouTube videos that are 10 minutes.</p><p>And now we watch YouTube shorts that are 30 seconds long, right? And contrary to what most people say, they're like, we don't have the attention span. It's like if you took TikTok to someone in the 1800s, they would still watch it, right? It's not the human attention span that got shorter.</p><p>It's just that we are better at telling stories quicker. I don't need 400 pages to explain to you how to cook an egg. I could probably do it in 20 seconds. Similarly, I think some people take way too long to get to the damn point. Even like an Instagram post, it's like a picture and like a paragraph of text is about as much as you need to explain a lot of different concepts.</p><p>So the shortification of everything, can you say all of this stuff in one page or even one paragraph rather than 10? That's so much better.</p></div></div></body></html>
