How does someone even begin to put together a plan for finding scholarship and Merit Aid? You go to tamingthehighcostofcollege.com/scholarships. I have the scholarship guide for busy parents and I'm just launching it this week. But the goal of it is so you can learn enough to know about what types of scholarships are right fit for you.</p><p>I mean, I had a family fill out 41 scholarship applications and they won seven for $39,000, but they're the exception. They're not the rule, right? And if you're going to work that hard at it, you need to know what you're getting into. And that's the reality, right? Is families that should work that hard at it, because they could be successful, run out of time because they don't start early enough and therefore they don't do the 40 applications.</p><p>They do six or five or zero. And then other times families, students are busy, parents are busy. Somebody has to do all the hard work for scholarships, and it could be worth it.</p></div></div></body></html>
