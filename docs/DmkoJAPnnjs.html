When EF Hutton talks, people listen. That was their motto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a very classy firm.

side of the economy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and there was another fellow who focused on the real side, on the GDP side of the economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">From there, you started to create quite a name for yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

early on is I put a lot of financial reporters on my distribution list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I produced a monthly at first, then a weekly, and subsequently I went for a daily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and answer my own

target="_blank">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess that kind of open communication with the financial media helped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other part is I do write a lot and comment on issues that everybody is concerned about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My job is to help institutional

target="_blank">00:08:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the Fed was created in late 1913.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was created mostly because there was a concern that we just kept having these financial crises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The previous crisis occurred in 1907, and J.P. Morgan, the famous banker,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stepped in and managed to calm things down in the financial markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was, in a sense, the Fed at the time. He was the power in the financial markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was a sense that we were getting too many of these financial disruptions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and creating too much havoc in the economy, and that the money supply just wasn't elastic enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't responding to the cyclical needs of the economy for farming, for example, commerce, international trade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so some politicians and Wall Street types got together and started to map out a central bank for the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the late 1913, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act, which created the Fed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Back then, the key mandate was to provide a currency that accommodated the needs of the economy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but in the context of what happened in 1907, but to avoid financial instability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In our conversation, we'll see how that mandate has changed into something completely different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and how that may have kind of led to some of the issues that confront us today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Act kind of left things in the hands of 12 regional banks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These regional Fed banks are essentially owned through stock ownership by other banks, by private sector banks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a quasi-private and governmental organization, but it clearly is very much a regulatory agent in our economy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">responsible for regulating the banks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it also has become very important in managing the monetary system, the financial system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, most of the power originally rested with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under Benjamin Strong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who was the president of that bank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was a financial conservative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He believed in the gold standard, and he did a pretty good job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, he passed away in the late '20s just before the Great Recession hit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Feds just did a horrible job during the Great Depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a result, in 1933, the Federal Reserve Act was amended to create the Federal Open Market Committee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which includes the governors of the Federal Reserve Board</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the regional presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks around the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the power shifted away from New York to Washington, D.C.,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that kind of created a new version of the Fed, much more powerful than it had been before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">much more centralized and located in Washington rather than New York.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it really became part of the Washington government and became a little less beholden to the financial system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which was epicentered in New York City.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so after that change, we did start to see that the FOMC became much more important in our economy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but that really didn't occur until after World War II. With World War II, what happened, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is we wanted to win the war, as we all do in those kind of situations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Fed basically provided very low interest rates to the Treasury to borrow money to finance the war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the early '50s, the Treasury and the Fed came up with an agreement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where the Fed basically got its power that it has today to manage monetary policy independently of the Treasury</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and other government pressures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So since the early '50s, the Fed's been running monetary policy more or less independently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's been a lot of criticism that sometimes that's not quite the case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but for all practical purposes, the Fed determines interest rates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">determines the amount of reserves that banks have in the monetary system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of a really brief overview of where the Fed originated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what its original mandate was, and how it evolved until today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I should just mention that in the late '70s, its mandate changed to a dual mandate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is to focus on keeping unemployment as low as possible and to keep price inflation extremely low as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we went from an originally promise of financial stability to managing the business cycle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think that created a lot of problems that have come to haunt us to this very day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What I found interesting when you gave the history of the first Federal Reserve presidents prior to Arthur Burns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was a lot of them were business tycoons.

up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and when that happened, we'd have

target="_blank">00:28:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he was willing to accept that, whereas Alan Greenspan comes in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it just seems like I guess the only thing left is for the Fed to just outright go and buy stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's the thing, is we started out with Alan Greenspan being very laissez-faire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as long as the stock market was going up, but then when it took a dive in 1987 and then in 2000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he was clearly willing

| <span class="t">But under Greenspan, it was really all focused on interest rates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and for the benefit of hindsight, it seems like he kept interest rates way too long in 2000 through 2006.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He left in January 2006, so really at the end of 2005, interest rates were kept low for too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When he started raising them, he raised them in a very predictable fashion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1827"

check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the result, I think, was creating the housing bubble, the credit derivatives calamity that befell us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's what Ben Bernanke inherited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Bernanke realized he was having a problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:31:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but by 2008, it became very apparent that things were falling apart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I think Bernanke's big mistake was allowing Lehman to fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, they could have

day, came up with bringing interest rates down to zero,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.000</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, Janet Yellen came in on February 2014, and she was committed to keeping all this stimulus in the system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkoJAPnnjs&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but she
