It might make you richer, but I'm not sure it's gonna make you happier at all.</p><p>So let's quantify how much richer you can get if you sleep less and be more productive with your time. So let's say the average person wakes up at 7 a.m. to start their day and goes to bed at 11 p.m. You decide to wake up at 5.30 a.m. and work for one hour every day for a year because that's what some productivity guru told you to do.</p><p>You go to bed at the same time, so how much richer will you be in a year? Well, just calculate your hourly wage. What are you worth per hour? 10 bucks, 50 bucks? Let's say you're worth 100 bucks an hour. You will be $36,500 richer than the average person over a year.</p><p>Assuming the hourly rate and bedtime stays the same, over a 10-year period, you will be worth 365,000 more than the average person, assuming no growth rate either. Now, if you slap on a 7% compound annual return during this time period, you're gonna be worth 540,000 more than the average person.</p><p>And then you multiply this by several decades, and well, frankly, you're gonna be millions of dollars richer than the average person who sleeps in, watches TV all day, and twiddles his or her thumbs playing video games. You know, I'm always, always amazed every time I'm on the bus or on the subway or on the plane or in the lounge, people are just always on their phones, glued to their phones.</p><p>If you haven't checked your hourly usage rate for your phone yet, check it out. It's probably in the four to eight hour a day range. And that's a lot, especially if you're just consuming information and not producing information. I wanna challenge you guys to start producing things instead of consuming things.</p><p>That's like a 180 degree difference that will really add up and build your wealth over time if you can get that going. So if you wanna get rich or richer than average, it's pretty simple, just work more. I've got this pretty popular post called, are there really people who work 40 hours a week or less and then complain why they can't get ahead?</p><p>I know it really kinda pisses people off, but it's just math. You don't have to be smarter. You just have to wake up a little bit earlier and do a little bit more work and compound that productivity over many, many years and really good things are gonna happen. Unfortunately, I don't think working more and being richer will necessarily make you happier.</p><p>Instead, I think there's a great argument to be made that those who work less and can afford the luxury of regularly sleeping in in a continuous fashion have a much better life. So let me explain with my own situation. From 1999 to 2012, the average time I got up was 5 a.m.</p><p>I got up at 5 a.m. not because I wanted to, but because I had to for work. If I didn't get into work by 5.30 a.m., I would've just been fired. And also, the stock market opened at 9.30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time and 6.30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time and I had to do a bunch of research preparation and reading and distributing and coffee running and just being a gopher during my first two years in finance.</p><p>So that was that. I remember in college, I dropped a class, an 8 a.m. class because it was just way too early. So just think about trying to wake up at 5 a.m. to go to work at 5.30. That was kind of brutal, especially since I had to stay until about 7.30 p.m.</p><p>every day. Once I left my banking job, I thought I'd start sleeping in way more, but not the case at all. After 13 years, my body was already conditioned like Pavlov's dog and I continued to wake up at 5 a.m. until about mid-2017. So if I went to bed at 11 p.m., I'd wake up at 5 a.m.</p><p>If I went to bed at 12 midnight, I would wake up at 5 a.m. and I'd wake up at 5 a.m. if I went to bed at 1 a.m. It was just kind of the darnedest thing. But in mid-2017, everything changed because our son was born and as any parent or new parent knows, sleep gets severely disrupted, right?</p><p>Every two hours, you're feeding and the baby's crying for whatever reason and parents gotta attend or else. After about three months, thank God my wife decided to take over night duties to allow me to write and also to record podcasts because there's no way to write and record a podcast other than in absolute silence.</p><p>So something else started happening in early 2018. After regularly going to bed at around 11.30 p.m., I found myself waking up by 4 a.m. on average. When I was waking up in the pitch black every morning, I always guessed the time, thinking, hoping there would be a five handle, maybe a six handle sometimes, but nope, those handles never came.</p><p>It was always around 4 a.m. that I'd wake up in the middle of the pitch black morning. Often, I'd look out into the ocean to find comfort that a lone fisherman or maybe two had started his day even earlier. So let me share what's going on with me and why I'm now waking up an hour earlier than my already early morning.</p><p>I'm not doing this on purpose, folks, because I don't set my alarm clock. I'm doing so naturally out of circumstance and necessity. So here's some reasons. One, anxiety and excitement have increased. For a while, I was scheduling posts for publication at 2.30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, and I did this because I like to wake up at around 5 a.m.</p><p>after the post had marinated in the public for several hours. So it allowed people like yourself to read it, comment, and it was always fun. It felt like Christmas morning every morning. But the problem is, the more I wrote, the more anxiety and excitement I had. And so when I regularly started posting three times a week plus a newsletter, so the newsletter edition every week, it was an edition, my anxiety and excitement went up about 33%, right, going from three to four.</p><p>And then now that I'm doing these podcasts regularly, I've also got on my mind, hey, what should I talk about, how should I write, how are the podcasts gonna perform, and so forth. So it does feel like Christmas morning as a kid every morning, which is a great feeling.</p><p>However, some days I have a feeling of dread, like waiting in the lobby of the principal's office. And I know that feeling quite well because I went to the principal's office so many times in elementary school, middle school, and high school. I was in trouble all the time, whether it was due to fighting or being an insubordinate student, and just other stuff.</p><p>So the more I produced, the more opinions that I gave, the more things that I've done, the less I slept because, hey, I wanted to see how the world would react. It's just like working on something for a very, very long time, and then going live with that project at work or something.</p><p>There's just a lot of anticipation and anxiety that goes through these things. And so as a creator, you're always just kind of wondering how will the public react. All right, another reason why I'm waking up earlier, I think it's because I'm simply getting older. They say you don't need as much sleep as you get older, and I say they're absolutely right.</p><p>Older people wake up more often because they spend less time in a deep sleep. Other causes include needing to get up and urinate, that's called nocturia, anxiety and discomfort, or pain from long-term chronic illnesses. Thankfully, I don't have any of that. I find I need to go to the bathroom like once a night now.</p><p>And I remember my buddy telling me at 50 years old, just wait until you get to 50, you'll see how many times you have to go to the bathroom every night. And he's true. Even though I try not to drink at least an hour before I go to bed, I often still find myself getting up to go to the bathroom.</p><p>Three, regular afternoon siestas. Napping can ruin evening sleep, but I just can't help myself for taking a siesta after lunch about 95% of the time. It just feels like part of your natural rhythm. And I think it is your natural rhythm. At around one o'clock, people get sleepy, that's why people go get coffee to force themselves awake.</p><p>Well, because I don't have anywhere to go and I don't have a job, I just go the path of least resistance and take a nap. And these naps can last between 15 minutes to sometimes an hour and a half, which I think probably really wrecks nighttime sleep. Being able to nap every day is a great example of how an easy life can ruin your work ethic.</p><p>This is why being a solopreneur, working from home, just doing your own thing is really hard because you have to be very disciplined. You've got to follow your own schedule because nobody's going to tell you what to do. It's kind of like, well, I would say being able to nap is kind of like having your parents buy you a house and maybe a Mercedes Benz after graduation.</p><p>You know, if you got the house and the car, I mean, why bother working late at work, building relationships, trying hard at all? You'd probably just kick back and relax like my neighbor's son, who's 29 years old this year, and probably going to stay at home for the rest of his life.</p><p>So if you've ever seen the movie "Da Vinci Code" and the guy Silas, and he whips himself in the back, well, I feel kind of like him, where I'm whipping myself to do some work and to not slack off too much and take my luck for granted. Four, this is a really important one.</p><p>The pressure to provide has increased. None of us work. My wife stays at home and does a great job being a mom. I stay at home and I try to be a stay-at-home dad. We don't have the security of day jobs. And when we didn't have children, well, that was okay because, well, there was the passive income and then also the severance packages that we had.</p><p>But when you have a kid, I don't know, something changes inside you. It's like we're wired to provide no matter how much we have or no matter how many times we run the numbers. With the increased pressure to provide for a family, I've also become more sensitive about investment swings.</p><p>So during the fourth quarter of 2018, I gotta admit, I was pretty stressed. I think my portfolio was down probably around $500,000 at the low point, even though it's a pretty conservative portfolio. So I don't really care how much you have. That absolute dollar figure, if it's way more than what you spend a year, is gonna feel painful.</p><p>It's gonna hurt and it's gonna feel a little scary. So just know this for folks who are on the path to financial independence or who have retired. Be conservative with your portfolio. If you already won the game, you can look out for a two to 5% rate of return.</p><p>I think that's great because you're beating inflation by a little bit and you're probably not gonna have as much volatility. You don't want to have that volatility once you've retired or left your job because that feeling is not worth it. You wanna be retired and have peace of mind, folks, because it's just two step forwards, one step back if you're just worried about your money and you're thinking, well, maybe I need to get a part-time job or maybe I need to find a full-time job.</p><p>You don't wanna feel that way once you've decided to retire. And then the final reason why I don't think I can sleep that long is because my friend died young. I was 13 years old and in Malaysia while this happened. He was driving a little too fast after going to the nightclub with another friend and then he spun out, hit a tree, and he and a passenger died.</p><p>And it was really traumatic because I didn't know he died. What happened was I went to Taiwan for some summer activity. I came back and I called his house and his mom picked up and I asked her, hey, is Mark available to talk or to play? And she told me, and I'll never forget it, Mark died last week.</p><p>Think about how traumatizing that is for a 13-year-old to listen to a mother say that her son passed away. And all I could do was say sorry and hang up and just wrestle with my mind on what the hell just happened. I couldn't understand it. But now as an adult, I feel there's just no way I can slack off and sleep in because my friend never got a chance.</p><p>If he had, he would have done amazing things for this world. Every time I feel like slacking off, I think about him or the time when I was swarmed by beggars in Agra or in Penang, Malaysia. I think about my neighbor's daughter who has severe cerebral palsy and she's confined to a wheelchair and she can't speak.</p><p>And it just is so heartbreaking and it makes me angry. It makes me angry that some people don't have the chance to do what they want and it makes me angry that children, children are being taken away from their parents for no good reason. So my mind is constantly being reminded of these people who don't have the same opportunities I have.</p><p>And to not give 100% would be like insulting them all because I know they would give 110% if they were me. If you conquer the morning, I believe you will conquer the day. Getting one important thing done before the day starts is like paying yourself first. No matter what happens during the day, at least you did something productive.</p><p>No matter how much you spend during the day, at least you saved some money. Being able to function regularly on just five to six hours of sleep a day is both a blessing and a curse. I'm definitely able to get a lot more done without having to be any smarter than average.</p><p>However, sometimes I sure would love to be able to sleep in and sleep seven to nine hours continuously. When I hear my friends sleeping in, I'm jealous. I'd love to sleep in because I would say one out of three times I dream. And my dreams are amazing. They're of flying, they're of seeing new places, they're of doing a lot of fun activities.</p><p>I just love it. So if you're able to sleep in every day, I think you should feel blessed. It may mean that you are not suffering the same amount of guilt or anxiety or pressure as many other early risers do. There's no need to get up early, frankly. There's also a good chance you may also feel more financially secure because of your own doing or because someone is providing for you.</p><p>And if someone is providing for you, don't forget to say thank you and give him or her a lot of love, attention, and respect. If you have no financial worries, your mind will surely allow you to relax more often. What a blessing I think it is to be so carefree.</p><p>And listen, I know not everybody requires eight or nine hours of sleep. Some require five or six. Everybody has a different chronotype, they say. The average sleep duration in the population is between seven to eight hours. Only about 2% or 3% require five hours of sleep or six hours of sleep.</p><p>So you might be a part of that minority population that only needs five to six hours of sleep. Maybe, maybe not. But if you're looking to get more sleep, I've done a lot of research, I've read a lot of books, and these are some tips that will help you sleep better.</p><p>One, a light bedtime snack may be helpful. Many people find that warm milk increases sleepiness because it contains a natural sedative like amino acid. Just make sure you're not lactose intolerant like I am. Avoid stimulants such as caffeine three to four hours before bed. Don't take naps like I do.</p><p>Exercise moderately in the afternoon. Oh man, when I play tennis or softball, I can nap really well or sleep really well. But it's still only five to six hours of sleep. Avoid too much stimulation such as violent TV shows and horror flicks and computer games before sleep. You know, we've got a little boy and we try to cut off his TV, iPad time an hour before he goes to sleep.</p><p>And try to calm down and not, you know, hustle and bustle and tumble and rumble like I do with him all the time. Don't drink lots of water within two hours of going to bed. Try to go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time each morning.</p><p>Try to use the bed only for sleep and sex, not for work. I used to work in my bed for hours and hours. I would just prop myself up on the headrest and just go to town. Now I get up and go to a home office and work at a table like I'm recording right now.</p><p>Avoid tobacco products, especially before bedtime. Try to get a blue light screen for your computer and your iPad and your iPhone. Don't use your phone or laptop within an hour of going to bed. Try to use a sound machine. I use an app called Relax Melodies, which is really great.</p><p>Get blackout curtains or blackout shades. And then finally, look into doctor-recommended medication. Funny story, I used to take Advil. Advil after playing some tennis because my back was sore. Or sometimes I'd take Advil before playing tennis just to kind of be preemptive. And then one time I was like, hey, what's this Advil PM?</p><p>And I would just take it. And I didn't really know what PM was. I thought Advil PM was take Advil in the afternoon, right? That's what PM is. But then my wife told me, no, silly. Advil PM is a pain medication to help you sleep better as well. So I was like, oh, OK.</p><p>So that could be a good two for one if I'm going to take Advil, or if you're going to take Advil anyway. And if you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes, I say get out of bed and do a quiet activity, such as reading or listening to music or yoga or meditation.</p><p>Unfortunately, what I do when I wake up in the middle of the night is just go to my computer and write or read. And that's just a no-no because it just starts stimulating the brain and the eyes with all that blue light. And it's just tough to get back to sleep.</p><p>And it's because also I just get angry that, hey, why am I up at 2 AM? OK, you want to get me up at 2 AM, buddy? I tell myself, OK, well, I'm going to make it productive and do something so that, ha ha, you cannot defeat me. So I've got this kind of weird mentality where I always want to try to be productive.</p><p>And again, I think that's kind of a curse and a blessing. I don't know what you got, but that's what I got. So I hope everybody gets a better night's sleep. I think we're all a little bit suffering from sleep deprivation because there's so much going on in the world.</p><p>There's so much pressure. If you're a new parent, it's just kind of inevitability. So I think maybe also gratitude and thinking about all the great things that are going on in our lives will help us relax more and sleep better. If I can get six hours straight sleep, I'm happy.</p><p>And hopefully, you can get the amount of sleep you require as well. Thanks so much for listening. If you enjoyed this podcast, I'd love a review. I'd love a share. I'd love a subscribe. And I'll speak to you guys later.</p></div></div></body></html>
