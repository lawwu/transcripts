So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">he showed that, and then he went back and worked with engineers to come up with a smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">case where he could actually tell, he could program how much food is given to mice at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">what time of the day or night, completely programmed. So then he took this, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say the ad libitum fed mice eats five grams of chow in a day. And if you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">reduce calories by 20%, then the CR mouse should get four grams of food. And he divided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this into nine or 10 meals, and then gave them in every 90 minutes. So in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">they are eating small meals throughout day and night, so there is no fasting.

And frankly, I was frustrated if you looked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">at one major news outlet, they would say time restricted feeding affords no additional benefit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond caloric restriction for weight loss. Then another popular press venue, let's call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it that, same study described as time restricted feeding doesn't work. Right. And then another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">one, maybe someplace even more extreme, you know, time restricted feeding only beneficial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">because of caloric restriction or something like that. So what you've essentially got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">are three different interpretations of the same data, all of which are, well, two of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">which are true, one of which is false in my opinion. But what I think people take away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">from that is, oh, time restricted feeding isn't valuable, which is not the case. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">for many people, it's a convenient way to eat because at least for people like me, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">simpler to designate between portions of my day when I'm eating and portions of my day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">when I'm not eating, as opposed to portion control. For other people, portion control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">can work.

None of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6dSDq5GV0&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">deals with the potential health benefits independent of weight loss.
