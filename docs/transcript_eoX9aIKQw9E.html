I mean, literally. Probably right. So it's kind of like in the days of the Soviet Union, their military, the red army in every division or unit, there would be a commander or Lieutenant and there'd be a commissar and the commander reported up the chain and the commissar reported to the party and the commissar would just quietly take notes and all of the meetings of the unit. And if the commissar didn't like what the Lieutenant was doing, Lieutenant would be taken out and shot. That's kind of a dramatic example. But the point is that in every large meeting at Google, you've got this DEI commissar who's like quietly taking notes. I'll point out that at Google, the only person we can ever remember to get fired was James Damore, who was an engineer who complained about the political bias at Google. In other words, he was a whistleblower about the very problem that's now manifested. If you're sitting in those meetings with a DEI commissar present and you know, or you have suspicions that the AI product is not working right, are you really going to speak up and risk the fate of a James Damore?</p></div></div></body></html>
