I mean, maybe. So boosting is where you calculate the difference between the actuals and your predictions to get residuals, and then you create a model that tries to predict the residuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can add those two predictions together, which is, if not done carefully, is a recipe for overfitting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if done carefully can be very effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we're talking about something which is conceptually very different, which is saying like, oh, we're like really bad at recognizing this category, so let's show that category more often during training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Of kind of focusing on examples, you're getting it wrong, like more conceptually doing something similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just gonna ask, are the labels ever wrong, like by accident, or intentionally in Kaggle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, or both intentionally as well?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, not intentionally. I mean, not normally, like sometimes there might be a competition where they say like, oh, this is a synthetically generated data set, and some of the data is wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we're trying to do something like what happens in practice, but we can't share the real data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So is there any advantage in trying something like some uncertainty values from something like MC Dropout, try to find like a threshold of things that are too difficult, and then potentially they're wrongly labeled?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure you would need that, like the thing we use in the book and the course is simply to find the things that we are confident of, but we know we're wrong, but turn out to be wrong, and then just look at the pictures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that max values enough, you think, to basically know whether or not it fits? I do, yeah. I mean, that seems to work pretty well. I mean, the only thing is you would need to be able to recognize these things in photos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm sure if you spend an hour reading on the internet about what these different diseases are and how they look, you would be able to pick it up faster soon enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, just like we did in chapter two for recognizing the things that aren't black and brown and teddy bears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So plausibly, even just knocking out some of the extremely difficult examples might get you higher on the leaderboard purely by virtue of them misleading them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not by knocking out the hard ones, but by knocking out the wrong ones, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless the test set is mislabeled consistently with the training set, in which case you would not want to knock them out because you would want to be able to correctly predict the things which people are incorrectly recognizing as the wrong disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something to try, though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. So I would do exactly what we did in chapter two. You know, you can use exactly the same widget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But as I say, you'd have to probably spend an hour learning about rice disease, which probably be a reasonably interesting thing to do anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just a link. There's a discussion in the Patty. Some people identify there's some mislabeling at least over 20 already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. So it definitely happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It says we have manually annotated every image with the help of agricultural experts, but there could be errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this person knows more about rice than I do. I think the images in the tongue grow have a chance of issues. The symptoms can easily be confused with potassium deficiency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Fair enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that an example of what you're talking about where if layman or sorry, if a semi expert gets confused, then the labeling in the test sets probably the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly. So you're probably fixing these would probably screw up your model because assuming that the test set was labeled used by the same people in the same way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, sometimes test sets. The test set is more of a gold standard. They'll make more effort to talk to like a larger number of high quality experts and have them vote or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Honestly, this competition seems like it doesn't even have any prize money attached. So like, I think it's really low, low investment, probably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I doubt they did that. But, but that can happen. Yeah, that the test set could have. I mean, it makes sense to invest in getting really good labels for the test set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was looking at one of the other competitions on UNIFESP, the x-rays. And I think there there was one, somebody had identified that a wrist was wrongly labeled as something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's not, there's no money again but it's been running for a while. What's it called?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">UNIFESP, U-N-I-F-E-S-P.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's another community competition. Gosh, it's not very popular. Why is there only 70-14s?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, sorry, go on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I don't know. I was just looking around and it looked interesting. So I'm number 15 at the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is a slightly weird one because, well, it's interesting because some of the x-rays have multiple labels, but the labels are just concatenated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an interesting discussion on how you'd analyze that. Would you treat a combination as a distinct classification, whether it was like a neck and a chest or something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do you look at each of them individually and then try and label a multiple one from the different things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I'm just having a look at this competition. So when does it close? This is a month to go, but I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly when that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Normally, there's July 31st.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, where do you see that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you go to the bottom of on the overview and it says there's a whole timeline. So then you just hover over that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh my God, I see. It says close in a month, but you actually have to get a toolkit by hovering. Okay, thanks, Tanishk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's strange. It works. Okay, so we've actually got more than a month, so maybe next week we could have a look at this one because it would be a good opportunity to play around with medical image stuff because they're using DICOM, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, somebody has also, which I used, supplied a library of PNGs, which made it easier to use, but I don't know what you'd lose in using that rather than the DICOM images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It rather depends. So DICOM is a very generic file format that can contain lots of different things in it, but one of the things DICOM contains is higher bit depth images than a PNG allows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if they've, yes, they might have gotten rid of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">FastAI has a nice medical imaging, pretty small but like has some useful stuff, Medical Imaging Library, which I think is fastai.vision.medical, which can handle DICOM directly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I see there's a FastAI entry as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That'd be fun. We should try this next week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I see there's the PNGs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the DICOM has come to about 27 gigabytes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh my God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the PNG was quite attractive from that point of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one thing that you can do with DICOM is to compress them, particularly using JPEG 2000, which is a really good compression. But yeah, people often don't for some reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So probably the first thing I'd look at in that competition is to look at DICOM and see is it storing 16 bit data or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it is, I would try to find a way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">resave that without losing the extra information.</span></div><div

like they kind of talk about how all of these things were already there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They just rediscovered them like slightly larger kernel size and things like that, which begs the question, why is it no one just done like experiments to just tweak these things together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it, I mean, these benchmarks, they're like...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing is that like a lot of researchers aren't good practitioners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they just, they're not very good at training accurate neural networks and they don't know these tricks, you know, and they don't hang out on Kaggle and learn about what actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span

even if you did stick it into a PDF and submit it to NeurIPS, there's no particular high likelihood that they're going to accept it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the field research wise is very focused on theory results and, you know, things with lots of Greek letters in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that mean that the part of the problem is that the data sets, the benchmarks are just too inaccessible to the average person?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I wouldn't say that. The issue is I think the culture of research is not particularly interested in experimental results, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With my limited experience, I will say it's very hard to find reviewers as well, especially you have a very strong domain, not just running all the sample data set you can find in open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you call the domain and then a lot of peer reviewers, they're just not picking up to review it. Even if we pay for the reviewers we're using so people can get it for free and we take a few months just to find reviewers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jeremy, so on the topic of papers, when do you know when a paper is worth reading, given the situation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't? I mean, I'm very fond of papers that describe things which did very well in an actual competition, you know, that then we know this is something that actually predicts things accurately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you can get similar results if they've got a good, you know, just table of results. So generally speaking, I like things that actually have good results, particularly if they show like how long it took to check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like how long it took to train and how much data they trained on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, so are they getting good results using less data and less time than you might expect from the same thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, I certainly wouldn't focus only on those that get good results on really big data sets. That's not necessarily more interesting. I'm very interested in things that show good results using transfer learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not practically useful. I don't train that much from random. So I'm very interested in things that do well in transfer learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, like, look for people who you've liked their work before, you know, and in particular, that doesn't mean like always reading the latest papers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if you come across a paper from somebody that you find useful, go back and look at their Google Scholar and read their older papers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See who they collaborate with and read their papers. So, for example, I really like Kwok Lee in Google Brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He and his team do a lot of good work. It tends to be, you know, very practical and high quality results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we know when his team releases a paper, I also know like he seems to have similar interests in mind, like he tends to do stuff involving transfer learning and getting good results in less epochs and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I say he's got a new paper out, I'm pretty likely to read it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question. And I mean, for for the category competitions and like like in a lab type of environment is, I mean, when the question that I have is when to stop iterating on a model on a model that that you have is is I have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">someone asked me when is enough enough to do the training on the data that you have. When is enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that question, I mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some reason you're doing this work, right?

I mean, that goes nuts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK.

So that that means your problem is that you're you're not using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the, you know, the right data to train on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like you need to you. You need to be thinking about how you're going to deploy this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you train it and if you train it with data that's different to how you're going to deploy it, it's not going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so that's that's what that means. And.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be difficult to get data, enough data of the kind you're going to deploy it on. But like at some point, you're going to be deploying this thing, which means by definition, you've got some way of getting that data you're going to deploy it with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like do the exact thing you're going to use to deploy it, but don't deploy it. Just capture that data until you've got some actual data from the actual environment you want to deploy the model in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also take advantage of semi supervised learning techniques to then, you know, and transfer learning to maximize the amount of juice you get from that data that you've collected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, I'd say, like, let's say for medical imaging, like, okay, you want to deploy a model to like a new hospital, they've got a different brand of MRI machine you haven't seen before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would take advantage of fine tuning, you know, each time I deployed it to some different environment where things a bit different, I would expect to have to go through a fine tuning process to train it to recognize that particular MRI machines images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know, each time you do that fine tuning, it shouldn't take very much data or very much time because it's your models already learnt the key features, and you're just asking it to learn to recognize slightly different ways of seeing those features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I don't think you'll solve this by training for longer, you know, you'll solve it by figuring out your, your data pipeline your data labeling and your rollout strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually the issues that we're having is that we don't have enough data of a certain category. But, I mean, the thing that you did yesterday, it results a little bit of that problem I think we're going to start using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well also like, if you don't have enough data of some category, don't use the model for that category, you know, so like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, rather than using softbacks use binary sigmoid, you know, as your last layer and so then you've kind of got like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">probability that x appears in this image and so then you can you can recognize when none of the things that you can predict well appear in the image. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then have a, you know, you always want a human in the loop anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you didn't find any of the categories of things you've got enough data to be able to find then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">triage those to human review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing that we did is, I mean we have like 50 something categories, just one moment, hang on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we had like 50 categories and some of them are like, they have a lot like 10 of them have a lot of items. So we end up doing like in a three step kind of process, like the ones with a lot, the ones with medium number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With a smaller number, and it looks like it resolved the problem a little bit. Cool, but this was to classify metadata coming from, from other systems and classified for legal purposes for legal retention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a question actually, you tried the weighted data loaders right so I think you submitted that to Kaggle notebook. So, did you do any validation locally first before submitting to Kaggle, something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I mean you saw what I did right. And when I did it, so I just.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just like I was intentionally using a very mechanistic approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it was part of like just showing like here's the basic steps of pretty much any computer vision model which is entirely mechanical and doesn't require any domain expertise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, my question more was like, shouldn't be always treat the public leaderboard like a good or like should we take a hold out local data set first to validate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I mean, I always have a validation set. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which we saw in this, and this I just used a random splitter, because as far as I know the test set in the Kaggle competition is a randomly split validation set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so like, whether it be for Kaggle or anything. I think creating a validation set that as closely as possible represents the, the data you expect to get in deployment or in your test set is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, I actually didn't spend the time doing that on this patty competition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Normally on Kaggle if somebody does and notices there's a difference between the private leaderboard and the public leaderboard like the test set and the training set normally it'll appear, you know, in discussions or on a Kaggle kernel or something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is partly why I didn't look into it but yeah I mean you should probably check, doesn't have the same distribution of disease types, you know, from the predictions that you create.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do the images look similar, do they have the same sizes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for me if I said as I see any difference between the test set and the trading set that puts my alarm bells on, right, because now I know that's not randomly selected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you know it's not randomly selected then you immediately have to think okay they're trying to trick us. So, I would then look everything I could for differences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it takes effort to not randomly select a trade a test set so they must be doing it very intentionally for some reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think so, like I don't think a Kaggle competition should ever silently give you a systematically different test set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's great reasons to create a systematically different test set, but there's never a reason not to tell people. So if it's like medical imaging is a different hospital you should say this is a different hospital or if it's fishing you should say these are different boats, or, you know, because like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you want people to do well on your data, so if you tell them, then they can use that information to give you better models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Korean, like, going back to what you asked about, there's this validation in training, then there's this, whether your local validation maps to what's happening on the leaderboard, the score on the hidden test set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's one other scenario that I encountered recently, and maybe it would be interesting to someone. When you're working on a competition, sometimes you might miss something in your code or the prediction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know your model is doing something useful but you're failing to output a correctly formatted submission file, and not in a sense that the submission fails on Kaggle, but some predictions are not aligned where there should be or, you know, therefore a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">customer ID or stuff like that. So, once you have one good submission file, relatively good, you can just store it locally and then see, you know, run a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">check the correlation between your new submission and the one that you know that this, okay, and you know the correlation should be upwards of 0.9, and then you know yeah okay so I didn't mess up anything with the technical aspect of outputting the prediction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's not a great trick but, you know, I was like putting my hair out, why is this not working with a better model. So this was like a sanity checks that maybe at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks.

yeah, that's what happens in Kaggle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we also do the multi objective loss function thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought like next time in our next lesson, broadly speaking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is taking a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2336" target="_blank">00:38:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of want to cover like what the inputs to a model look like and what the outputs to a model look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like in terms of inputs, really the key thing is embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2351" target="_blank">00:39:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the key thing we haven't seen yet in terms of what model inputs look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The model outputs, I think we need to look at softmax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Softmax cross entropy loss, entropy loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, our multi target loss, which we could do first kind of a segue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe in terms of the ordering, the segue would be like doing multi target loss first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we could talk about softmax and cross entropy, which would then lead us potentially to like looking at the bear classifier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What if there's no bears?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2423" target="_blank">00:40:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can just use the binary sigmoid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So then for embeddings, I guess that's where we'd cover the collaborative filtering, collaborative filtering, because that's like a really nice version of embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess the question is, for those who have done the course before, are there any other topics?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2453" target="_blank">00:40:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess like time permitting, it would be nice to look at like the conf net, what a conf net is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2460" target="_blank">00:41:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just kind of say that. So then we've got like the outputs, the inputs, and then the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What about more NLP stuff? I know people like what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I've heard that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2481" target="_blank">00:41:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can face is going to integrate it with past day I may be looking at that how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's not done yet. So you can't do that yet, but definitely in part two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I got a question. I don't know if it's helpful, but there's a lot of emphasis on outputs and inputs. But like in the middle, just understanding like the outputs of a hidden layer, whether they're going awry or not, how do you kind of debug that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you understand when to kind of look at that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Last time we did a part two, we did a very deep dive into that. And I think we should do that again in a part two, because like most people won't have to debug that because if you're using an off-the-shelf model, you know, like it's, you know, with off-the-shelf initializations, that shouldn't happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's probably more of an advanced debugging technique, I would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, if you're interested in looking at it now, definitely check out our previous part two, because we did a very deep dive into that and developed the so-forth colorful dimension plot, which is absolutely great for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2562" target="_blank">00:42:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would exactly, so collaborative filtering would lead us exactly into that. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, sorry, Sarada.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhuhnJMNack&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you like to spend finally talking about the importance of the ethical side?
