And then some light is absorbed and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">travels through the skin.

All of that while considering all the muscles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">involved in making the nuanced expression. Just the subtle squinting of the eyes or the subtle formation of a smile. It's a subtlety of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">human faces that you have to capture. Like the difference between a real smile and a fake smile. But the way to show like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning of a formation of a smile that actually reveals a deep sadness. All of that, like when I watch a human face, I can like read that. I could see that. You have to have the tools that in real time can render something like that. And that's incredibly difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right. Getting faces right requires the interplay of literally dozens of different systems and aspects of computer graphics. And if any one of them is wrong, your eye is completely drawn to that and you find it on the wrong side of Uncanny Valley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The following is a conversation with Tim Sweeney, a legendary video game programmer, founder and CEO of Epic Games that created many incredible games and technologies, including the Unreal Engine and Fortnite, which both revolutionized the video game industry and the experience of playing and creating video games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Tim Sweeney.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When did you first fall in love with computers and maybe with programming?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a brother, Steve Sweeney, who is 16 years older than me. And at some point when I was a little kid, he went off to work in California for a tech company and he'd gotten one of the first IBM PCs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for one summer, I think I was about 11, I went to visit him in California. It was my first trip away from my family just to hang out with him. And he had this brand new IBM computer. And I learned to program over the course of a few days in BASIC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just blown away with the capabilities of computers at the time. It was unbelievable what they could accomplish. And I was just hooked from that point onward and very much wanted to be a programmer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you remember what you wrote in BASIC? Is it a video game type thing? Is it like for loop, some numerical thing? Do you remember?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's funny. I have a perfectly vivid memory of all of the first things I learned to program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a hard time remembering people's names, but like code really sticks with me. Every step and every challenge, there were lessons learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of which I've come to realize were just like me getting over some learning hurdles. But other things were actually shortcomings of programming languages and the realization that there are actually better ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when a programmer is learning to program for the first time, a lot of what they're facing isn't the challenge of learning a new art. It's friction introduced by failures of programming language design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've constantly come back to those early lessons there as I've progressed and done more and more things, including building programming languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the friction and the pain is the guide to learning in programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if I were to describe programming journey, that would be marked by pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that pain, you shouldn't escape the pain. The pain is instructive for you to understand programming languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But do you remember what kind of stuff you were writing at that time, just the early programs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, in the early days, I wrote a little bit of everything. I wrote some games. The first game I wrote on the Apple II was, since I only knew how to program in text mode, the computer would throw asterisks across the screen, they'd flow from left to right, and you'd have a parentheses on the right-hand side of the screen, and it looked like a baseball mitt, and you're supposed to catch the asterisks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That was my very first game. It took about a couple hours to build and tune, and I went from there. But I built a lot of things. I built databases at different points. I built a programming language in a full compiler for a language like Pascal, because I didn't know where you went to buy one of those, so I made my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the fun things of that time was bulletin boards. Before we had the internet in the hands of consumers, you used your modem, and you dialed into a local phone number and connected to whoever was running the computer there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Every town or city had hundreds of these bulletin boards run by different people with their own personalities and themes, and so I spent a lot of time building a bulletin board program and learning how to deal with database management and user interface and dealing with multiple users concurrently and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I probably found about 10 or 15,000 hours writing code just on my own as a kid between age 10 and age 20 before I actually shipped a program to the outside world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">10,000 to 15,000 hours. What was the value of the hours as a kid you put in in programming that led to the success you've had in later life? Maybe this is by way of advice to younger people in terms of how they allocate the hours of their early life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you know, it's not just hours. It's really striving to learn, to understand what knowledge you have, what knowledge you lack, and to continually do experiments and work on projects that improve your knowledge base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I didn't do this with a great amount of structure or planning. I was rather just going from project to project doing things that I thought would be fun and cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And with each project, I learned new things. Learning about how to store and manage data, learning how to deal with advanced data structures, how to write complex programs that have deeply nested data and control flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Each one of those, you know, provide a lesson, which were later essential. You know, when in 1991, I released my first game. And over the course of that decade, we went from, you know, zero commercial releases to the first generation Unreal Engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, this was largely just using the knowledge that I'd built up over the previous decade. Just doing fun hobby projects. And if I hadn't done all of that work, there's no way I could have ever built the things that came later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">All the experimentation and all the exploration somehow contributed, somehow made sense later on. Like all of that is integrated somehow in the stuff you build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's funny how life works. Like the pieces kind of come together eventually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. You know, there are definitely karate kid moments because, you know, all this time I was learning math in high school and in college, I studied mechanical engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, you learn all kinds of math, vector calculus and vector math and matrices and, you know, all these related fields, physics and stress and strain and how to, you know, deal with complex physical systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, I wasn't really sure how engineers would actually make use of that knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you just like forget about it when you actually go off to do work or is it, do you write down equations on paper?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It was actually not clear as an early engineering student what you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I started writing the first generation on real engine and I was dealing with 3D math, I was like, wait, I know this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I learned this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, so, you know, suddenly like the karate kid, you know, you get to paint the fence and wax the car and suddenly put all the pieces together into, you know, a 3D engine based on a whole lot of accumulated programming language and math knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Often knowledge gained without ever anticipating that I might use it in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, I think what's useful is over and over learning a hard thing and then showing to yourself, you know, that you can do it, that you can learn a hard thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So then when you come to having to write a 3D engine that in ways that haven't been done before, you're like, I've been here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been here in this experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I don't know what to do, but we'll figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll learn all the necessary components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So just not being afraid of something new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And constantly striving to make connections between these fields and look for their applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Long after I chipped on Unreal Engine, it was like going back through an engineering textbook and looking at, oh, yeah, I use that, I use that, I use that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I got to the section on eigenvalues and I'm like, I don't know what the hell this is, but, you know, it turns out eigenvectors and eigenvalues were the critical breakthrough that made the Google search engine technology work and stand apart from the rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they found if you threw all the links that existed in the web and, you know, links from and to different sites and you put them in a giant matrix and you concluded that you found the dominant eigenvalues, then those eigenvectors described the best search results for different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so constantly picking up knowledge and looking for ways to put it together is the thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you aspire to be a programmer, you've got to write a lot of code and you've got to continually learn new things and improve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you want to be an artist, you've got to continually draw artwork of all styles and all kinds and constantly push yourself to learn more and more because you never know exactly what you're going to end up doing in the long run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But the more knowledge you have and the more skills, the more chance you have putting it together and being successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And whether you're a programmer or an artist, you should probably take linear algebra, even though it doesn't make sense at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I found getting an engineering degree and then never working in an engineering field, you know, just being a computer programmer was immensely valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I went to University of Maryland, which for some disciplines, it's kind of known as a party school, but they worked the engineers to death, worked really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you learn any engineering discipline, you learn massive amounts of math and you learn the rigor of problem solving, you know, not just what you find from the Wikipedia article, but going through all the exercises of solving complex problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And building up series of problems and building up series of solutions to derive an answer, it's valuable and it embodies the knowledge that you need as a programmer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, people often go to university and think, OK, my goal here is to get good grades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I get a diploma and I prove to an employer that I'm valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, no, that's just kind of the superficial bookkeeping of the university.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The real purpose of all of this is to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And whether you learn formally or you learn on your own, it's the learnings that are really valuable in a career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially if you're going to be entrepreneurial, it's really knowing the stuff that matters and not having the diplomas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, there's ever more pressure to make a rebuild society more and more around credentials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have this

that are focused on just building great products and doing great things gravitate towards people who do the great work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the freedom there and the organic learning that occurred there, I think it's something that is really critical to the American experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I worry is increasingly going away as society is ever more protective and sheltering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it makes it harder to get these experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So on the video game side, when did you first fall in love with video games?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had a funny relationship with games because my real aspiration has always been to program cool stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I get more enjoyment out of programming than anything else in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, my first really too formative experience with games were playing this game called Adventure for the Atari 2600.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like, you moved this dot around the screen and picked up objects like swords and fought dragons and invaded castles and solved puzzles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Very, very simple, iconic stuff, you know, rather than realistic graphics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the other game that really got immersed in was Zork, which was a text adventure game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It would tell you where you are and what you see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'd type in commands like go north or pick up sword or open door and explore a world that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the game didn't have any graphics, but in your mind you had this elaborate picture of what you were seeing there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And it really brought in inspired imagination or other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And playing those games led me to often want to learn to program everything that I saw there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that drove a lot of my programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I learned how to move a player around the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I learned how to, you know, build a design tool so I could build castles and save them off and play them in a game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realized there was a separation between the tools that you use to build a game and the game itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that if the more powerful tools you had, the more creativity you could unleash in yourself or others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I learned all the programming techniques that supported games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">How to parse text, you know, pick up sword and go north.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you make that sentence into an actual series of commands on the computer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was really, really exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to say, until the time that Fortnite came out, I played video games primarily to learn what they were doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could go off and do that myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd go through and look at it pixel by pixel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd move the mouse very slightly and look at exactly what was happening to figure out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1029"

target="_blank">00:17:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a puzzle solving at a grand scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was so fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So take me there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">In the early 90s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you launched Epic Games in 1991.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're the writing of your first big video game, ZZT.</span></div><div

that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a funny project because I didn't start out to build a video game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I just moved from an Apple II.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So my brother bought my family an Apple II right after I'd visited them in California.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd been programming on that for a few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Learned a lot of techniques.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But there weren't many Apple II users around still by the time that cycle came to an end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd just gotten an IBM PC of my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I was learning to program and I realized I needed a text editor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I started writing a text editor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, a text editor is a program that's to edit text files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You have logic to move the cursor around and let people type things and backspace and delete and do all of those mundane actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, one night I was like, I'd finished it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, well, OK, I have a text editor, but this is pretty boring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So I made the cursor into a smiley face character.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had the, like, different characters you could place in this document perform different gameplay actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Some would be walls and some would kill you and some would be moving objects that could fly around the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this text editor I made evolved into a little game editor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was building these levels for a game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I put a lot of time into, like, building an editor in a primitive set of objects, about 20 or 30 different objects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">enough to build a really cool and compelling game, but not so many that players would lose track of what they're seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I started off just building different game levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the idea is you'd be on a series of boards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They'd be connected by, you know, going north, back to the end of the current board,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">would take you to a new one if it was open, or maybe it was blocked and you couldn't go there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I built this whole game world around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, this was the game that became ZZT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was having fun with it, building it and playing it, but I didn't know if it would really work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So I did this experiment, started inviting neighbors over, like some adults, some kids of all different ages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and sat them down in front of them and said, like, here's a game I made, figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

what they need to do, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I really wanted to learn if they were able to, you know, discover it all for themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, today we would call this, you know, user experience test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a whole field of research around user experience research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But back then it was just inviting some kids over to play the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I took notes about what they got stuck on and what they enjoyed and where they felt bored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And just iteratively polished the game until I felt it was good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I put it out and released it on, well, this was before the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So there were bulletin boards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I uploaded it to a bunch of local bulletin boards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And from there it started spreading because, you know, the way to build up cred for bulletin board users was to upload new files and to claim that, hey, I was the first that brought this to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, so there was a natural tendency of the software to spread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.860</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">You know, so I didn't just build this one game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I built a trilogy of three games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1216"

$30 and you can get the sequels to this game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.800</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, being a 20-year-old, that was, like, a pretty big deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What did that feel like, just getting money and probably feeling this immense success from something you've created?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1251"

critical thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's always been just very utilitarian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But the knowledge that other people all around the country and then, you know, a month later all around the world were playing the game, that was mind-boggling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that me, like this little kid who'd put out a game on a local bulletin

and they had it, and that was it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But software could spread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That was just really cool to see, and it made me realize there was really no upward limit on the potential for a business like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we saw Microsoft as a big juggernaut company at the time, but it was like, hey, you know, if Epic does games good enough, you know, we could accomplish what they've accomplished with operating systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And the sky was the limit, and I think this is the age we live in

around with it, you're building up the tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's such an inspiring moment, because a lot of us start out building a project, and to allow yourself to see the potential pivots, the potential trajectories that can go is really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">To sit back, allow yourself to

<span class="t">I mean, that's like a crossroads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.220</a></span> |

<span class="t">You designed your own programming language, you built compilers, databases, all these things you mentioned, and you started building a text editor, and then here it came to this crossroad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to make this fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from there, you know, one of the most legendary gaming companies was created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's an inspiring thing for sort of developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, be open to the possibility of creating something you didn't plan to create, and just go with it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and it was, a bunch of learnings emerged really quickly there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The neat thing I did with ZZT was, I didn't just release the game, I also released the editor with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I built this tool so I could make these ZZT boards that people could play, but I also gave it to all the players themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, like 30 years later, I still run into people, you know, when I go to a game industry event, it was like, you know, I grew up playing ZZT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, here's an adult who grew up playing my game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was because it enabled anybody to become a creator, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It had, you know, this little board editor, and it also had a little scripting language, so you could learn a little bit of programming in it, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it kind of impressed, and it really set a formative principle of Epic, which was that, you know, the company's mission is to make awesome entertainment, but also awesome tools, and to share those tools with everybody so that they can build their own amazing things, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, when we got into Unreal Engine a few years later, the interplay between us building a game and us building tools that were widely used by others was a critical part of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's the sole reason that Epic has been massively successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, the reason that we've survived all of this time is that by serving both creators and gamers, we've been able to weather the ups and downs of the game industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a brutal place for companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We've been able to survive every financial downturn, and sometimes the engine's been funding the business because we didn't have a game, and sometimes the games have been funding the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And it really set a principle in our culture that's persevered and is continually brought to their forefront.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But on the editor front, that's such a fascinating philosophy, that you always allow people to create their own worlds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have an engine from which you simulate the world that the game is in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You have the actual game, and you also have the freedom for creators to create various, you know, in Fortnite, islands of their own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like with everything you ship, that freedom to create is always there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and it's something we aim to do more and more fully over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, in the course of building Fortnite, we've built a lot of other tools that are useful for us, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's not just a game powered by Unreal Engine, but it's also, you know, a social ecosystem where people can make friends and voice chat and get together and party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've opened up all of those social features into Epic Online Services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we give them away to all developers for free, because we all benefit from growth in that user base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, our goal is ultimately to build the company's products and the same technology that we share with everybody else, and to help that foster a bigger and bigger ecosystem over time where everybody benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">If we could just linger on the 90s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you said built-in boards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you can explain what that's like, and also explain the birth of the Internet, what that was like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1573"

became more and more open as they connected universities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1592"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It was often busy, and you couldn't get in.</span></div><div

get to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But you had all kinds of communities develop, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could see, like, there was the programming communities where people talked about programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">There was the news and events, you know, community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I lived in the outskirts of Washington, D.C., so that was, like, a big thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But then there was, like, the pirate community where they're sharing pirated Apple II games and, you know, very different community ethos and mantras out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But all, you know, all really nice and also very small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">These things, these bulletin boards couldn't grow to the size of Facebook because your phone line couldn't take that many calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, then later in the 1990s, the Internet, which had been fostered in these colleges, started opening up for the public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And anybody could connect to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, suddenly the world took on a life of its own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It became much, much easier to reach a global audience faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you would start shipping games to the Internet, which is a bit of a crazy thing to do because you're supposed to have, like, a, you know, a physical copy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But to post on the Internet is pretty innovative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Even Shareware is pretty innovative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's been a funny transition for the game business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Epic started out making Shareware games distributed digitally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, as the first 3D games took off, like, you know, Wolfenstein and Doom from id Software and then Unreal from us took off, you know, to reach a huge audience of millions of users, we had to go into retail stores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we worked with a retail publisher, and they made a box, and they put CD-ROMs in the box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, then the world started transitioning back to digitally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1736" target="_blank">00:28:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, and that transition didn't start well, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The initial transition of gaming to digital was all BitTorrent, all piracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, there are horror stories about games that would, you know, sell, like, 100,000 copies but have 2 million users because most people pirated it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, Steam came along and introduced digital distribution and made digital distribution of legit games so convenient that most players moved away from piracy towards that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, their practices were then followed by others, and the early digital industry took form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, pirates do lead the way for innovation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The same as the story of Spotify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You basically, I think most people, when they derive value from things like video games, want to pay for those video games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They just want it to be easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that, the same thing with music with Spotify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But maybe just staying in the 90s, there are going to be a lot of indie game developers who listen to us talking today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you go back to that mindset and try to derive some wisdom and advice to those folks when you were just a solo developer, maybe just a small group of people creating your early games that eventually became this huge gaming company?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you know, one of the critical things that Epic always worked hard to do was to make something different that nobody else was doing and to try to satisfy a small audience rather than competing globally with the game juggernauts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, back in the 1990s, Epic was new, but Electronic Arts and Activision and the other big publishers had been around for a decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were huge companies that had giant retail distribution networks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if I tried to make a game and then convince them to publish it, I doubt I could have had a chance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I doubt that even if I made a successful game, that I would have made much money from it, though they might have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, so the really unique angle to Epic then was shareware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was just the idea that if we distribute our game differently, then we can reach a much larger audience than these bigger competitors by virtue of this first episode of the game being free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it was kind of the advent of what later became free to play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the logic of that is just as true now as it was then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">If the thing is free and anybody can get into it, then it's going to spread from friend to friend as people bring their real-world friends into the games they're playing and have the opportunity to build up a community around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other lesson there was minimize the friction of people getting into your game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Make it easier to get into and make it fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the other, well, I was very fortunate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">ZZT was a funny game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It was not like, much like any other game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It had much worse graphics because it was all just text characters, smiley faces and, you know, other Greek letters and things participating in this game simulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They were kind of iconic representations of characters rather than real ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, this was decades into the age of real graphical games with interesting graphics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it wasn't even trying to compete in that area, but it was able to compete in a different area, which is that, you know, it wasn't just my, the three games I'd made and shipped as a trilogy that were successful and drove the success of the product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the fact that I released an editor and there's a whole community around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you see that, that, that trend has repeated itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there was, you know, ZZT was one of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Before that, there was Bill Budge's pinball construction set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a 1980s Apple game that let users build their own pinball tables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And since then, you've had some of the world's most successful games follow that path, like Minecraft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You can build your own stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Roblox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, games that become platforms for other people to build stuff was a real opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think the big thing to realize as for indie developers right now is like there's massive, massive competition in every major genre.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's very unlikely that unless you just happen to be the world's best at a particular thing that you're going to release a game and an existing highly competitive genre and win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">A much better chance of success is in releasing something that hasn't been done before, being really unique and reaching an audience, even if big or medium size or small, reaching an audience and becoming really popular with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Making some money from it and being able to reinvest and then expand towards your ultimate dream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think the one shot go from idea to commercial success at massive scale is a lot less likely than the multi-step process of continually build better and better stuff over time until you get into a position of excellence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You can constantly try to do something that others aren't doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you look at every market, there's a few markets where the current leader came late to the space, usually because the prior leader failed so horribly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But most of the time, you know, the company that's succeeding and winning in a market is the first or second entrant there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.600</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">Great advice. Fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But on a human level, was it lonely? Was it scary? You sitting there as a developer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say it was the opposite of lonely because, you know, the thing that spurred me to actually release this was seeing kids playing the game in my neighborhood and having fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, like, this is really good. And seeing them enjoying it and laughing and pointing at the screen and, you know, getting together and just wanting to play more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And the human element was always pervasive, you know, because I did not only receive orders, but people would actually write letters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we wrote letters back then in the 1990s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">People would say how much they were enjoying the game and how their kids were playing the game and so on and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, they felt very connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I think a lot of businesses have to make scary decisions because you're spending, you know, potentially all the money you have to take a shot at something that you're not sure will succeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I was very fortunate starting a business like this because it didn't really need any capital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The capital was, well, the several thousand dollars in computers I'd bought by mowing lawns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't much risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2127" target="_blank">00:35:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If that hadn't succeeded, I guess I could have figured out how people get mechanical engineering jobs and pursued that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But once it took off and once the orders started coming in and people started writing letters saying they're enjoying the game, I knew I was going to go all out and try to build a company there and succeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was, like, going to be, you know, my big goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm sure people know, but Epic Games was created in 1991 and went on to transform the gaming industry several times, one of which is Unreal Engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's talk to the origin story of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You said that when Wolfenstein and Doom came out, that changed everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, take me to that moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that was a very interesting time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Epic had, after my first couple of games, had recruited developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, usually college students, high school students who are just working on their own had real skills but didn't have an outlet for their work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Epic had been matchmaking the best artists and programmers together from all over the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2190" target="_blank">00:36:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, Chaz Jackrabbit was Cliff Beluzinski, a high school kid in California who'd made a really cool adventure game together with Arian Brucie, a demo coder from Holland who'd make amazing graphical stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And had built a 2D game engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And it connected them together and a musician, Robert Allen, in California.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, by telephone and modem and so on, we were building these little 2D games and having quite a lot of success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2213" target="_blank">00:36:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there were a bunch of people making thousands of dollars a month while they were still students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And royalties from the games that Epic was kind of producing and by coordinating people with people and publishing through shareware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was all going great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2228" target="_blank">00:37:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the company had a little office and we were, you know, copying floppy disks and mailing them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But when Wolfenstein came out, we realized, like, the future of gaming is going to be 3D.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There had been a lot of experiments in 3D before that hadn't been great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there were 3D renderings of mazes that were not in real time and you were always looking north, south, east or west.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there were vector graphics with little wireframes moving around and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, Wolfenstein was the first game that was fast enough, you know, running at 30 frames per second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It really felt immersive.</span></div><div

fighting Nazis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was a really amazing and immersive experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">3D graphics were pretty primitive then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2273" target="_blank">00:37:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It software followed shockingly fast with Doom, which was a much, much more capable 3D engine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">which had, you know, stairs and, though it was still what we call 2.5D.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2284" target="_blank">00:38:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It was environments that were very realistic, textures that were very realistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, a form of lighting that was approximate but incredibly realistic and just such great artistry and sound effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It felt completely visceral and real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

at Epic independently went off and started writing our own 3D graphics code to figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found at one point we had a number of people dabbling in this, doing different parts of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

is going to completely change the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.660</a></span> | <span

games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">He made it while he was in college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2480" target="_blank">00:41:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was making, like, $30,000 a month from, you know, the royalties from this game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because everybody had wanted an awesome pinball game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It was massively successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But he was a multilegisciplinary person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He wrote the code for the game, the art for the game, and did basically everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the code was 30,000 lines of assembly language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he was initially going to write the 3D engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was going to write the editor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And he sent me his code so I could integrate it into the editor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was, like, just a giant pile of assembly code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, hmm, why don't I just write this myself?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so James instead started going off and building 3D models and 3D animations using the tools at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2520" target="_blank">00:42:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Cliff, who had done a lot of design work and built the levels on Jazz Jacket, went off and started learning basics of level design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was writing this editor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And Cliff Blazinski was customer number one for it, starting to go off and build levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And James Schmaltz was building awesome creatures, sending them to me, getting them implemented in-game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And we brought in an animator to bring them to life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we brought in more and more people until at the peak of Unreal 1 development, we had about 20 people working on it, which was a huge team for the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was really stretching Epic's finances nearly to the breaking point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We barely survived and almost ran out of money a number of times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But somehow we always pulled through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a crazy project because it was three and a half years of development in a game that we always thought was six months from shipping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like three and a half years of 70 or 80 hour weeks for most everybody working on the project, not even knowing what problems we'd need to solve next because we were so immersed in the current ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Were there moments when you were losing hope that this might take too long and the company will run out of money?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We were always very financially stressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was continually worried about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I had total confidence that we'd work out all the technical and artistic problems because, you know, we knew the pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was largely a matter of typing code in and solving some problems and kind of like we knew we could ship a version of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing that was continually really interesting was the ongoing discovery of new techniques as we went, you know, because at the time Quake had shipped, it had a little bit of dynamic lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Unreal really pushed dynamic lighting much harder than anybody else had done before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Having colored dynamic lights with some shadow casting capabilities statically or moving lights without shadows and figured out how to do volumetric fog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could have foggy areas that were full of lights and, you know, you get the kind of glow of the lights standing out in the fog and affecting the appearance of the level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2643" target="_blank">00:44:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A whole lot of amazing techniques came together to build a game that made a number of leaps ahead of the state of the art at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it was really crazy, but like, I think most companies wouldn't have survived that, but the sheer talent of the people involved made it possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Epic has often done things that most companies will have failed at, and we succeed, like, not because of awesome management or awesome planning or awesome financing, but because of the sheer talent and willpower of the people involved to make it happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but what about the interdisciplinary aspect of it, like you said, sort of artists, engineers, programmers, designers, all of them working together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What was that, the 20 people, what was the dynamic there like working insane hours?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what was it like to sort of make a team like that work together well as an orchestra to actually deliver the game?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's one of the really unique things that exists in gaming, not in normal big tech companies, which are just engineering and business driven, but gaming really does require all the best people across all the creative disciplines working together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Epic had grown organically by recruiting people with awesome talent, we always had a limited budget, we could never pay to bid up people's salaries and hire them away by paying them more, we just had to find awesome people who were at the beginning of their career and put them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So everybody was very new to this and didn't have any assumptions about how companies worked, and so you put all these people together and it was really a constant interplay of talent as people were learning how to work together as a team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody had management experience, most people hadn't shipped at a game before they worked with Epic, and we were figuring out as we went.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was a constant iterative cycle, you know, we'd make several new versions of the game every day, read a new compile, introduce a new feature, or fix some bugs, get it to artists, artists, improve their levels, continue building stuff, and then we see what they're doing in their levels, like, ah, I see what you need now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We'd constantly be improving the tools and just the iterative process and the speed at which that improves products is the critical element to success in games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The slower the iteration cycle, if you make a build every week, and you prove you go through one iteration every week, you're going to be way, way, way worse by the end of your project than a game company that makes, you know, new stuff every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2798" target="_blank">00:46:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the magic that happened together, and it wasn't, there was really nothing but passion and everybody's individual dedication to it that made it work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I heard you still program, but how much programming were you doing back then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned hours, probably insane hours, so, like, it'd be almost fun to talk about your setup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2819" target="_blank">00:46:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">What a day in the life of Tim Sweeney in the 90s when you were building Unreal looked like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2827" target="_blank">00:47:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we'd all gravitated towards a schedule, a work schedule that maximized productivity, and that usually meant waking up late.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd get to, like, usually get to work around noon, and usually work till, like, 2 a.m. or so, 3 a.m. sometimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I didn't have anything else going on in my life, so it usually just work and sleep and occasional eating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I found I always needed 8 or 9 hours of sleep a night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Without good sleep, I would just become a zombie and wouldn't be nearly at my best, so I always needed to get sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But I didn't need anything else going on, so I just, the programming itself was so energizing and drawing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so it was, you know, 3 and a half years of that during the project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Mostly spent programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say probably 60 hours a week of programming, 5 hours a week of coordinating with other people and iterating and, you know, sitting down with them and looking at what's going on in screen and figuring out what they needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe 5 hours of business stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's a good division at labor then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't have a big executive team, but it was, like, basically myself running the technical and development part of the company and Mark Rain running the business part of it, doing deals and, you know, maxing out his credit card and going around the world, bringing in sources of revenue to keep the company funded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What programming language?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we talking about C?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you mentioned there's this pile of assembly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">What was your decision in choosing the programming language that Unreal Engine would be written in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd grown up learning with Pascal as my favorite language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">In order to just get maximum performance and get the latest operating system features, I had to move to C for my second game, Joel of the Jungle, a little Nintendo-style platformer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when I started Unreal Engine, it was on 16-bit Windows using the C programming language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And over the course of the first year, it moved to 32-bit using these DOS extenders and then using Windows NT, and I moved to the C++ language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Just because it simplified the code so much went from a really complicated pile of code to a much simpler one, making that transition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so almost the entirety of Unreal Engine development, about two and a half years of it, was all on C++, 32-bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Completely state-of-the-art then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, 32-bit protected mode was kind of a magical thing, having come from the days when computers were much less reliable and crashed all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2977" target="_blank">00:49:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and it turned out to be a pretty good bet, because C++, out of all those languages, ended up being the dominant sort of performance-oriented language that survives to this day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=2991" target="_blank">00:49:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because it solves all of the problems at scale, often through manual pain, but always solves them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the Pentium was the first super scaler architecture in consumer computing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3106"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was just enough performance to deliver that.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3147" target="_blank">00:52:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And a 200 megahertz CPU.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So it, like, tripled the speed of compiles and just made me massively more

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3183" target="_blank">00:53:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we did most Unreal Engine development before the first real GPUs came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the 3D effects

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we supported it really quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was not the target all along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so development was focused on just building.</span></div><div class="c"><span

graphics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3228" target="_blank">00:53:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the cost of

| <span class="t">And so Nanite is the system, we'll jump around in time, that takes us to today with Unreal Engine 5,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the system that does the geometry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So rendering the world sort of geometrically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's many layers to this, we'll probably talk, sneak up to each of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But one, you have to actually create the geometry of the world around you and do that in real time and really efficiently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a bunch of different ways to optimize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you just speak to it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, with the advanced art tools we have today, it's really easy to create a scene with billions of polygons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The hard part is how to render it efficiently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3417" target="_blank">00:56:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you can't render billions of polygons in a frame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3420" target="_blank">00:57:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, you want to render an image that's indistinguishable from the full detailed geometry if you rendered it at ridiculous cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the challenge is how to simplify every component of the rendering, you know, the geometry, the lighting, and so on, down to real-time techniques.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3437" target="_blank">00:57:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They're efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They capture a realistic view of what's around you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3441" target="_blank">00:57:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when an object is up close to you, you want to render it with a lot more polygons than when it's far away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the cool principles of mathematics is the Nyquist sampling theorem that says if you're trying to reconstruct a signal, there's a limit to the amount of data you need to bother capturing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to render a texture at a certain resolution, then you never need more than twice the pixels than in the texture that you have on the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, that's called the Nyquist limit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one of the challenges of computer graphics is given the need to render objects at extreme close-up distances and extreme faraway distances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You always want to be able to generate the right amount of geometry so that you have enough to be indistinguishable from reality, but not any more than necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3485" target="_blank">00:58:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, with geometry, the idea is that if you render two triangles per pixel, you should get an image that is indistinguishable from thousands of triangles per pixel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you render less than two triangles per pixel, you're going to start to see visible artifacts of the loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3501" target="_blank">00:58:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And GPUs have this amazing hardware in a lot of different pipelines, but it's all very fixed function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3507" target="_blank">00:58:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There's pixel shader hardware, there's geometry processing hardware, and then there's triangle rasterization hardware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the limits of GPUs is that the triangle rasterizers are built for pretty large triangles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're building a triangle or rendering a triangle with 10 pixels, that's pretty efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're building or rendering a triangle with one pixel, it's very inefficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the breakthroughs Brian made was to design an entire pipeline for avoiding the rasterization hardware in the GPU,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3533" target="_blank">00:58:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and just going straight to pixels and calculating what should be done with that pixel as a result of some ray tracing and geometry intersection calculations done in a pixel shader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of using the triangle pipeline, we're just using pixel pipeline and getting a better result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Because of the limitations of the triangle rasterizer in the GPUs, that's fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3557" target="_blank">00:59:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, as you described, you need the tiny triangles for the detail, for the stuff that's up close.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3564" target="_blank">00:59:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this might seem obvious to people, but it's not just stuff up close.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, it depends on where you're looking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the human eye and the human focus and the human attention mechanism defines how much detail you want to show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the thing that the human is likely to be giving attention to, you want that to be super high resolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And everything else, including due to distance, can have less geometry and less texture, less information in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3596" target="_blank">00:59:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of challenges like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3599" target="_blank">00:59:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It turns out it's a lot easier to render one frame that looks perfect than it is to render a series of frames in motion that look perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the problems with the earlier algorithms that aspired to do this sort of thing was popping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You'd be running some number of triangles for a while, and then you'd switch to a different number of triangles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and you'd see a visible transition, and the screen would look like it got shaken up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3622" target="_blank">01:00:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a disturbing artifact that distracts you from the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3625" target="_blank">01:00:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one of the magical trade-offs of Nanite was how to avoid all of the visible transitions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3630" target="_blank">01:00:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and get them down to a point where, though they exist statistically, they're not really perceptible to a person looking at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

folks like me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's inspiring to

it's good to actually explain what Unreal Engine is for people sort of outside this world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3717"

one of the critical things that kept Epic going through that three and a half years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3943" target="_blank">01:05:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We were starting to license our engine out to other developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3946" target="_blank">01:05:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Microprose took two licenses, and we got in half a million dollars from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And the company, GT Interactive, licensed our engine to build another game, and we got paid for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we had this revenue stream funding the development of Unreal Engine from other games that were being built by other developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And because they were the

target="_blank">01:06:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We set up mailing lists so that our partners could ask us questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3976" target="_blank">01:06:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And all the developers and artists working on our games were participating and helping customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3981" target="_blank">01:06:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody took that

<span class="t">And, you know, that's kind of set this dual spirit of Epic of building technology and supporting game developers simultaneous with building games and supporting gamers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=3993" target="_blank">01:06:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's continued onward and just

building is extremely tedious if you are only adding objects to the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4061" target="_blank">01:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to build a door, then you need to add like a dozen different pieces of door frames and add a bunch of different walls together to fit together in the right shape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4067" target="_blank">01:07:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It

target="_blank">01:07:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we had this way of adding geometry to the world and subtracting geometry, and the engine would perform all of the calculations on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4078" target="_blank">01:07:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is something that I'd

class="t">But when I finally got around to it, it took this 30-hour coding session to figure out all the special cases of the code that needed to be implemented to make that work.</span></div><div

geometry up and running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I started

then subtracted a cylinder from it and created this really advanced composite object with just three operations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

efficiently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4157" target="_blank">01:09:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then plus the usual

this technique for all of its graphics and rendering, but it, you know, it was just additive geometry everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it had a lot of overlapping polygons and was pretty

idea that if we had a BSP tree, there was a really efficient way to do constructive solid geometry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4278" target="_blank">01:11:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And to do that, you had to break down the ways that different pieces of geometry can fit together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4283" target="_blank">01:11:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I broke it down into,

also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4326" target="_blank">01:12:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's the problem with geometry is, like, there's probably just going to be all kinds of weird polygons that you have to...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4349" target="_blank">01:12:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the 1% that's the really

<span class="t">What about, like, lighting?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4356" target="_blank">01:12:36.640</a></span> | <span

class="t">Well, the funny answer is, like, we know the laws of physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4360" target="_blank">01:12:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's actually really easy to do everything in computer graphics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4363" target="_blank">01:12:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the direct solution of the laws of physics is immensely slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4368" target="_blank">01:12:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we're finding are approximations rather than complete solutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4372" target="_blank">01:12:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you need something that's a million times faster than the brute force answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4377" target="_blank">01:12:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We should say that the physics of the seed is you just take a bunch of photons and bounce them around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4384" target="_blank">01:13:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how light works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4385" target="_blank">01:13:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4386" target="_blank">01:13:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to be very inefficient because there's a lot of bouncing and a lot of photons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4390" target="_blank">01:13:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, photon tracing is the subject matter that does brute force calculation of pixels on a screen from all of the light in the scene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4399" target="_blank">01:13:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it works and it's correct and it just is an implementation of laws of physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4404" target="_blank">01:13:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's millions or billions of times slower than what we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4407" target="_blank">01:13:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But Carmack had figured out how to do really cool lighting algorithms, including real-time lighting with objects moving around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I hadn't taken it very far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4419" target="_blank">01:13:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So with Unreal Engine, I'd realized we don't have nearly enough computing performance on our sepia to compute the light of every pixel on the screen from all of the light sources that affect it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4431" target="_blank">01:13:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We were at a six-cycle texture mapper and we couldn't afford 30 more cycles for lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4436" target="_blank">01:13:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the answer had to be some approximation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4439" target="_blank">01:13:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The one that Carmack had picked up on in the Quake engine was light mapping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4443" target="_blank">01:14:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of calculating all the lighting on every pixel, what if we made a big texture that we placed over all of the walls in the scene that was like wallpaper?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4453" target="_blank">01:14:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And what if we say at every foot, we're going to compute a lighting value for just that one foot grid on the object rather than computing it everywhere?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4461" target="_blank">01:14:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if we just linear interpolate that over the course of it, you get a lighting solution that actually works pretty well and is fast enough to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of Unreal Engine's lighting techniques were based on light mapping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4474" target="_blank">01:14:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We introduced colored lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4476" target="_blank">01:14:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could have colored light sources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4478" target="_blank">01:14:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we realized, oh, since we're doing this and we're doing it on light maps, we can actually do some pretty expensive calculations, hundreds of cycles, since we're only calculating it for every one foot of world space rather than every pixel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4488" target="_blank">01:14:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we introduced a whole bunch of elaborate lighting effects, like torch flickering and the caustic effects of water bouncing off of a surface and so on, and pulsing lights and blinking lights and everything else, and I created a system for compositing them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4506" target="_blank">01:15:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you had an arbitrary number of light sources, they could all do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4508" target="_blank">01:15:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, I implemented a shadowing algorithm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4513" target="_blank">01:15:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if you cast a ray from a point on a light, from a light to a point on a surface and see if whether it intersects any other geometry, if it doesn't intersect, then the light hits the object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4523" target="_blank">01:15:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it does intersect, then the light hits something else first, and that pixel on the object should be dark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4531" target="_blank">01:15:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I built a real-time version of this, and it ran at about a half a frame a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4536" target="_blank">01:15:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was running around at half a frame a second, like shooting out light projectiles and looking at dynamic lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4541" target="_blank">01:15:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like, someday computers will be fast enough for this, but not today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4545" target="_blank">01:15:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I made a non-real-time version that precalculates all the lighting and realized, oh, wait, if you've precalculated the shadowing in an object, you can still apply the lighting dynamically as long as the light's not moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could do torch flickering with shadows and, you know, figure out all the cases of dynamic and static lighting that were actually practical on a computer at the time and expose them to artists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4564" target="_blank">01:16:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was the wonderful thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

every day they'd find, like, a dropdown with some more lighting options available to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4574" target="_blank">01:16:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'd start using them, and they'd do things that I never thought possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4577" target="_blank">01:16:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was always the coolest thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4579" target="_blank">01:16:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">As a programmer building an engine, you might think you know the implications of the feature you're building, but artists are so clever that you'll always find that you've built the capability of doing vastly more than you ever anticipated as they start to use combinations of features together in concert to do ever more amazing things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4596" target="_blank">01:16:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the genius of artists, is they're given constraints, and within those constraints, they create something you could have never possibly imagined, given the constraints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4605" target="_blank">01:16:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's such a beautiful

<span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4612" target="_blank">01:16:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4628" target="_blank">01:17:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned fog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you even do fog?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4632" target="_blank">01:17:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So you mentioned Unreal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4634" target="_blank">01:17:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first version had fog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4636" target="_blank">01:17:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4636" target="_blank">01:17:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's a funny thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4637" target="_blank">01:17:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this graphics hardware company had just started up in Finland, and they released a screenshot of what their GPU was doing, and they showed a scene filled with volumetric fog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4648" target="_blank">01:17:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So you had a foggy room with some light sources in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4651" target="_blank">01:17:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And when that happens in the real world, what you see are glows around the lights as the light brightens the fog around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4658" target="_blank">01:17:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But the brightening of the fog diminishes over time because the fog absorbs some lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4661" target="_blank">01:17:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the further you get away from the light, the more falloff there is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4667" target="_blank">01:17:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we have a bunch of colored lights overlapping together in a space like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4670" target="_blank">01:17:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The effect is just absolutely magical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4672" target="_blank">01:17:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like being out on a foggy light with street lamps above.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4675" target="_blank">01:17:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something that's surreal and just beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4678" target="_blank">01:17:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like, oh, my God, they figured out how to do real-time volumetric fog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4681" target="_blank">01:18:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to figure it out myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4682" target="_blank">01:18:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was another, like, 30-hour coding session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4685" target="_blank">01:18:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, at the core, I realized, okay, what's happening here is we have this lighting function saying that light at a particular point in space is, like, you know, falling off with the inverse square of the light, the distance from the light source, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4701" target="_blank">01:18:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The inverse square is all from Isaac Newton, which applies to lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4706" target="_blank">01:18:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">What I had to realize was that the way the fog interacted with the light was that you calculate the view from your eye's position to a point on a surface in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4713" target="_blank">01:18:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going through fog, and you're accumulating more and more light as a function of the amount of light illuminating the fog at that point in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4720" target="_blank">01:18:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, well, you know, I'd studied that in mechanical engineering without even knowing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4726" target="_blank">01:18:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the line integral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4727" target="_blank">01:18:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you have an integral over a line of some function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4729" target="_blank">01:18:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this is exactly what it's for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4731" target="_blank">01:18:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's for accumulating values of a function over a continuous space and time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4735" target="_blank">01:18:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I did a bunch of math and realized that, oh, wow, the integral, and I looked in a reference book of all of the integrals, and, you know, thankfully people had solved them all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realized the integral of, you know, this transformed one over r squared turns out to be solved by the arc tangent of r.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4752" target="_blank">01:19:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, if you calculate some parameters based on the position of the eye and the position of the surface point you're ultimately seeing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4762" target="_blank">01:19:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">then you calculate exactly how much fog you can accumulate from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4765" target="_blank">01:19:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, of course, you can't do that per pixel because that's hundreds of cycles of CPU time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4770" target="_blank">01:19:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we had to do is calculate volumetric fog on something equivalent to a light map,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4775" target="_blank">01:19:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but calculating fog every square meter in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4780" target="_blank">01:19:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, we had enough performance for that, built volumetric lighting and gave it to the artists,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4785" target="_blank">01:19:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and they started building magically detailed levels with volumetric fog in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4790" target="_blank">01:19:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, decades later, I was talking to one of the engineers who'd worked on that hardware</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4795" target="_blank">01:19:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and asked about their volumetric fog and told him how it inspired me to, you know, figure out how to do it in real time myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4802" target="_blank">01:20:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He was like, oh, no, we cheated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4804" target="_blank">01:20:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We just rendered it out of 3D Studio Max.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

smoke and mirrors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4817" target="_blank">01:20:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you actually made it happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4819" target="_blank">01:20:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's so

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4978" target="_blank">01:22:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something like 100,000 times higher CPU performance between multiple cores and higher clock rates and more parallelism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4985" target="_blank">01:23:05.540</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4993" target="_blank">01:23:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly, and in graphics, it's been even more so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=4998" target="_blank">01:23:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something like literally 10 million times more net usable GPU

target="_blank">01:23:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it's really made me appreciate that over the generations, some areas of our engine development have absolutely kept up with that technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5017" target="_blank">01:23:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the rendering team that works on Unreal Engine are the real miracle workers there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5023" target="_blank">01:23:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just about every generation of Unreal, we've replaced most of the rendering code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5030" target="_blank">01:23:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the different leaders and different points in time and the different luminaries have built systems that were absolutely rethought and optimized for the latest generation of hardware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5041" target="_blank">01:24:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Unreal Engine 1 was built for software rendering, and then the Voodoo 1 came along late in the cycle, and we had support for it, but it wasn't fully capable and utilized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5052" target="_blank">01:24:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Unreal Engine 2 was about bringing all of the latest GPU hardware acceleration features to the engine and, you know, keeping forward and building some new features like vehicles and a few other capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5063" target="_blank">01:24:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was in the early GPU era, before GPUs had really broken out of, you know, everybody's expectations and more as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5073" target="_blank">01:24:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But that breakout occurred with DirectX 9 and the capabilities of, you know, programmable shaders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5079" target="_blank">01:24:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you had control of writing code running on the GPU that could color every pixel on the screen, and that GPU code was literally a factor of 100 times faster than the equivalent code I wrote a few years earlier in the Pentium 90.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5093" target="_blank">01:24:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that DirectX 9 generation was a godsend, and Andrew Scheiderker, a long-time epic luminary, wrote the core of the Unreal Engine 3 render around real-time pixel shading, real-time lighting, being able to do dynamic shadows using several different techniques,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5112" target="_blank">01:25:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and multi-thread the render to support bits of, you know, the early dual-core CPUs that were starting to show up at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5123" target="_blank">01:25:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a massive, massive graphical upgrade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5125" target="_blank">01:25:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Unreal Engine 4 made a number of improvements and just continued to add features to make more and more, give artists more and more options for lighting and for geometry that created realism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5137" target="_blank">01:25:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But then I think probably our biggest single level of leap came with Unreal Engine 5, with Nanite micropolygon geometry solution, and with Lumen, the global illumination lighting solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5152" target="_blank">01:25:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Which I think really bridged the gap from, you know, game-ish computer graphics to, you know, total observable photorealism for artists who wanted to create that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5164" target="_blank">01:26:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's been the evolution, and the progress on the graphics side is absolutely astonishing, as it is on the audio side and a number of other areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5173" target="_blank">01:26:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But parts of the engine also haven't changed all that much since the version I wrote and shipped in 1998.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5179" target="_blank">01:26:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the file management system has been optimized a number of times, but it hasn't been completely rethought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5187" target="_blank">01:26:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And the networking system, the ways that clients and servers talk together and negotiate game state, is still an evolution of the thing I wrote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5196" target="_blank">01:26:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it's feeling kind of dated now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5199" target="_blank">01:26:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You still see networking bugs in Fortnite, where, like, for some reason, when you're spectating, you're not seeing some parameters update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5205" target="_blank">01:26:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's because of the lossful nature of that networking model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5209" target="_blank">01:26:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, and the biggest limitation that's built up over time is the single-threaded nature of game simulation in Unreal Engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5218" target="_blank">01:26:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We run a single-threaded simulation, you know, if you have a 16-core CPU, we're using one core for game simulation and running with the complicated game logic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5226" target="_blank">01:27:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">because single-thread programming is orders of magnitude easier than multi-thread programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5230" target="_blank">01:27:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we didn't want to burden either ourselves or our partners or the community with the complications of multi-threading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5238" target="_blank">01:27:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, over time, that becomes an increasing limitation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5242" target="_blank">01:27:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so we're really thinking about and working on the next generation of technology and, you know, being Unreal Engine 6.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5249" target="_blank">01:27:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the generation we're actually going to go and address a number of the really core limitations that have been with us over the history of Unreal Engine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5256" target="_blank">01:27:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and get those on the, you know, a better foundation that, you know, the modern world deserves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5262" target="_blank">01:27:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">given everything that's been learned in the field of computing in that time frame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5266" target="_blank">01:27:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a terrifyingly challenging engineering problem.</span></div><div

amazing teams behind it are willing to just throw away most of the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5279" target="_blank">01:27:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe I'm being a little bit too dramatic, but basically throw away the old approaches, like you mentioned with Carmack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5288" target="_blank">01:28:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And start again, like with Nanite and Lumen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5292" target="_blank">01:28:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Just keep optimizing to the current hardware, but even like rethinking how it's all done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5299" target="_blank">01:28:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But going from single-threaded to multi-threaded, oh boy, that's terrifying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5304" target="_blank">01:28:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's in part, we'll talk about it, why maybe you have to rethink even the programming language that's being used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5311" target="_blank">01:28:31.300</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">it's hard to actually identify the individual components of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5465" target="_blank">01:31:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing that's happening here that's really critical—oh, yeah, now we're seeing it being turned off—is the lighting happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5471" target="_blank">01:31:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The Lumen lighting system that's powering the scene is doing different kinds of lighting calculations at different scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5479" target="_blank">01:31:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was the work of Daniel Wright following a decade of moving the state-of-the-art of lighting forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5486" target="_blank">01:31:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But his theory, which was rather controversial at the time, was that if you have enough levels of lighting calculation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5496" target="_blank">01:31:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">then you can get everything—global illumination working everywhere from the absolute highest levels of a scene,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5503" target="_blank">01:31:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that buildings are casting cracked shadows all the way down to details like you see on the dirt here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5508" target="_blank">01:31:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">all working in concert and without distinguishable boundaries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5512" target="_blank">01:31:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is a good decade of foundational work there to make the lighting work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5516" target="_blank">01:31:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">In particular, when you see the very detailed shadows interplaying between the ice and the dirt there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5524" target="_blank">01:32:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that's screen space lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5526" target="_blank">01:32:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's actually shadow calculation going on, not based on the world, but on the pixels on the screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5535" target="_blank">01:32:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because that is the only way that we could possibly do those calculations fast enough, running them in a pixel shader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5541" target="_blank">01:32:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, watch this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5542" target="_blank">01:32:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Watch the—when you add the objects, when you add the textures, the different layering, all the shadows that have to be computed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5549" target="_blank">01:32:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5550" target="_blank">01:32:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Boy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5551" target="_blank">01:32:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That shadowing's an amazing thing, but, you know, the reason that works is counterintuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5557" target="_blank">01:32:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">When somebody first explained it to me, I was like, that's really clever, but I don't think that will work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5561" target="_blank">01:32:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5562" target="_blank">01:32:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But it does work, because if you observe the positions of incoming lights and you know the z-coordinates of the different pixels on the screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5570" target="_blank">01:32:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you can figure out how geometry there is likely to occlude other geometry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5575" target="_blank">01:32:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And even though it's only an approximation and that isn't perfect, it looks perfectly good to the human eye</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5581" target="_blank">01:33:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and gives you the subtle shadowing that you see in a scene like this that makes it look highly realistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5588" target="_blank">01:33:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And the shadowing influences other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5591" target="_blank">01:33:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also some really interesting things happening with the color here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5594" target="_blank">01:33:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not even sure what's causing—you know, it looks like color is bleeding from some parts of the snow onto other parts of the snow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5602" target="_blank">01:33:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like there's some subsurface scattering going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5605" target="_blank">01:33:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not even sure if that's being used in this scene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5608" target="_blank">01:33:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a material layering system for laying down, you know, layers of material, dirt and snow and other things, all making that work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5618" target="_blank">01:33:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the light bouncing off of the geometry, which is another system for lighting on top of the global illumination system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5627" target="_blank">01:33:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">What about reflections, too?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5628" target="_blank">01:33:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that count as the light bouncing off of stuff to light it up in different interesting ways?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5635" target="_blank">01:33:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But then there's also actual literal reflections in, like, we're looking at a puddle in the dirt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5641" target="_blank">01:34:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5642" target="_blank">01:34:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the engine supports a number of different reflection techniques.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5645" target="_blank">01:34:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">One is calculating basically textures that capture all the lighting in the scene and then bouncing that off of texture maps so you can see different lights bouncing off of different pixels in different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5658" target="_blank">01:34:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's individual lighting casting reflections off of things, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5662" target="_blank">01:34:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of this is under the control of designers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5664" target="_blank">01:34:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, one of the things that's a yet-to-do problem for the future is you don't just, like, press a few buttons and this kind of scene magically appears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5673" target="_blank">01:34:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a lot of work from some highly skilled people, not only building out this particular scene, but in setting up the material layers so that you get the dirt with the ice layered on top and all the reflections working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5684" target="_blank">01:34:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And they need to make a number of technical art decisions to make this work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5687" target="_blank">01:34:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And if a novice who hadn't, you know, worked very hard built a kind of scene like this, it wouldn't look nearly as good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5693" target="_blank">01:34:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the challenges we have is to make building this kind of quality level even easier and more seamless and automatic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5700" target="_blank">01:35:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You'd like to just build a scene and say, use this material here and have this appearance come out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5704" target="_blank">01:35:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5706" target="_blank">01:35:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I mean, once you create the scene, you could do things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5709" target="_blank">01:35:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember where they said, like, can you turn off the headlights?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5712" target="_blank">01:35:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I forget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5714" target="_blank">01:35:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You could control the lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5716" target="_blank">01:35:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, all of this, we should say, like, this is dynamic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5720" target="_blank">01:35:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could change the position of the light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5722" target="_blank">01:35:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You could turn on the lights and off the lights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5725" target="_blank">01:35:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5728" target="_blank">01:35:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The geometry, the lighting, the textures, all of it, real-time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5734" target="_blank">01:35:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the power of awesome technical art, three decades of feature development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5740" target="_blank">01:35:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, you have to give credit also to the 20 teraflops of graphics performance that NVIDIA is delivering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5758" target="_blank">01:35:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5759" target="_blank">01:35:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the other things that they talk about in the presentation is about snow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5763" target="_blank">01:36:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to, if you're talking about 1943 in Nazi Germany in the winter, you know, there's a, you have to create a feeling, one of which is the season, the winter, the cold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5777" target="_blank">01:36:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can control the, you know, you have to cover everything in snow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5781" target="_blank">01:36:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And here shown is the ability to control how much snow covers the objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5787" target="_blank">01:36:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So this, that, you know, the ability to do that for the artist is incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5793" target="_blank">01:36:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, just to control how much snow is in the scene dynamically like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5798" target="_blank">01:36:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5800" target="_blank">01:36:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5800" target="_blank">01:36:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5801" target="_blank">01:36:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a cool system for material layering and a dozen pieces coming together here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5805" target="_blank">01:36:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You also notice, you know, there's fogginess and there's some hot objects emanating fog, you know, an artist did that, that, that didn't just arise automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5813" target="_blank">01:36:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's called material layering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5816" target="_blank">01:36:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So an artist creates the different materials and are able to, uh, like layer the scene with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5822" target="_blank">01:37:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

of each material should be, uh, protruding in different places with the engine handling transitions and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5830" target="_blank">01:37:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's on top of the sort of the geometry that creates, that creates the structure of the scene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5835" target="_blank">01:37:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And all the occlusions that have to be computed, I mean, okay, I got to go to the other one that was just blowing my mind, which is, uh, smoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5843" target="_blank">01:37:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5846" target="_blank">01:37:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

smoke and the, the, the shadows, the lighting and the shadows interplaying on the smoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5864"

target="_blank">01:37:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there's a really powerful particle system underneath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5877" target="_blank">01:37:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's providing the, the technological foundations for this sort of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5881" target="_blank">01:38:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's our awesome artistry on top of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5884" target="_blank">01:38:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, uh, and an awesome physics engine powering it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5887" target="_blank">01:38:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's hard to tell exactly which piece is doing what.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5890" target="_blank">01:38:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but you have several different particle systems there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5893" target="_blank">01:38:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There's one for the, um, fire and then there's another one for the smoke coming out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5898" target="_blank">01:38:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the really interesting thing happening with the smoke here is that it's occluding light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5903" target="_blank">01:38:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's calculation of how the light should diminish as it travels through smoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5907" target="_blank">01:38:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're seeing the lighting on the smoke being the really interesting thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5910" target="_blank">01:38:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there've been a lot of attempts, but this is, this was the first demo where I felt, felt like this kind of smoke had really no longer looked like a video game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5921" target="_blank">01:38:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it looked like just, you know, a burning trash can, uh, billowing out dark smoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5925" target="_blank">01:38:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, uh, yeah, it's the, it's the artist, the sophistication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5930" target="_blank">01:38:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's a very, very, very large part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5934" target="_blank">01:38:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, again, it's the interplay between the tooling and the, and the, and the artists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5938" target="_blank">01:38:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, like that, I could, I could watch that for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5942" target="_blank">01:39:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's, there's something magical, uh, sitting around a fire in, in real life and just watching the fire and the smoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5950" target="_blank">01:39:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, humans have been doing that for, I don't know, um, hundreds of thousands of years, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5956" target="_blank">01:39:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and then that same, I was, I was just staring at that and, uh, I wish the people would just stop talking and I could just watch the fire infinitely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5966" target="_blank">01:39:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that, I mean, that's immersion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5968" target="_blank">01:39:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like, I want to be in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5969" target="_blank">01:39:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to sit around that trash can with the fire and the smoke and, and watch and maybe warm my, cause I was also feeling cold because of the snow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5977" target="_blank">01:39:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You're like, you really get immersed into the thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5979" target="_blank">01:39:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's so beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5980" target="_blank">01:39:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's true art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5981" target="_blank">01:39:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's true art.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5984" target="_blank">01:39:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5985" target="_blank">01:39:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I got to ask you about the humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5988" target="_blank">01:39:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We, we talked about what's it like to create the scenes, but, you know, creating realistic humans is really tough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5996" target="_blank">01:39:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you speak to that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=5997" target="_blank">01:39:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">How to create ultra realistic humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6001" target="_blank">01:40:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have an actor behind this to convey emotion, show the nuances and the details of the faces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6008" target="_blank">01:40:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe this is a good opportunity to also mention meta human creator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6012" target="_blank">01:40:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">That's part of unreal engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6013" target="_blank">01:40:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6014" target="_blank">01:40:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Humans are by far the hardest part of computer graphics because millions of years of evolution have given us dedicated brain systems to detect patterns and faces and infer emotions and intent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6027" target="_blank">01:40:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Because cavemen had to, uh, when they see a stranger determine whether they were likely friendly or they were, might be trying to kill them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6033" target="_blank">01:40:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so humans, we people in the world have extraordinarily detailed expectations of a face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6041" target="_blank">01:40:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can notice imperfections, um, especially perfections arising from computer graphics limitations, but it becomes by far the hardest problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6049" target="_blank">01:40:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So the meta humans effort is part of a decades long initiative that Vlad Mostilovich, the most talented digital humans visionary in the world has been working on for generations and generations of games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6063" target="_blank">01:41:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, serving, uh, uh, uh, individual clients around the game industry for a while and then joining Epic as part of the three lateral team and, uh, leading now a worldwide effort to build all of the technologies required to make digital humans realistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6077" target="_blank">01:41:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6078" target="_blank">01:41:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">One part is capturing humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6079" target="_blank">01:41:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it felt really advanced dedicated hardware that puts a human in a capture sphere with dozens of cameras in them taking high resolution, high frame rate video of them as they go through a range of motions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6091" target="_blank">01:41:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then capturing the human face is complicated because the nuanced detail of our faces and how all the muscles and sinews and fat work together to give us different expressions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6100" target="_blank">01:41:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not only about the shape of a person's face, but it's also about the entire range of motion that they might go through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6106" target="_blank">01:41:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Capturing one human requires, uh, you know, a few hours of capture work in a decade environment like that, then, um, thousands of hours of processing work to capture a precise and, you know, real time replicatable version of that human in, in the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6122" target="_blank">01:42:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one of the things that it's done is just capturing an actor or actress in the real world and then using them in a video game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6128" target="_blank">01:42:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but the much more interesting thing going on is capturing thousands of humans to form a data data set whose goal is to encompass the entire range of faces in all of humanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6137" target="_blank">01:42:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, you know, going around every culture, every continent, every age and every face, a variety, uh, and capturing representative people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6145" target="_blank">01:42:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so the entire range of faces is represented, um, and then being able to combine and merge those together, uh, to enable recreating an arbitrary face that the system's never seen before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, you know, one of the ideas is capture, uh, giant amounts of this high precision data and then you use it to reconstruct, uh, a face, uh, at a consumer level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6166" target="_blank">01:42:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like maybe, you know, take an iPhone photo of somebody's face and then capture a very accurate depiction of that, not by synthesizing it then and there on that device, but by combining all of the known details of human faces to accurately capture the most accurate representation of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6181" target="_blank">01:43:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the data problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6183" target="_blank">01:43:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of other problems of computer graphics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6185" target="_blank">01:43:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's technology for rendering hair, which is really hard because you can't render every, like, again, we know the laws of physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6191" target="_blank">01:43:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be easy to just render every hair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6193" target="_blank">01:43:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It would just be a billion times too slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6194" target="_blank">01:43:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so you need approximations that capture the net effect of hair on rendering and on pixels, uh, without calculating every single interaction of every light with every strand of hair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6205" target="_blank">01:43:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, that's one part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6207" target="_blank">01:43:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">There's detailed features for different parts of faces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6209" target="_blank">01:43:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">There's subsurface scattering because we think of humans as opaque, but really our skin is light travels through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6216" target="_blank">01:43:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not completely opaque.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6218" target="_blank">01:43:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way in which light travels through skin has a huge impact on our appearance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6222" target="_blank">01:43:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this is why you, there's no way you can paint a mannequin to look realistic for a human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6225" target="_blank">01:43:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you know, it's just a solid surface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6228" target="_blank">01:43:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and we'll never have the sort of detail you see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6231" target="_blank">01:43:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We should actually just linger on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6234" target="_blank">01:43:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">That kind of blew my mind, like thinking through that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6236" target="_blank">01:43:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I heard that sort of the oiliness of the skin creates very specific, nuanced, complex reflections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6247" target="_blank">01:44:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then some light is absorbed and travels through the skin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6251" target="_blank">01:44:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And that creates, would it be fair to say like micro shadows or something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6255" target="_blank">01:44:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It creates like textures that are humanized, able to perceive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6259" target="_blank">01:44:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it creates the thing that we consider human, whatever that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

this kind of complexity in even just the lighting of a face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6322" target="_blank">01:45:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6323" target="_blank">01:45:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Getting faces right requires the interplay of literally dozens of different systems and aspects of computer graphics.</span></div><div

drawn to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6334" target="_blank">01:45:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And you find it on the

level of perfection needed in this area is vastly, vastly higher than world rendering or grass or any of these other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:46:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you speak more to the creation of digital humans with MetaHuman, both on the editor side and sort of bringing it to life side?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6368" target="_blank">01:46:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems like, because I've watched a bunch of videos, a bunch of individual developers doing it, it's not too difficult to bring a human to life using the tooling that Unreal Engine Editor provides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6384" target="_blank">01:46:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two main tools, you know, compared to the old days where every face was created by hand by an artist from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6391" target="_blank">01:46:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One is the MetaHuman Creator tool for creating faces, where you have a huge number of parameters you can adjust to create a unique human by adjusting all the different capabilities of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6402" target="_blank">01:46:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You can then get that out of MetaHuman Creator into Unreal Engine, and then you can add all kinds of computer graphics features that are in the engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6411" target="_blank">01:46:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You could add clothing using the cloth simulation system, and you can adjust the hair and all these other parameters on the thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6418" target="_blank">01:46:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's MetaHuman Animator, a tool for animating a human based on a facial capture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6424" target="_blank">01:47:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which can be done on a device as simple as like an iPhone, and transfers the captured animation to the human you want, which is not straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6432" target="_blank">01:47:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">If the actor has one face shape and the character on screen has another face shape, the translation that needs to be done from the actor to the face is actually really sophisticated and non-obvious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6441" target="_blank">01:47:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you just applied it literally, then it would be completely wrong from your point of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6446" target="_blank">01:47:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are the main tools that people are using now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6449" target="_blank">01:47:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then within the Unreal Engine, then you have a face and you can do absolutely anything you want to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6454" target="_blank">01:47:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could also, you know, if you decide to go outside of the MetaHuman Geometry Pipeline, you could build your own face, like any creature of any sort, and then use the animation tools to animate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6464" target="_blank">01:47:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, this is 30 years into a project that's probably like 50 years in total to get to absolute photorealism and controllability for absolutely everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6473" target="_blank">01:47:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's vast amounts of work still to do, and we don't feel like we've solved the problem at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6479" target="_blank">01:47:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We've just given artists a big productivity multiplier and a quality multiplier, but this is not in a state that we would say is done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6486" target="_blank">01:48:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But nevertheless, I've seen people use it really effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6489" target="_blank">01:48:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw almost like plugins, maybe external services, where you can get the faces to approximate the mouth movements required to speak a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6499" target="_blank">01:48:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So like that's a really useful feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6504" target="_blank">01:48:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6505" target="_blank">01:48:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">When you have an artist or actor in your studio and you're recording a specific performance, you can just capture their facial motion and apply it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6511" target="_blank">01:48:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But if all you have is a voice recording or you're generating a voice recording or it's parametric or procedural or AI generated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6518" target="_blank">01:48:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, then you need the system to translate that speech not only to movement of the mouth and lips, but also to facial expressions and the whole intent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6526" target="_blank">01:48:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">When we're speaking, it's our whole face that's active and emoting in different ways and it's not just a mechanical motion of the pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6534" target="_blank">01:48:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we spoke a bit about the magic behind the virtualized geometry system, but can you speak a little bit to Lumen and in general what it takes to dynamically light in all the complicated ways, the faces, the scenes that we discussed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6550" target="_blank">01:49:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some interesting things to you that made the magic of it happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6554" target="_blank">01:49:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Lumen is a system for global illumination, meaning it's supposed to calculate the interaction of light with the entire scene in a way that mimics reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6565" target="_blank">01:49:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The first generation of engines that did lighting just said, well, the light casts light and the surfaces it hits are lit and the surfaces it doesn't directly hit are dark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6574" target="_blank">01:49:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just all the techniques we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6576" target="_blank">01:49:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'd have an area that wasn't hit by any light being completely black.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6581" target="_blank">01:49:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But in reality, light bounces around the entire scene dynamically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6585" target="_blank">01:49:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">When a light hits a red wall, then most of the blue and green light is absorbed, but the red light reflects off and now is hitting other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6594" target="_blank">01:49:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you have a red wall with a white floor, light is bouncing off of the red wall into the floor and now the floor is being turned red.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6602" target="_blank">01:50:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the entire bouncing of light around the scene through multiple bounces is the critical challenge to solve here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6608" target="_blank">01:50:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, laws of physics are known.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6611" target="_blank">01:50:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the complete solution to this was written down in the 1950s, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6616" target="_blank">01:50:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The real magic here in Lumen is the system that Daniel Wright developed over the course of many years based on ideas formed over a longer period of time to calculate the way lighting bounces around at different scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6630" target="_blank">01:50:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Ranging from, you know, the scale of miles or kilometers down to the scale of pixels and millimeters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6637" target="_blank">01:50:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And to not only calculate it at each level, but integrate it seamlessly at each level to give the appearance of completely seamless and accurate lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6646" target="_blank">01:50:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And previous techniques were highly specialized and artists had to make a decision for each light about exactly what it did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6652" target="_blank">01:50:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The goal, you know, and a lot of the practice with the light now is you build a scene, you place lights in it and it just works to make it that much easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6661" target="_blank">01:51:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, we're watching, so I'd recommend people go to this blog post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6665" target="_blank">01:51:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, look at

should say that so there's the indoors and the outdoors and to be able to dynamically compute the impact of outdoor light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6678" target="_blank">01:51:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Just the lighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the real world goes through a lot of bounces and the effects of it are very, very subtle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6695"

wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=6701" target="_blank">01:51:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's the lack of the subtle

down and distinguish them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7538" target="_blank">02:05:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of people, like, the theories that get the biggest traction on social media often don't capture the real underlying motive forces at play there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7548" target="_blank">02:05:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, I think AI involved in code production will probably create a net benefit for the need for humanity to be involved in coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7556" target="_blank">02:05:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It may change parts of jobs, but I don't think it's going to obsolete anybody who's willing to learn new ways of doing things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7563" target="_blank">02:06:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's always been this way, and I think that there's also a lot of overhype in AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7568" target="_blank">02:06:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">AI is really great at spewing out code that does something that a million GitHub repositories already do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7573" target="_blank">02:06:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's kind of learned the underlying pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7575" target="_blank">02:06:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's notoriously hard to get to do something new that hasn't been done before,

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7589" target="_blank">02:06:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the problem with code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7590" target="_blank">02:06:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like 99% works, but the 1% might be harder to get to 100% with AI than with hand coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7597" target="_blank">02:06:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And everybody who's looking at this topic should actually try using the coding assistants on hard problems and see how they do there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7603" target="_blank">02:06:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think it, for me personally, it makes it more fun and faster to generate boilerplate code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7609" target="_blank">02:06:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can focus on the harder decisions, harder big picture decisions, and harder innovative decisions, and all that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7616" target="_blank">02:06:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just makes programming more fun for me, because I feel less lonely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7621" target="_blank">02:07:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

like, oh, okay, well, that's a way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7631" target="_blank">02:07:11.200</a></span> | <span

you could talk to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7633" target="_blank">02:07:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe that shows something about the programming experience that it is, in part, sometimes a bit lonely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7640" target="_blank">02:07:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The topic of boilerplate code is an interesting one, because, like, the mere existence of boilerplate code is a failure of programming language and of the idea of creating software modules, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7651" target="_blank">02:07:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you ask AI to create a sorting function, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7654" target="_blank">02:07:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you have another sorting function that might be buggy alongside the million others that different people have written.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7659" target="_blank">02:07:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be better to have a sorting function that's been written and tested and optimized and everybody relies on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7664" target="_blank">02:07:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And more modular software, I think, will actually reduce the opportunity of AI, because, you know, people doing programming work will largely be solving unique problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7674" target="_blank">02:07:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're actually hard problems in themselves and not just connecting other widgets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7678" target="_blank">02:07:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7679" target="_blank">02:07:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, as in many cases, AI will just help improve the human systems by shining a mirror to ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7686" target="_blank">02:08:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to apologize for the pothead question ahead of time, but you've been, let's talk about the metaverse broadly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7693" target="_blank">02:08:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You've been a big proponent of the idea of the metaverse.</span></div><div

we've been talking about simulating reality better and better and better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7705" target="_blank">02:08:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the pothead question is, what does it take to simulate reality to the level we see around us today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7713" target="_blank">02:08:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">How far away from that are we to simulate this ultra-realistic, immersive, fun reality that Earth is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7723" target="_blank">02:08:43.800</a></span> | <span

going to get shockingly close over the coming years, certainly less than 20 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7730" target="_blank">02:08:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at the progress, what areas where we have achieved total photorealism and what areas where we fall short, we're getting very close in all non-human interactions you see in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7740" target="_blank">02:09:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Walking through a jungle or a city, all the lighting, it's very close, and that might be just a few years away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7747" target="_blank">02:09:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But then all of the problems that involve humans, human dialogue and intent, have a much, much, much higher bar that they need to meet to satisfy our brains and convince us that they're realistic or real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7759" target="_blank">02:09:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's going to be the primary challenge of graphics development and simulation development over the coming decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7767" target="_blank">02:09:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So the realistic humans, that's going to be the bottom line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7770" target="_blank">02:09:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and visual and behavior too, so everything?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7775" target="_blank">02:09:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I was asked about this about 10 years ago, and I said that even if you gave us an infinite amount of computing power, we couldn't simulate realistic humans because we simply don't have the algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7785" target="_blank">02:09:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We have no idea how to simulate human intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span

anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7793" target="_blank">02:09:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What we're seeing with generative text AI is not only at a level that you could say that it's actually doing a pretty good job of simulating humans at the text level, not at the emotional level yet, but at least at the level of words spoken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7808" target="_blank">02:10:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And find more

inextricably heading in that way, and it's heading at a shocking, shocking rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7826" target="_blank">02:10:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we don't say this enough, but the current state of LLMs, I mean, if you put Alan Turing in conversation with Chad GPT, I mean, it really passes the Turing test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7839" target="_blank">02:10:39.960</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7846" target="_blank">02:10:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the Turing test is not a real test, it's not a useful test, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7848" target="_blank">02:10:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We just keep raising the bar

target="_blank">02:12:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a system of equations, you know, such as the laws of physics, then all possible evolutions of dynamical systems under those equations kind of have a physical reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7984" target="_blank">02:13:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just are kind of a manifestation of laws of math rather than needing an actual universe around us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7991" target="_blank">02:13:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7992" target="_blank">02:13:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I like dabbling in that philosophy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=7994" target="_blank">02:13:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we get CAI becoming smarter and smarter, and we get closer and closer to really capturing the full laws of physics, these questions become quite a lot more compelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8002" target="_blank">02:13:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you start to think, if we're not living in a simulation, what are the things about this reality that are not simulatable?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8010" target="_blank">02:13:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are the big mysteries around us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8013" target="_blank">02:13:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels like the physics is simulatable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8016" target="_blank">02:13:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels like a lot of the incredible stuff that we talked about, while super nice, seems simulatable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8023" target="_blank">02:13:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But then there's the flame of consciousness, the feeling of it, whatever that is that lights up in our eyes as humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8031" target="_blank">02:13:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe that's not simulatable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8033" target="_blank">02:13:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe that's a thread that connects to the explanation of the mechanism, as you said, of the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8040" target="_blank">02:14:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really important to understand, and we're completely clueless about that mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8044" target="_blank">02:14:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, a lot of the religious texts sneak up on what that mechanism is, but we're still mostly clueless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8052" target="_blank">02:14:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll only have these, like, leaps of faith and believing what that mechanism might be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8055" target="_blank">02:14:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, the whole idea of nested simulations, perhaps, you know, given a sufficiently advanced technology, is kind of mooted, such that if you wanted to simulate another reality, you're kind of just actually creating the reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8068" target="_blank">02:14:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You're doing, you know, quantum mechanical operations that would produce the same result anyway, and you're running them at full performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8077" target="_blank">02:14:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not really a nested simulation, it's just another thing that's happening in the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8082" target="_blank">02:14:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would be interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8084" target="_blank">02:14:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's ultimately a theological question, and because it's no longer cool to deal with theology as part of science, there's not been much work on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8093" target="_blank">02:14:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't publish results on those topics in a respected physics journal, so I think that's kind of been set aside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8100" target="_blank">02:15:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's interesting to note that the laws of quantum mechanics themselves have a place for, you know, God or souls or whatever external source of input you might want to attach to such a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8111" target="_blank">02:15:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that, you know, there's this idea of quantum wave function collapse, that when we, you know, look at a quantum system evolving in perfect superposition of many possibilities, and you go to observe it, you actually just see a specific possibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8124" target="_blank">02:15:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">In a multi-slit experiment, the light ultimately ends up being observed going through one slit or the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8130" target="_blank">02:15:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a place where there's this random number being injected into everything around us, you know, trillions of trillions of trillions of times per second in everything we're observing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8140" target="_blank">02:15:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you want to attach some external input, well, there's a place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8143" target="_blank">02:15:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and it could be seriously accessible through the rigors of science, but we just know so little there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8151" target="_blank">02:15:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8152" target="_blank">02:15:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">In that area, we know nothing more than cavemen knew whatsoever.</span></div><div

have...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8160" target="_blank">02:16:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Computers that may be soon more advanced than we are, but we just don't have any answers to the fundamental questions about life, the universe, and everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8171" target="_blank">02:16:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think, sort of more practically, do you think we'll create video game worlds of the metaverse variety in which humans will want to stay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8188" target="_blank">02:16:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, to me, this kind of discussion of a simulated reality, the real test of immersion is like not wanting to go back to the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8197" target="_blank">02:16:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">As a perfectly healthy, excited, normal human being, choosing to stay in that world, how hard is that, do you think?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8208" target="_blank">02:16:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think the technology is coming, and then there's a human question of should we go that far?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8214" target="_blank">02:16:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Should we, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8216" target="_blank">02:16:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, certainly as a game developer ourselves, Epic doesn't aspire to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8219" target="_blank">02:16:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We make fun games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8220" target="_blank">02:17:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

is fun games that people play together to have fun in between, you know, work and the other things in their real lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8230" target="_blank">02:17:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But as simulations get more and more realistic and the capabilities become more and more real, I think we have to ask ourselves some hard questions about how should humanity operate in that space?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8239" target="_blank">02:17:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the limits that we should go to and what are the limits we should set?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8243" target="_blank">02:17:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think there's going to be some hard questions, and I think maybe I'm just being human-centric here, but there should probably be some legal bounds on two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8257" target="_blank">02:17:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Sort of not creating a reality in which humans would want to stay too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8262" target="_blank">02:17:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Sort of, yeah, focusing more on the game side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8265" target="_blank">02:17:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And more importantly, not creating simulations of humans that could suffer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8276" target="_blank">02:17:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, you know, as we talked about, creating ultra-realistic humans, eventually that means creating humans that can suffer, that can fall in love and experience heartbreak and loss, that can fear death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8292" target="_blank">02:18:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more you assimilate that to the full reality of the human condition, the more you get to this place where you have assimilated humans that is able to suffer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8302" target="_blank">02:18:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, legally speaking, I think you have to get to a place where that's not allowed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8308" target="_blank">02:18:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there is a line you

for humans to deal with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8316" target="_blank">02:18:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8367" target="_blank">02:19:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think the thing to appreciate is, like, game developers have just generally been on the good-spirited side of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8374" target="_blank">02:19:34.700</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8395" target="_blank">02:19:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the thing that all game developers need to remember is, we're here to make people's lives better by entertaining them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8402" target="_blank">02:20:02.060</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8490" target="_blank">02:21:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It really took on a new nature, which was not just like a multiplayer game with heritage from Doom, but also a true social experience between you and your friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8503" target="_blank">02:21:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, Fortnite Battle Royale is just one manifestation of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8506" target="_blank">02:21:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one is, like, Rec Room VR, where you're standing around in VR with friends playing billiards or shooting hoops and are doing other, like, light entertainment things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8514" target="_blank">02:21:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think every game that has a huge number of players who play together socially as part of their, you know, entertainment lives, I think is really getting at the core essence of the, you know, aspiration for the metaverse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8529" target="_blank">02:22:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we're still in the very early days of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8531" target="_blank">02:22:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I was on the internet in, like, 1992 or so, and, you know, it was a pretty bare-bones thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8539" target="_blank">02:22:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think when we look back at the state of gaming today, we'll realize that there's a lot further to go to get to the ultimate version of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8548" target="_blank">02:22:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I think it's all on track, and I think it was the time we released Fortnite Battle Royale and started playing together, all of the people at Epic and squads and experiencing that world, that we realized that this trend was afoot and that we needed to do everything we could to give, to bring in other creators so that anybody could, you know, pile on to the work we were doing by creating their own worlds through Fortnite Creative and UEFN and creating more games and more genres that people could play and ever-expanding the repertoire of fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8577" target="_blank">02:22:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I would love to sort of talk about different aspects of that a little bit more because, you know, Epic has created a lot of amazing games, Unreal Tournament, Gears of War.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8585" target="_blank">02:23:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the game that I think is fair to say that transformed the gaming industry was Fortnite, or Fortnite Battle Royale especially. Can you explain the origin story of Fortnite?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8596" target="_blank">02:23:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Fortnite has humble beginnings. In 2011, we've just been in the final days of finishing one of the Gears of War games, and we wanted to explore ideas for new games, and we had a general idea that we would like to build, you know, some smaller games, online games, in order to learn more about, you know, that space, and not just have one single massive game in production at all times and only one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8625" target="_blank">02:23:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so everybody in the company was given a week to form a team and work with whichever co-workers they wanted and build a game using Unreal Engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8635" target="_blank">02:23:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can actually build something pretty interesting in a week, and one of the teams built the very first version of what became Fortnite. The very first version of it had a different art style, but it had the idea at the core that you're going to build forts by day using this building system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8649" target="_blank">02:24:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Then night would come, and you'd defend the forts against zombies, and, you know, the longer you could go, the more elaborate forts you could build, and the more survival waves you could withstand, and it would get cooler and cooler with time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8660" target="_blank">02:24:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8661" target="_blank">02:24:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, that game was in development for a very long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8664" target="_blank">02:24:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We always saw the potential, just the building aspect of it was incredibly fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8669" target="_blank">02:24:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But we made different pivots at different times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8672" target="_blank">02:24:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">At one point, we moved to the current Fortnite art style, away from kind of more of a realistic style.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8677" target="_blank">02:24:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Made it, you know, more in the Pixar vein of, you know, cool stylized characters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8683" target="_blank">02:24:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">What was that decision like? Because we should mention, Gears of War is this, like, incredible, like, shows off the graphics to the fullest, different than the artistic style of Fortnite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8694" target="_blank">02:24:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's amazing that the same company would make this, like, fun, silly, graphic style of Fortnite, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8701" target="_blank">02:25:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">People come to Epic because they want to work with the best people in the world, and the artists bring a lot of different personal art aspirations and style capabilities, and many of them are very multi-talented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8710" target="_blank">02:25:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It can produce photoreal content or highly stylized content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8713" target="_blank">02:25:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of the best artists on Fortnite were a lot of the best artists on Gears of War, too, changed styles, but continued doing awesome work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8720" target="_blank">02:25:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We'd realized that Fortnite could be really mainstream, and it could be a game people play for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8725" target="_blank">02:25:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so having a, you know, more visually pleasing art style that's, you know, not as stressful as, like, a Call of Duty game, where you're constantly, like, pixel hunting, you know, a dark scene for, you know, somebody's rifle scope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8736" target="_blank">02:25:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That was the goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8738" target="_blank">02:25:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, a few of the artists got through and defined the new art style, and we moved to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8742" target="_blank">02:25:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And at different points, it evolved towards being kind of like a light MMO, like Destiny, with rather complex RPG and stat systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8750" target="_blank">02:25:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that evolved into a, you know, kind of an MMO-like tower defense game, MMO-only in that persistence of items and stats, you know, which became Fortnite's Save the World mode, which we launched in early 2017.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8764" target="_blank">02:26:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a moderate success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8766" target="_blank">02:26:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it paid its budget, and we'd come out ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8769" target="_blank">02:26:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the same time, the Battle Royale genre was booming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8772" target="_blank">02:26:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">PUBG had just come out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8774" target="_blank">02:26:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Tons of people at Epic were playing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8775" target="_blank">02:26:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They were like, oh, this would be so cool if it had Fortnite building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8777" target="_blank">02:26:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we assembled a team in a war room, you know, like 30 people in one big room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8783" target="_blank">02:26:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, they worked insanely hard for four weeks to build Battle Royale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8788" target="_blank">02:26:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So the nice thing is all the content for Fortnite had been built over the previous seven years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8792" target="_blank">02:26:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">They had a huge library of content, but no gameplay of the type they wanted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8795" target="_blank">02:26:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had to build it all in that four weeks and ship it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8798" target="_blank">02:26:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that put Epic on an exponential growth curve where we went from 300 employees to, you know, to thousands of employees and went from about $100 million in revenue to billions of dollars in revenue and, you know, became the center of the gaming world at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8813" target="_blank">02:26:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you actually speak to the technical challenge of going from mostly and not online, large scale gaming platform to being able to support with Battle Royale a huge number of people playing with each other at the same exact time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8832" target="_blank">02:27:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what's the technically four weeks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8834" target="_blank">02:27:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the technical challenges there that had to be overcome?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8836" target="_blank">02:27:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Since 2012, we've been building online backend system to support player accounts and login.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8842" target="_blank">02:27:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, all of the different systems there needed to make a multiplayer game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8846" target="_blank">02:27:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've been building them to be scalable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8848" target="_blank">02:27:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And by some miracle, we built them stably enough that they were able to scale up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8852" target="_blank">02:27:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, so the online team was responsible for patching that code, spent a year of intense work getting it to scale from like 40,000 concurrent users to 15 million concurrent users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8865" target="_blank">02:27:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, there's scaling, there's scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8867" target="_blank">02:27:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8868" target="_blank">02:27:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's immense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8869" target="_blank">02:27:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But they'd done such an awesome job of building the foundations that it was tractable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8875" target="_blank">02:27:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It was doable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8875" target="_blank">02:27:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">If they hadn't done that, then the company would have died.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8879" target="_blank">02:27:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Fortnite just wouldn't have been playable and the whole thing would have failed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8883" target="_blank">02:28:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's just so much detail there that makes all the difference because, I mean, that's what Spotify has talked about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8891" target="_blank">02:28:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, the latency, it's like how quickly you can deliver the song changes the product from being this shitty thing that I'd rather pirate the songs to, like, this is good enough to where I really enjoy the experience and I want to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8908" target="_blank">02:28:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, yeah, that's really important to create an experience for 15 million concurrent users to where they're not, where it's not lagging, where it actually works, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8922" target="_blank">02:28:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there something you could say to the sort of, like, how difficult that is to pull off?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8929" target="_blank">02:28:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the trend nowadays for building online services is microservices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8934" target="_blank">02:28:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not one big server that handles all the interactions with Fortnite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8938" target="_blank">02:28:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There's game servers running 100-player game instances for each Battle Royale session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8944" target="_blank">02:29:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's an account server and many instances of it all talking to a shared database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8949" target="_blank">02:29:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's hundreds of different microservices talking to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8952" target="_blank">02:29:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so scaling is a matter of identifying what are the bottlenecks in that system and making sure that each one can scale and has enough redundancy to be able to handle the load.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8963" target="_blank">02:29:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank God for Amazon Web Services and cloud hosting because Epic went to 15 million concurrent users without buying any server hardware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8973" target="_blank">02:29:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We were able to just call up Amazon and say, we need more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8976" target="_blank">02:29:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a period of time there where Fortnite was undergoing this exponential growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8980" target="_blank">02:29:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'd find, like, one week we ran out of servers in Brazil during a heavy weekend of play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8985" target="_blank">02:29:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And next week we had an even heavier weekend of play and there were servers to handle it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=8990" target="_blank">02:29:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, somebody at Amazon had drop shipped, you know, millions of dollars of server hardware into Brazil and turned it on just in time for Fortnite to need it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9000" target="_blank">02:30:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, there are a lot of unsung heroes in that story, many of them we have never heard of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9004" target="_blank">02:30:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

those folks who run the modern internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9015" target="_blank">02:30:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All the incredible services, the games, the services that we take for granted are currently being run on AWS or were originally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9023" target="_blank">02:30:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Google Cloud and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9025" target="_blank">02:30:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9027" target="_blank">02:30:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you speak to how much money Fortnite made?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9032" target="_blank">02:30:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, like, one of the greatest successes in the history of video games also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9036" target="_blank">02:30:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Fortnite makes billions of dollars a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9038" target="_blank">02:30:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the majority of Epic's revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9042" target="_blank">02:30:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a robust business around Unreal Engine licensing, Rocket League and Fall Guys, and some other tools, like the Fab Content Marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9050" target="_blank">02:30:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the majority of it is Fortnite because we've chosen to reinvest heavily in building what we think is the future of technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9057" target="_blank">02:30:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We're spending more every year than we're making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9060" target="_blank">02:31:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And for a bit of time, we were spending over a billion dollars a year more than we were making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9065" target="_blank">02:31:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found that to be unsustainable, and we went through some painful layoffs at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9071" target="_blank">02:31:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we stabilized, and now we're spending several hundred million dollars a year more than we're making, which we can very well afford to do because we have billions of dollars in the bank, you know, thanks to a combination of the profits we made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9082" target="_blank">02:31:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">When we were a very small company with a very big game, and because of the investment we've raised, we're not an oil well pumping oil out of the ground where we discovered oil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9091" target="_blank">02:31:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We are growing to be a future technology powerhouse, and we think the 3D space and the future real-time 3D simulations is going to be one of the major facets of technology for humanity, and we're all in investing in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9104" target="_blank">02:31:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's exciting to see that investing in a long-term future sort of taking the risk of doing the research and defining the next chapter of Epic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9113" target="_blank">02:31:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So using the successes of the day to invest into the successes of tomorrow that might look very different, like completely different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9120" target="_blank">02:32:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of that is investing in the developments, the research and the innovation in the Unreal Engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9127" target="_blank">02:32:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right. We're a company that can start working on a project knowing that we won't reach fruition or make any money from it at all for three years, four years, five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9138" target="_blank">02:32:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We're totally okay with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9141" target="_blank">02:32:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, that's the cycle that's fueled our growth over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9143" target="_blank">02:32:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's constantly investing in the future and being a serious company that's doing serious R&D side-by-side with shipping and maintaining products and earning money from them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9153" target="_blank">02:32:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So can you speak to, I mean, there's several directions here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9157" target="_blank">02:32:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of them, sort of the future evolution of this idea of the metaverse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9163" target="_blank">02:32:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So potentially creating communities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9167" target="_blank">02:32:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So Fortnite is this incredible, huge community of humans interacting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9174" target="_blank">02:32:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But your vision is to go outside of just one game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9178" target="_blank">02:32:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is the kinds of standards that you're thinking about building such that people can sort of have an identity and almost travel between games and that kind of thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9191" target="_blank">02:33:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me start with the present of gaming and why it sucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9194" target="_blank">02:33:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9196" target="_blank">02:33:16.140</a></span> | <span

thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9198" target="_blank">02:33:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You go into Fortnite, there's, you know, 100 million monthly active users there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9202" target="_blank">02:33:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">A huge number of your own friends are there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9204" target="_blank">02:33:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You can play with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9205" target="_blank">02:33:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Go from experience to experience seamlessly without leaving the app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9208" target="_blank">02:33:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">There are 100,000 different islands you can play on and some of them are really awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9213" target="_blank">02:33:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are constant new ones coming out and constant things to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9216" target="_blank">02:33:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to play Roblox, all right, you quit out of the Fortnite app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9220" target="_blank">02:33:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You launch the Roblox app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9221" target="_blank">02:33:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Different program, different friend system, different account names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9225" target="_blank">02:33:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Your username in Fortnite and your username in Roblox are different names and they're not connected to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9229" target="_blank">02:33:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to remake all your friends and then find different, you know, things to play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9233" target="_blank">02:33:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And now the controls are different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9235" target="_blank">02:33:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to relearn how, you know, the joystick, mouse, keyboard, controller works in that experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9241" target="_blank">02:34:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to go from place to place and you buy some stuff in Fortnite and it's really cool and you can use it anywhere in Fortnite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9245" target="_blank">02:34:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you go in Roblox and you don't have that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9248" target="_blank">02:34:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to buy different stuff.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9251" target="_blank">02:34:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And same with Call of Duty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9252" target="_blank">02:34:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's another isolated place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9253" target="_blank">02:34:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And same with World of Warcraft and same with League of Legends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9257" target="_blank">02:34:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And every other, every place you go is its own unique place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9260" target="_blank">02:34:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Different friends, different account names, different people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9263" target="_blank">02:34:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's no social cohesion between them at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9265" target="_blank">02:34:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And a long time ago, consoles set out to solve this problem by creating their console-wide friend system and account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9272" target="_blank">02:34:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So your friend on PlayStation in one game is your friends on PlayStation in another game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9275" target="_blank">02:34:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But only on PlayStation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9277" target="_blank">02:34:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're on Xbox, you can't see PlayStation friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9279" target="_blank">02:34:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have two basically orthogonal and cross-cutting divisions of the world into fiefdoms, you know, which were not created with bad intentions, but arose and are, you know, separated, isolated islands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9294" target="_blank">02:34:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">One is the platforms and their social services, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Steam, Epic, if you add it to the list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9301" target="_blank">02:35:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other is these different games people play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9303" target="_blank">02:35:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, because of this weird historical artifact, we're left in a world where people can't seamlessly move from games to games bringing their friends and their stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9314" target="_blank">02:35:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So the solution to this is to federate and connect all of the systems together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9319" target="_blank">02:35:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">All of the players on all of the different platforms can be recognized by their name and put the at sign in it so your Xbox names and your Fortnite or Epic names and your Steam names can all live together and interoperate together in a single space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9333" target="_blank">02:35:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So unifying the social ecosystems is one thing that needs to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9336" target="_blank">02:35:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The next and bigger challenge is to unify the economies, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9342" target="_blank">02:35:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm not talking about, like, a sword you have in World of Warcraft should work in Fortnite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9347" target="_blank">02:35:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Every game is going to have its own gameplay rules, and a lot of games are going to have stuff that only works in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9353" target="_blank">02:35:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, there's a huge set of games that have in common the idea of a cosmetic system that does not affect gameplay outcomes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9362" target="_blank">02:36:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but is, you know, purely cool looks and cool appearances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9365" target="_blank">02:36:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the major multiplayer games have them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9371" target="_blank">02:36:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, if you look at games, you could probably bundle together about 70% of them and say they're similar enough that they could actually interoperate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9378" target="_blank">02:36:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You could own an outfit in Fortnite, own an outfit in Roblox, and own the same outfit in maybe Call of Duty, and maybe, you know, 100 or 200 other games and actually expect they would work together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9390" target="_blank">02:36:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And you find other kinds of items are probably underoperable, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9393" target="_blank">02:36:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, Fortnite has car outfits, so you can, you know, buy different appearances of a car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9399" target="_blank">02:36:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you find a physical car in the world of Fortnite, if you're the first person to get into it in that session, boom, it takes on your, you know, your chosen car cosmetic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9408" target="_blank">02:36:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you have a cool car that's identifiable as yours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9411" target="_blank">02:36:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we realized early on with Fortnite that the key to making Fortnite work as a creator economy was to open up the revenue from the item shop to all the sources of engagement, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9423" target="_blank">02:37:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two big things happening in Fortnite that make it work as a product and as a business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9428" target="_blank">02:37:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">One is the game modes, Fortnite Battle Royale and all of the user modes and everything else are sources of engagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9434" target="_blank">02:37:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">People play there because it's super fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

all these sources of engagement, but the sources of engagement don't make money directly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9447"

you've played, you know, 40% of your time in Battle Royale and 60% of your time in these user modes, the money you spent, the portion of that that's profit can be separated out and paid out to all the

it to a gun in Fortnite, but based on the value, some, you know, some generic concept of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9629" target="_blank">02:40:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So the value of a thing in one game versus the value of a thing in another game, where you're almost operating in the, in the, in the space of value versus the actual items, or is that already getting too, um, too general?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9645"

higher specifications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9659" target="_blank">02:40:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, you know, battle royale, uh, is relatively strong in that area, uh, because you see your character from behind and, uh, see all of your other characters from the front and you have lots of opportunities to really see who you are and to emote and to interact with other players.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9677"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9684" target="_blank">02:41:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There was this game that was one of the big breakthroughs in Fortnite, only up it's a game where you just climbing up in the up by, uh, following, uh, paths of stacks of objects and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9693" target="_blank">02:41:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was, uh, just stupid fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

outfits when they were playing only up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9701" target="_blank">02:41:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's kind of intuitive actually, like you're not seeing other players, like if you see anything and like you're, you're seeing their butt as you're like trying to catch up to them, jumping from object to object, um, and they're above you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9711" target="_blank">02:41:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so, you know, it wasn't a mode that showed off outfits very much, but you could, you know, you can determine the economic correlation between, uh, a game mode and spending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9722" target="_blank">02:42:02.180</a></span> | <span

know, you have like gold in the physical space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9872" target="_blank">02:44:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that holds value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9875" target="_blank">02:44:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, how, how, how your outfit looks like in Fortnite that as, as you're saying provably holds value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9882" target="_blank">02:44:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you want to connect like a standard, uh, definition of money value to that and not let it become this hype thing, which NFTs that you mentioned are just become that it's like, it quickly drifts away into the land of when people trying to buy and sell and try to make money versus like staying close.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9905" target="_blank">02:45:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the thing that people actually value, forget the money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9908" target="_blank">02:45:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more about exchanging valuable experiences or things of value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9913" target="_blank">02:45:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can, uh, play Fortnite and then go to an, uh, to another video game and continue the valuable experience and then come back to Fortnite and then do that kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9926" target="_blank">02:45:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're saying this, there might be a way to do that and to, to basically create standards the way the web has different standards for, for displaying websites and all this kind of stuff or the, the, the, the communication that's required on the networking side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9943" target="_blank">02:45:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So all the different standards that make the web work, there need to be those kinds of standards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9948" target="_blank">02:45:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what, what would those, those standards look like to enable the metaverse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9952" target="_blank">02:45:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We need a lot of different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9954" target="_blank">02:45:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the one area where the standards have been very successful in creating working standards implemented by all of the major engines today is in low level file formats for data interchange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9964" target="_blank">02:46:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the web has PNG files for 2d images, um, and MP3 files for audio, uh, and 3d has, uh, the Pixar USD file format, the universal scene description, which is a description of the scene graph, the entire set of objects in the scene and all of their parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9981" target="_blank">02:46:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So that any engine that supports those features could import that and then render the same scene, um, as the engine they came from, you know, large parts of this work across unreal engine and unity and blender.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=9991" target="_blank">02:46:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of these, uh, 3d packages of different sorts, and there's the GLTF texture format, um, which stores textures and geometry and other low level data for 3d objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10002" target="_blank">02:46:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when you see a fortnight character, that file format together with the image file formats can store their static appearance, their, uh, you know, the shape of their body, um, even their animations, um, and their different poses, um, and the appearance of them, the different standard file formats could store their, all of the sounds they make and their emotes, but we're still missing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10021" target="_blank">02:47:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">A bunch of pieces. Um, the biggest missing piece is a programming language that, uh, at the center of standardizing the matter verse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10029" target="_blank">02:47:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, um, if you look at the web, the web is a combination of a bunch of different technologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10034" target="_blank">02:47:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the two biggest ones are HTML, which describes the 2d scene graph or the, you know, 2d layout of controls and objects on the web page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10043" target="_blank">02:47:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but that's just static data. Uh, it's just a non moving, non animating web page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10049" target="_blank">02:47:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have the JavaScript programming language, which is used to manipulate that, to display things to the user and to implement anything you could implement in code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10057" target="_blank">02:47:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a little programming language that runs in your web browser. Um, and the metaverse needs something that performs that similar role, but the metaverse and 3d gaming in general needs something that's rather more powerful, more safe, more scalable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10072" target="_blank">02:47:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And, uh, more capable than JavaScript because the metaverse is actually more difficult technical problem than a web page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10079" target="_blank">02:47:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">A web page like an app is just a single bundle of code and content that somebody, a company has prepared and they release it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10089" target="_blank">02:48:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it stays exactly what it is until they release a new version. And it's upgraded from version to version as it goes. Um, but the metaverse needs to be a comp composite of code and content built by millions of different people, uh, that could potentially form a seamless world together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10104" target="_blank">02:48:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. It's fully distributed collaborative. Uh, first of all, also the, the, the amount of data, I mean, it doesn't have to be that way, but websites are showing very little information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10117" target="_blank">02:48:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the metaverse, uh, the metaverse, even when it, when it looks like something like Fortnite, just the amount of information that's conveyed in the scene graph as the individual players are collaborating is a huge, huge, huge amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10134" target="_blank">02:48:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. The highest detail of Fortnite, uh, updates amount to about 60 gigabytes of data. Um, and you know, that's just a small part of what exists in the Fortnite creative economy. Um, and if you look at what this might be in a decade, uh, as standards emerge, you might have exabytes of data out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10152" target="_blank">02:49:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Fortnite battle Royale is, I don't think the ultimate manifestation of gameplay that will, you know, ever be invented. What we've seen time and time again is that as we gain more technical capabilities, graphics gets more capable, uh, CPU has become more performant, you know, uh, web services become ever more scalable. Um, we see new genres of games that emerged that weren't possible before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10175" target="_blank">02:49:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, Doom ushered in the era of deathmatch and the first time 3d multiplayer game was even possible at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10181" target="_blank">02:49:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the early battle Royale games starting about 10 years or 15 years ago, um, only became possible back then. You couldn't have built one 20 years ago because you just couldn't have rendered an environment that's as large as a VR game with that many players, um, with that level of interaction and performance. It was just not possible to run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10201" target="_blank">02:50:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you got a certain level of technical capabilities and a genre came out that proved to be by far the best shooter genre ever invented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10207" target="_blank">02:50:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think there are numerous, numerous more genres, some of which are better than any of the existing ones that will be invented as we get more and more capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10215" target="_blank">02:50:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, some of the capabilities we're lacking now are the ability to build environments, uh, and game simulations that span more than work than a single company can possibly create.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10227" target="_blank">02:50:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, you see the kind of the birth of that idea in Fortnite and Roblox where there are tens of thousands of creators, each building content and users are playing meaningful amounts of it all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10235" target="_blank">02:50:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's an ecosystem that's scaled larger than company, but it's still very much, you go into one island and you play that creator's work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10242" target="_blank">02:50:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The other direction of its scalability is putting more and more of people's work together in a seamless, continuous play space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10248" target="_blank">02:50:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If for games where that makes sense, you know, you can imagine a, a, a game taking place in an environment that is the size of a continent or earth, um, in which you can go from place to place and then see different areas, which are maintained by different people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10264" target="_blank">02:51:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you go into different spaces, the game rules are customized according to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10268" target="_blank">02:51:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and you can go from experience to experience and instead of having just one company's authorship ever present, wherever you are, you know, you'd see, you'd be driving a car built by one person, carrying weapons built by 20 other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10281" target="_blank">02:51:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, you know, taking place in a simulation and an environment that's built by thousands of other people, uh, you know, working for separate companies or their own entrepreneurs or, uh, Indies or enthusiasts, uh, all working together simultaneously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10296" target="_blank">02:51:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we totally lack the programming foundations for that, uh, you know, the, the kinds of code you would need to write now are, uh, to make that happen are, are just not practical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10305" target="_blank">02:51:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're investing massively in building new programming language technologies around verse and our proposed standards, uh, for, you know, future metaverse programming, uh, that we hope will solve those kinds of problems and make that kind of world possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10320" target="_blank">02:52:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So first of all, that's a super exciting future where, you know, it's not hundreds or thousands, it's millions of creators that can just create different small or big elements of a world as big as earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10337" target="_blank">02:52:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, just, uh, just, uh, just, if you consider close your eyes and imagine that world, that's really exciting where it's not a centralized company controlling the release of a particular island or so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10348" target="_blank">02:52:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's people constantly dynamically modifying all the islands of reality in this digital world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10356" target="_blank">02:52:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, if you could speak to some of the technology that can enable that, you mentioned the verse programming language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10363" target="_blank">02:52:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, also how legit is it for you, CEO of Epic Games to be a co-author?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10371" target="_blank">02:52:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The programming language theorists are losing their mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10374" target="_blank">02:52:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So co-author on a paper that's describing some of the sort of nuanced details of a programming language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10381" target="_blank">02:53:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe you could speak to this programming language called verse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10385" target="_blank">02:53:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a functional logic language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10389" target="_blank">02:53:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10390" target="_blank">02:53:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some cool features of verse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10392" target="_blank">02:53:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse is a programming language that we're building for large scale simulation programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10398" target="_blank">02:53:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's designed to make it easy to write code that can scale up to, uh, not only you building a Fortnite island, but you building modules or components that can be used by millions of other programmers and coexist in a huge environment and also can scale up to a huge scale simulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10418" target="_blank">02:53:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Some games will be small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10419" target="_blank">02:53:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Battle Royale might, might find it, you know, that a hundred players is actually optimal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10424" target="_blank">02:53:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it might be the thousand player version of Battle Royale would be worse, but I bet there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10428" target="_blank">02:53:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">are thousands, million, and tens of million player experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

players together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10442" target="_blank">02:54:02.080</a></span> | <span

language side, uh, can you continue as I rudely interrupt you, uh, talking about verse versus a functional logic language?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10557" target="_blank">02:55:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, because we think that that's the way to make the most simple and powerful language simultaneously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10563" target="_blank">02:56:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, back in the 1970s, the, the programming language designer who built Pascal, one of the early programming languages, uh, uh, my Klaus Wirth or Nicholas Wirth is Americans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10576" target="_blank">02:56:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We might call him, um, um, stated this principle that programming language should achieve, uh, a high degree of power, not by having a lot of features, but having, by having a small number of features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10587" target="_blank">02:56:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That work together, uh, and can be composed together arbitrarily so that you have to learn a relatively small set of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10594" target="_blank">02:56:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, um, the real knowledge comes as you learn ways to combine them to achieve bigger and bigger programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10601" target="_blank">02:56:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, um, you know, there's a long history to the field of programming languages, but in the 1950s, the first programming language designers got together and built the first standardized language called Algol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10612" target="_blank">02:56:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, um, there was this meeting in 1956, very few people even know about, but it's where all the major foundations of modern programming languages were decided on that the C family of languages inherited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10623" target="_blank">02:57:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're very much living in a world that was defined by them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10626" target="_blank">02:57:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And thankfully they got a whole lot of things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10628" target="_blank">02:57:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They defined how functions should work, how variables should work and how recursion should work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10633" target="_blank">02:57:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you know, thank God they got those things right, but they got a few things wrong and versus trying to fix those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10640" target="_blank">02:57:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the functional logic part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10642" target="_blank">02:57:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The interesting thing about functional logic languages is that, um, in an old school language, an expression produces a value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10649" target="_blank">02:57:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, in a functional logic language, an expression can produce zero, one, or multiple values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10654" target="_blank">02:57:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it produces zero values, we might say it fails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10657" target="_blank">02:57:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it produces one value, we say it succeeds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10659" target="_blank">02:57:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it produces multiple values, it's kind of providing a set of values you could iterate over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10664" target="_blank">02:57:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are a bunch of features in today's programming languages that are defined in an ad hoc way without really thinking this through, this zero, one, or many values way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10673" target="_blank">02:57:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the problem that functional logic languages address.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10676" target="_blank">02:57:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the most basic example is an if statement in a programming language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10680" target="_blank">02:58:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If some condition holds, then do this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10683" target="_blank">02:58:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, do that thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10684" target="_blank">02:58:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the language today, uh, this is done with variables of type Boolean or expressions that produce Booleans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10692" target="_blank">02:58:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We have Boolean variables that are either true or false.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10696" target="_blank">02:58:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have expressions that evaluate to Booleans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10698" target="_blank">02:58:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can express a condition as a bunch of these features together, but you've lost any computation you've done in doing that Boolean expression evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10708" target="_blank">02:58:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a functional logic language, um, your condition wouldn't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10712" target="_blank">02:58:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It would either succeed and produce a value, or it would fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10715" target="_blank">02:58:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If it succeeds, it goes to the then branch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10718" target="_blank">02:58:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Your operation succeeded, now you're operating, you know, running this one batch of code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10721" target="_blank">02:58:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if your expression failed, then you go to the else branch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10725" target="_blank">02:58:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But the exciting thing about that is your expression that succeeds or fails can produce values, uh, and bind variables, um, that are then accessed by the then branch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10735" target="_blank">02:58:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can write a conditional where you can only get to the inside of the condition, um, the then, if a bunch of variables have successfully been bound to variables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10743" target="_blank">02:59:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it lets you test if some conditions hold, and then use the results of those tests, um, and that gives you a much higher level of reliability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10749" target="_blank">02:59:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then a for loop, um, in a traditional language, it's just a bunch of imperative code that's woven together to produce a bunch of values iteratively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10759" target="_blank">02:59:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, uh, it's rather awkward to do complicated things in for loops, and so you often end up with the ever more complicated constructs built to work around that, like iterators and other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10768" target="_blank">02:59:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the idea of functional logic languages is your for loop can just produce multiple values, and if it produces zero values, you go through zero iterations, and it produces a bunch of values, you go through all of those as your iterations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10780" target="_blank">02:59:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Rather than having a bunch of nested loops, you're going to write arbitrary things that look like SQL queries in a condition or in a for loop that bind a bunch of variables, do a bunch of tests, produce a bunch of a series of results, and then some order that you're iterating over, and then you can handle all of them and produce a result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10799" target="_blank">02:59:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So you kind of gain the power of SQL queries, you know, large, complex queries over data structures, in a language that is, um, much simpler in which your code is just performing simple iterative operations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10811" target="_blank">03:00:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it kind of gives you the best of databases and of regular programming in a much more uniform way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10817" target="_blank">03:00:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the power of this is now users can write functions that not only produce a value, you can write functions that might fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10824" target="_blank">03:00:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can write a function that answers a question, the answer can be either yes, and my value is this, or no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10830" target="_blank">03:00:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can combine these together into arbitrary queries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10834" target="_blank">03:00:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you like, the funny thing is that this is not how C++ works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10839" target="_blank">03:00:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we have Epic programmers moving over from C++ and writing their first verse code, they try to write C++ code in verse style, and it actually ends up being kind of convoluted code that's worse than good C++ or good verse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10852" target="_blank">03:00:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When we see, you know, but after a few months, they get up to speed, and they're writing really awesome code that's tighter and more compact than before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10858" target="_blank">03:00:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And with users who've never programmed before, but are learning programming for the first time in the context of Fortnite, it's really fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10866" target="_blank">03:01:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You see, these users are learning this kind of as, it becomes their intuition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10871" target="_blank">03:01:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They just assume programming works this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10873" target="_blank">03:01:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And they write, they're writing way more advanced and interesting for loops and conditions than we're often writing internally because they've kind of rocked the core concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10881" target="_blank">03:01:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, you said a lot of really interesting stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10884" target="_blank">03:01:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, it's very interesting that there's a bunch of people, a lot of people learning programming for the first time with verse, which is a very different way to look at programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10895" target="_blank">03:01:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some deep sense, as you're saying, a very intuitive way to learn programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10901" target="_blank">03:01:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of properties about this being a logical language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10905" target="_blank">03:01:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, one of which, well, we could maybe speak also about confluence, but also correctness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10915" target="_blank">03:01:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, being able to prove the correctness of a code is basically easier to write bug-free code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10925" target="_blank">03:02:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you just speak to that and the importance of that when you're building the metaverse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10931" target="_blank">03:02:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10933" target="_blank">03:02:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the challenge with the metaverse is, first of all, that it's a huge base of code that's evolving over time and written by many authors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10940" target="_blank">03:02:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You might see every second a new module is updated somewhere, and you expect in this live, ever-running simulation that never shuts down, for everything to upgrade live in place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10950" target="_blank">03:02:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, one critical component that is the ability to release an update to something you've already published and be sure that it's backwards compatible with the one that you've already released.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

backwards compatible with your old one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10968" target="_blank">03:02:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that comes down to the type system of the language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10970" target="_blank">03:02:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's been a lot of very interesting research on type systems over the years, most of which hasn't ever made it into the C++ programming language, unfortunately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10980" target="_blank">03:03:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But you see several branches of that whole field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10983" target="_blank">03:03:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the really interesting things that Java and C Sharp did in the early days, and then later abandoned and didn't bother update,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=10990" target="_blank">03:03:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">was defining a very rigorous set of rules for if you publish a module with one set of types today, then what changes can you make to that module for your future updates to it that don't break backwards compatibility?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11003" target="_blank">03:03:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a problem for type checking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11005" target="_blank">03:03:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, say you have a function that promises to return some integer, well, in the future you could say that returns some natural number, because every natural number is an integer, so that's a backwards compatible change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11013" target="_blank">03:03:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can't say it returns a rational number, because some rational numbers are not integers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11017" target="_blank">03:03:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, the system ought to reject that kind of change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11021" target="_blank">03:03:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But the much, much, much, much more interesting thing about type checking was the realization, it was actually made in the 1930s, that if you design a programming language type system in a very particular way, then it becomes not only useful for expressing types of variables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11038" target="_blank">03:03:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the traditional thing every type system does is say, like, "Variable X is of type integer," but if you design a type system in a certain way, then your types can express theorems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11050" target="_blank">03:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, mathematical theorems, you know, the Pythagorean theorem is a cool one, but one theorem you might set in a program is like the theorem that this function takes an array of integers and returns an array of the same integers, but the result is sorted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11066" target="_blank">03:04:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If you express that as a theorem, and you follow this system of type theory, then you can actually require that anybody who writes that sorting function to prove that it has actually sorted its result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11078" target="_blank">03:04:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have types or theorems, and values constructed a certain way can be proofs of those theorems.</span></div><div class="c"><span

theorems are being proven mechanically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11091" target="_blank">03:04:51.160</a></span> | <span

language. It was just writing in ancient Greek to say the steps of the proof to convince the reader that the thing is true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11108" target="_blank">03:05:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Starting in the 1930s, mathematicians moved towards rigorous formal proofs in which there's a series of steps that can be mechanically verified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11117" target="_blank">03:05:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">They're proving things. And when mathematicians say they've done a computer proof of a theorem, what they really mean is they've written the program in a proof language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11130" target="_blank">03:05:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It means they've written a mechanical proof in that language that a computer is checked so that it's impossible to lie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11138" target="_blank">03:05:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">If you say that you've proven a thing and the computer verifies it, then it's definitely true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

idea that's making its way into programming languages gradually over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=11153"

of the reason that security vulnerabilities happen today is because, in a different language, a compiler could have caught or not caught in C, because it just doesn't have this

Epic Games, um, sorry, 18% less on Epic Games Tour, um, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14519" target="_blank">04:01:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that would actually start to reshape consumer behavior significantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14522" target="_blank">04:02:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">People would start coming here for the better deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14524" target="_blank">04:02:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But if, like, Steam, you know, giving developers nasty phone calls and so on when they, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14529" target="_blank">04:02:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">propose to do that, uh, prevents developers from passing on savings to consumer, then what's the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14536" target="_blank">04:02:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">what's the mechanism that drives users away from the incumbent store to the store that offers a better deal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14543" target="_blank">04:02:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if basically, basically developers are fearful of competing on price through stores, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14550" target="_blank">04:02:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what can possibly be done to get a dominant store with, you know, something like 90% of revenue share from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14557" target="_blank">04:02:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, among, you know, multi-publisher stores, uh, you know, in line, uh, so that, uh, a much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14565" target="_blank">04:02:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">much smaller store can compete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14567" target="_blank">04:02:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think some answer is required there, um, a better UI is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14571" target="_blank">04:02:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, Steam is super polished, Epic Games Store, and, you know, time will hopefully be as polished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14576" target="_blank">04:02:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, how, how, how does that overcome the fact that your entire library over the past 15 years is there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14583" target="_blank">04:03:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if developers are, have been afraid to exercise their own economic interest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14588" target="_blank">04:03:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's in a developer's interest to sell on Epic and get 12, you know, you know, 18% more of the revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14594" target="_blank">04:03:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you know, I think there's a real power to incumbents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14599" target="_blank">04:03:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very hard to overcome, uh, for just being there and being as good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14604" target="_blank">04:03:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Ultimately, where I hope it converges to is less exclusivity, and where the competition can be the kind I love the most, which is on the UI, on the experience, and then on the Steam side, on the 12%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14627" target="_blank">04:03:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can go from 30% and start to support the developer by lowering it from 30% closer to 12%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14635" target="_blank">04:03:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, I'm a big supporter, and I don't like the criticism of Epic Games Store, but I also have to say that I don't love the exclusivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14645" target="_blank">04:04:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I understand the reality of the world is that you have to have some mechanism to get people to switch, or not to switch, but to at least get some of their games to try out, to experience, to allocate some of their library to the underdog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14665" target="_blank">04:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I totally understand, and hope the UI keeps improving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14669" target="_blank">04:04:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14670" target="_blank">04:04:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">One more bit on that exclusivity point is that when we told Google that we were going to launch Fortnite outside of Google Play and go into competition with them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14681" target="_blank">04:04:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they viewed exclusivity as such a powerful competitive force that they went around to the top 30 publishers and paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to them in order to agree not to do exclusive deals with competitors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14698" target="_blank">04:04:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was called Project HUG, H-U-G, hold developers close.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14704" target="_blank">04:05:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14705" target="_blank">04:05:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was one of the major pieces of evidence on which the jury found their practices to be illegal and anti-competitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14715" target="_blank">04:05:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And the one more data point on that, you know, we talk about 30%, and there's always a lot of people defending Steam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14721" target="_blank">04:05:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, of course, they have more costs because they have more features than Epic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14723" target="_blank">04:05:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We have data on that that's very detailed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14727" target="_blank">04:05:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">The all-in cost of operating the Google Play Store, stocking it, maintaining it, the software, the entire ecosystem, is around 6% of revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14737" target="_blank">04:05:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, in a competitive market, would a company whose cost is 6% be able to charge 30%?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14746" target="_blank">04:05:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, absolutely not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14749" target="_blank">04:05:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And Apple's costs are similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14750" target="_blank">04:05:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple runs an even more efficient and lean operation than Google, so their costs are also likely in the range of 6%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14756" target="_blank">04:05:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">All-in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14757" target="_blank">04:05:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">They market up from 6% to 30%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14760" target="_blank">04:06:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, only a monopoly can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14762" target="_blank">04:06:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at competitive businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14765" target="_blank">04:06:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They have a margin of a few percentage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14766" target="_blank">04:06:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The numbers there are strikingly supportive of just outright anti-competitive market distortions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14776" target="_blank">04:06:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14776" target="_blank">04:06:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think is the future of the gaming industry?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14778" target="_blank">04:06:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we've said, to me, a bunch of exciting stuff about indie developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14783" target="_blank">04:06:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, do what are called AAA video game companies, so these big gaming companies, do they have a future?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14792" target="_blank">04:06:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">What is their role?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14793" target="_blank">04:06:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you see, like, in the next 5, 10, 20 years, the evolution of these big companies and indie developers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14801" target="_blank">04:06:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there's one constant in gaming that I think the industry manages to lose sight of from time to time, astonishingly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14808" target="_blank">04:06:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14809" target="_blank">04:06:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And people play games for fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14811" target="_blank">04:06:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Our whole job is to deliver fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14813" target="_blank">04:06:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you look at a lot of the games that failed recently, they just didn't deliver fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14819" target="_blank">04:06:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they didn't deliver fun in a manner that was nearly competitive with the other sources of fun that exist in people's lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14827" target="_blank">04:07:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, at a basic level, we don't need a terribly complicated theory to explain a lot of the malaise in the game industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14834" target="_blank">04:07:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's been a degradation of the capabilities of a lot of publishers, partly because of competition for talent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14841" target="_blank">04:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, companies like really vibrant game businesses like Epic or Riot or others are hiring the best developers and accumulating them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14849" target="_blank">04:07:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And big tech companies are hiring the best game developers because there's super talent there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14852" target="_blank">04:07:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, in some cases, companies aren't competing robustly or getting worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14857" target="_blank">04:07:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They're making games that are less fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14858" target="_blank">04:07:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I think everything else that's happened is kind of a sideshow to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14863" target="_blank">04:07:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's always political drama and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14866" target="_blank">04:07:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that just the core is a failure to deliver fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14869" target="_blank">04:07:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the nature of fun is changing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14871" target="_blank">04:07:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It turns out that playing a game together with your friends in a really socially and engaging way with voice chat is just way more fun than playing a solitary game for the most part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14881" target="_blank">04:08:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are exceptions to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14883" target="_blank">04:08:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think we're seeing much, much more playtime shifting towards games you're playing together with your friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14889" target="_blank">04:08:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And not just random internet strangers who happen to play that game, too, but people actually know in the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14894" target="_blank">04:08:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's certainly been the case with me and with almost everybody I know who's playing Fortnite or similar games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14901" target="_blank">04:08:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And that has really significant effects in reshaping the whole game business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14905" target="_blank">04:08:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, like, a single-player game, if you have 20 people with 20 different opinions of which game to play, each one might buy a different single-player game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14913" target="_blank">04:08:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But in a multiplayer game, if there are 20 games out and each one might have their own completely individual preference and each one are independently choosing which game to play, each one might buy a different game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14925" target="_blank">04:08:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're all realizing that they want to play together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14928" target="_blank">04:08:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what players are doing increasingly is playing a game they like and accept together with their friends, even if it's not the game that every one of them might be preferring to play themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14941" target="_blank">04:09:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, that's certainly the case in, you know, different Fortnite groups I play with from time to time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14948" target="_blank">04:09:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, you know, one player might have been preferring to play COD, one might have been preferring League of Legends, somebody else, something completely random.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14954" target="_blank">04:09:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's just so fun to play together that we're doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14957" target="_blank">04:09:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that means that there's really strong Metcalfe's Law effect in which games which are able to attract a large percentage of your friends are more able to attract you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14967" target="_blank">04:09:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only attract, but also retain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14970" target="_blank">04:09:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, I think Matthew Ball's analysis of this over the years has really documented the trend towards, you know, you can call it the metaverse or you can call it large-scale multiplayer social gaming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14981" target="_blank">04:09:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">He's really documented this trend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14983" target="_blank">04:09:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, over the past year or so, it's taken a really, really strong turn towards increasing rate of change, increasing numbers of players coming to Fortnite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14991" target="_blank">04:09:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we hit an all-time high of 110 million monthly active users about a year ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14997" target="_blank">04:09:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=14998" target="_blank">04:09:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And another, like, close to peak this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15001" target="_blank">04:10:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Roblox is bigger than ever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15002" target="_blank">04:10:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, this trend is players consolidating into multiplayer experiences that they play together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15008" target="_blank">04:10:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're seeing another trend overlaid with that, which is, like, when an awesome single-player game comes out or a small and multiplayer game comes out, people often will, like, treat it as a vacation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15016" target="_blank">04:10:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll go off and play that game for a while, then come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15018" target="_blank">04:10:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think Wukong was an awesome example of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15021" target="_blank">04:10:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">A wonderful game from a brilliant team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15023" target="_blank">04:10:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">In China, they made a game that's, like, no Western players had really seen that type of thing done before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15029" target="_blank">04:10:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was awesome and it did well, but most players played it for a while and moved back on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15034" target="_blank">04:10:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can be lucrative, but a business that's building that kind of game is just going to have to build a new one every few years and build a business around that while the other games continue to accrete users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15045" target="_blank">04:10:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, when you have a large number of gamers migrating to a small number of games, the effect of that is increasing revenue for those games, increasing reinvestment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15056" target="_blank">04:10:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, there are things that Epic can do with a team of thousands of people building Fortnite internally and tens of thousands contributing to Fortnite as independent creators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15067" target="_blank">04:11:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there are just things that can happen with that level of investment that can't happen in a smaller game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15073" target="_blank">04:11:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there is somewhat of an increasing win-or-take-all dynamic where the biggest games reinvest more to make their games more fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15079" target="_blank">04:11:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They gain fun at a faster rate than other games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15081" target="_blank">04:11:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the industry is changing around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15084" target="_blank">04:11:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, so I think the lesson for the game industry now is that there are really two big opportunities being pursued.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15091" target="_blank">04:11:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There's big games or games that have the potential to be really big multiplayer experiences that keep players around, you know, indefinitely for very long periods of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15100" target="_blank">04:11:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there are just really good single-player and small-scale games that people are taking a break from their big games for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15106" target="_blank">04:11:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the trend there is going to be towards efficiently developing those games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15110" target="_blank">04:11:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't build one of those games with a $300 million budget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15113" target="_blank">04:11:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can do it with a $40 million budget, you can make a lot of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15117" target="_blank">04:11:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's the main reshaping going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15119" target="_blank">04:11:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that it creates a rather bleak outlook for a lot of the category of, like, single-player games that don't have a huge audience to reach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15129" target="_blank">04:12:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, but this is just one of the really trends of restructuring the business around the technology and changes of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15136" target="_blank">04:12:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, this is going to be a ridiculous question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15138" target="_blank">04:12:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But aside from the games you've created, what are some of the greatest video games ever created to you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15146" target="_blank">04:12:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what video games have been, like, either impactful to you in your life or maybe you've seen created?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15155" target="_blank">04:12:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're like, huh, that's a beautiful art piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15157" target="_blank">04:12:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it could be in a totally different realm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15160" target="_blank">04:12:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, obviously, for me, I return to often to the single-player domain of role-playing games of the Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15169" target="_blank">04:12:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That was like a world that they created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15171" target="_blank">04:12:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">A recent game, Baldur's Gate 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15174" target="_blank">04:12:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a really incredible piece of work and art and doing a lot of innovative stuff, again, in the single-player domain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15183" target="_blank">04:13:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there games like that outside the ones you've created?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15186" target="_blank">04:13:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm most impressed with the games that have created what appears to be a full-living, breathing world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15193" target="_blank">04:13:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, games that give you the sense that you're just a part of it and there's a lot more happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15200" target="_blank">04:13:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's always more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15203" target="_blank">04:13:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it gives you the sense that you can go anywhere and do anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15208" target="_blank">04:13:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though these games really do have finite limitations and there are places you can't go, really creating that sense of wonder is just a magical thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15217" target="_blank">04:13:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, Zelda Breath of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15223" target="_blank">04:13:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an entire ecology simulator in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span

and he was commenting on, like, this is one of the very few games that's hydrologically sound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15234" target="_blank">04:13:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15235" target="_blank">04:13:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The way, like, they actually went to the effort of shaping the rivers to follow, like, erosion dynamics and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15241" target="_blank">04:14:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just the attention to detail and there's something there that's big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15245" target="_blank">04:14:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's been funny journeying through the industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15248" target="_blank">04:14:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I last designed a game in 1992.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15251" target="_blank">04:14:11.840</a></span> | <span

class="t">Yeah, I have a very open-minded here that, like, the best game genre that will ever exist has not yet been invented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15262" target="_blank">04:14:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we get more technological capabilities and creatives, people use that to, you know, hopefully empowered by higher productivity tools and so on, that we'll see more and more cool things emerge that we'd never dreamed possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15276" target="_blank">04:14:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the idea of a world simulator is actually really interesting there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15280" target="_blank">04:14:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been tried a

extremely slow and expensive to create, but over time maybe we'll get better at that and that will be a thing too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

your actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15299" target="_blank">04:14:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">To do that, that scale of world, but to where you can step into it and be in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15307" target="_blank">04:15:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think Red Dead is a great example, but to do Red Dead Redemption in a way where you can walk around with friends at a large scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15320" target="_blank">04:15:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess what you have given so many years to do is creating the tools that enable the artist to give that attention to detail that Red Dead does on those, on several of the things.</span></div><div class="c"><span

that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc&t=15337" target="_blank">04:15:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

don't know what it is, but the love of the artist comes through somehow and you could feel the care that they put into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
