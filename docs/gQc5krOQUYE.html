So last week, Altos Labs announced that they've landed $3 billion in funding. And this has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3357">00:55:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">been an ongoing funding that's been going on for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3360">00:56:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">quite a while into this business.

Whenever I see these grandiose prognostications of future progress, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3493">00:58:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">see these companies raise exorbitant amounts of money. I have never found a single example where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3499">00:58:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">it's ever worked ever. In fact, every time I see a company raise an exorbitant amount of money in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3505">00:58:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">day, I write them off in my head. Yeah, sure. Yeah. So why should I not in this case? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3510">00:58:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">or it's more actually actually better question, why would somebody listening to this pod go work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3515">00:58:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there?

And there's a similar sort of research track underway. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3530">00:58:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">think the general principle Chamath is they don't know what the product is, they don't know the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3534">00:58:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to market. And they don't know what the product is. And they don't know what the product is. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3535">00:58:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't know, you know, what area they need to explore. But the underlying principle is proven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3540">00:59:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the underlying principle is something that people believe in. This science is proven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3544">00:59:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">this science is real, we don't know the commercial path. And we have to try lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3548">00:59:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of different things and run lots of different research programs in parallel to figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3552">00:59:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And each of those research programs is like $100 million biotech startup. And so I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3556">00:59:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that the principle is, let's put a lot of shots on goal, all at once in parallel and make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3562">00:59:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">because if any of these shots on goal work, this is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3565">00:59:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">worth many, many billions of dollars. So I think that's generally the idea. It's almost like having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&t=3568">00:59:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a $3 billion venture fund.
