Jimmy Donaldson, Mr. Beast.  What's up, brother? How's it going? What's up, everybody?  Let your winners ride. Rain Man, David Sack-- I'm going home. And it said-- We open sourced it to the fans, and they've just gone crazy with it. Love you, Wesley. Ice Queen of Quinoa. I'm going all in. So-- Look at the phone. Wow. Wow. Guys, no selfies. No selfies. I mean, everybody's sending it to their kids as we speak. Yeah. Do your fans have like a name, like Beasties or something? No. Beasties? Besties? Besties? Besties? That's Taylor Swift. Beasties is pretty good. So I think everybody, all of you guys know Jimmy. But let me just tell you the quick story. I hate when people describe me in front of me, but go for it. Jimmy started YouTubing when he was 13 years old. And this is an incredible example. I mean, Jimmy's basically an athlete. So if you take a guy who basically spends 10,000 hours at something, and there's a Steph Curry outcome, there's a LeBron James outcome, and there's a Jimmy Donaldson outcome. So what does this one look like? He starts posting videos online. He starts iterating, iterating, iterating at 16. I think he had like-- I don't know, 2016 or so, he had like 30,000 followers, some nominal number. Kept tweaking, putting in the thousands and thousands of hours, stumbled into college for two weeks, stumbled out. And then fast forward now a decade since he started this, he's basically the most followed human on Earth after Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Although in terms of content creation, he's basically the top two or three most followed people on YouTube, Twitter, TikTok-- sorry, not Twitter. X. X. Billions of views, event-based viewing. So when he launches videos noon Eastern time on Saturdays every two weeks, if you're not watching them, probably people you know, definitely your kids, their friends, it's just a spectacle. And so that's how you've become you. So let's start at the beginning. How did your mom react? Because Sue seems like-- and she works for Jimmy. She's like a head of compliance. She just makes sure no one steals money. It's a nice fun role. So what happened when you showed up and you're like, hey, mom, I've been streaming secretly and I have these followers? Yeah. Well, you know what's interesting, actually, is you should encourage your kids to have hobbies and want to do these things. My mom thought it was crazy that I was talking to people on the internet. So I ended up just lying, like, oh, it was a joke. I just have a friend I'm talking to every night online or on Skype or whatever. And then once I hit 10,000 subscribers, I told her, yeah, I was a lie. I don't have any friends. I'm just making videos. And she just didn't understand it. She was just like, what does this mean? Yeah. Where did the idea for all these spectacles originate from? The first few that really broke through, how did you guys come up with them or how did you come up with them? Yeah. Well, the thing is, for people, if you want to get hypothetically 100 million views on a video, the easiest way is to do something cool no one's done before. And one of the first ones was I saw no one had ever counted 100,000 in a row. So I was like, I'll just count 100,000. I watched that video for about five minutes. Yeah. It's pretty great. It's more than normal. It's 40 hours long, but the retention's two minutes. Yeah. And you look like-- how old were you at that? You computed on that video by the way. 15 years old or something? I was like 18, yeah. It's hilarious. Yeah. So I just started because I didn't have money. So I just started with-- How many views does that have? I think that one's like 30 million. Yeah. Just me counting. But it's funny because it's like, look at this idiot. He counted to 100,000. How much money has it made? That one? I don't know. Ballpark. What do you think? I mean, most videos probably have like $5 RPM, so $150,000. OK. Yeah. Great. OK, so you launched this thing and then it starts to go. And then how do you scale the ideas? Because it does become a bit of a hamster wheel. Like, how do I one-up myself? Do you always feel this pressure to have to one-up yourself from the last video, literally? Yeah. Well, essentially, obviously, I've just been doing this for 14 years. And also, you said 10,000 hours. I think people should change that saying to 10,000 days. And I'm almost at my halfway point to 10,000 days. I think that's how people should start looking at things. Because to be honest, 10,000 hours is pretty easy. What is that? 10 hours a day for three years? Just a random thing. But yeah, just-- I don't know. We would get 100,000 views on a video, take the money, do another video, get 150,000. And I've just reinvested the money for 14 years. And even to this day, whatever I make, I just spend it the next month on content. And the videos have just progressively gotten bigger and bigger. And it's gone from me counting to 100,000 to seeing what happens if you put a Lamborghini on the world's largest shredder. Just random things. Well, you also seem to have some pretty good judgment, where maybe some of your contemporaries don't. We've seen that need to get the next view lead to people doing increasingly dangerous stunts, like taking a Model X over some hill. I think Dobrik did that. Some other person was swinging somebody on a crane. Maybe you could talk a little bit about restraint and understanding, like, hey, even though this is going to get a lot of views, and maybe some of your contemporaries-- I won't give the specific names of people-- but they've done some really idiotic things and gotten hurt. So how do you know when a conversation and some of these ideas maybe go over the line? Well, the obvious answer is common sense. Great, OK. Next question. No, no, no. The thing is, obviously, there's a lot of things people do that they know will get views because of outrage, and it's just easy to do. But if you're trying to build a long-term brand, you don't want to just constantly piss people off just to get attention. Eventually, it stops working. So the real answer is you just got to not go, what is the easiest way to get views? What do people actually want to watch that isn't just going to get views because they're just going to be watching it, essentially. Got it. You have a-- if you-- in Greenville, North Carolina, you basically have your own college campus. It's like buildings, lots, studios, all these young people dynamically running around, doing all this stuff. When I saw it, I was like, this is a tech startup. It felt like Facebook circa 2006, except it's in Greenville. Why did you think you could pull this off there? Yeah, well, the thing is, as you scale up, you're not really-- especially when you're in your young 20s, you're just doing whatever you got to do to keep up with growing and making the videos. So you just kind of blink, and 10 goes to 20 employees, to 50, to 100. How do you get people to go there? What is it that you're giving them where they would leave New York or LA and whatever their job is to try to do this with you? Yeah, that's the hard part. I'm still trying to figure it out. Most people-- it's a lot of convincing, to be honest. I would highly recommend you don't build a company in the middle of nowhere, woods in North Carolina City like ours. Most people don't want to live there. So usually, it's just people who-- their job is kind of their life, and they're very passionate about what they do. So it's like, we provide you a cool job, where one day you're going to bury me alive, the next you're going to figure out how to send me to space or whatever. But the real answer is you just got to find people where work is their life, and so they don't care. But anyone who does, they hate it. Well, that's actually a feature in some ways, right? Yeah. Which is how Silicon Valley used to work, by the way. This is what I was going to say. How do you recruit for that? And what do you do when you find out that there are people that want work-life balance and don't want to do the level-- aren't willing to commit the way you're willing to commit? I mean, like I said, that's the part I'm still trying to figure out, to be 100% honest. I think at some point, I just got to move out of the middle of nowhere in North Carolina. Don't recommend it, building a big company in a small city. How many employees do you have now? There are around 250. So you consider maybe moving it to Los Angeles or something to be closer to Hollywood? No, but just somewhere where it's like a decent-sized city would probably be more optimal. One that has an airport would be nice. Sure. One of the things you say a lot is I'm still trying to figure it out. I think that's the key to your success. Having spoken to you a bunch, I get the sense that you're on this kind of insatiable journey. I mean, you speak in a very grandiose way about what you're trying to do. There's no frigging limit. You see it in your videos, but you also see it in how you've iterated. I tell people there's no one else on Earth, no entrepreneur in history, where you can go track them longitudinally from the first thing they did all the way through to today. If you want to understand this entrepreneur, it's all in the open. Go check it out. And now you'll see the grind, and you'll see what it took to get here. And it doesn't stop. Every week, you've got some new record-breaking 24-hour video coming out, and it's fucking nuts. What's the mission? Where's it all going? And help just frame for the audience, for everyone, how do you think about where you're going? The beauty is there's-- well, YouTube, that's my main platform. Obviously, if you buy an Android phone, YouTube's pre-installed, and Alphabet owns it. So when you search things on Google, it takes you to YouTube a lot of times. So YouTube is just massive. I mean, billions of people use it on a monthly basis. And so being big on YouTube, we get 100 million views on a video in the first seven days, which up before the last couple of years, that's never been possible in history. So it's definitely a very interesting time where you can get just unfiltered access to basically unlimited people. And then we just-- weirdly enough, it's not why I got into it, but it ended up just working out that way, that I spent 14 years of my life just studying how to make the most optimal videos, what type of content people want, and we just kind of mastered the art of going viral. And YouTube just so happens to be such a big platform. And so it's pretty nice, because now, like they've been saying, we're getting around a billion views a month. And yeah, we can just-- Where do you want to take it? Well, recently, we started getting into selling-- Long term, yeah. Yeah. Well, we started getting into selling some CPG products. So we started with chocolate. And it's nice, because the same people who I would take pictures with in Walmart, when they see our product there, they're like, oh, it's the guy from YouTube, and they'll buy it. And so just kind of-- right now, just anything in retail is great, because you just put things on a shelf, and people buy it. And it's much easier than doing something complicated. I tell people, it's almost as if you think your job is to make people happy. Is that a good way to frame-- Yeah, of course. --your job? Yeah. The other thing that I find just extraordinary about your business is you're essentially built Walmart without any of the cost structure. Any brand you decide to build will immediately have the first 10 million customers. Yeah, well, the beauty is we don't have-- essentially, don't have to do marketing. Zero marketing costs, but also zero distribution costs. That can go one of two ways, with the Mr. Beast Burger-- Yeah. --you learned a lot of lessons there. Maybe went too fast. You didn't expect it to be so popular, and you lost control of that. And then with the Feastables stuff, you nailed it. So maybe you could tell us the lessons from each of those projects. Well, yeah, the beauty of Feastables is-- I mean, kind of like I said, you just put it on a shelf, and people go there and buy it. I don't know. I mean, you want to ask me something more specific? I don't know. No, but be honest. Mr. Beast Burger-- Be honest about-- hold on. Be honest about the insane amount of product development work you personally do, and how deeply you care about making it work. I think that's what's missing for a lot of people. Well, no, and then my point was, Mr. Beast Burger, you kind of loaned your name to it, and it didn't have the same quality control. Yeah. That one I can't talk about, but-- Oh, OK. No problem. I was wondering. No problem. Yeah, well-- OK, let's just admit those last few questions were shitty. Let's reset. No, I think it's a great question. You just can't talk about it. Let's bring it back to the-- We've got a lawsuit going on. All right, let's go back to the two smarter people here. OK.  David, you have a question? I want to ask about-- I better get onto a new topic here real quick.  The thing I've been really blown away by is just how elaborate your productions are. I mean, some of these videos are incredibly elaborate in the production values and in the storytelling. The one that comes to mind for me is the Squid Game series, which, I mean, that looked monumental logistically to pull off, and in terms of set design and every other way. I mean, I guess tell us more about what goes into that. And what I'm kind of hearing from you with the 250 people you have working, you've built this whole town, it sounds like the old studio system, like back in Hollywood, like Warner Brothers back in the 1930s, where they had their own lots, their own actors, their own everything. And it was very different back then. Like we heard Gwyneth saying that most of her time in the process is like waiting around. It doesn't sound like that's what's going on with you. So you're back to kind of the original studio system. Yeah, exactly. I mean, like I said, the beauty is we don't have a studio that tells us what we can or can't do, or the distribution or anything. It's just we own it all. So we just make whatever videos we think will be viral. And obviously, we have the direct connection. And so the big thing is, like, obviously, YouTube, at the moment, you don't make that much from ad revenue. So to do these big multimillion dollar videos, it's just not really possible, which is why doing things like Feastables and other products that generate revenue on the back end is why we're able to do that and other people aren't. Because it's like, you know, even if you get 100 million views on a video, the RPM's $5. It's only $500,000. You know what I mean? So it's not that crazy, which is why people aren't able to do these big budget spectacles like we are, because most people don't even get anywhere near that kind of viewership. And so it's like the beauty is creating the model where we turn around and we use that to sell products, sell a couple hundred million of that a year, and then we use that to put it back into the content. Is there pressure to tone down, like, the consumerism or the giving away money? Like, do some-- I'm sure there's a faction of people that either find that offensive or they think it's exploitative. How do you deal with that? No? No, not really, to be honest. Most people think it's cool, because it's kind of fun to watch someone receive $10,000 or a Lamborghini or a house. Like, the last thing we did was I ordered pizza and I tipped the guy a house. And like--  I thought that was cool. Not bad. I actually ordered two pizzas, one from Domino's and one from Pizza Hut. And the guy who got there first got the house. I mean, there was--  So the Domino's guy got it. So I ordered Domino's. I think, like, no, but didn't you do something-- it was curing blindness? Yes. Yeah, it would help the 1,000 blind people see. There was, like, 10 Karens who got upset, and people were like-- But there were people, right? Like, 10 Karens got upset, and it was like, really? At the end of the day, as long as I think what I'm doing is good and helping people, like-- obviously, at the scale of our views, that video got 200 million views. Of course, some subsection is going to be mad. It's just kind of, at that number, it's just inevitable that people will be unhappy. There's a piece of your business that actually many people probably don't know about outside the commercial part, which is Beats Philanthropy. Yeah. Do you want to tell people about the size of the food bank you've built and how that works? Sure. So I just-- I feel we're talking about it myself, but we essentially just started a charity and then made a YouTube channel where, you know, whatever we do with the money from the charity, we film it. So then it generates revenue on the back end. And obviously, those videos go on to raise a lot of money for donations. And so it's just kind of a cycle where we upload a video a week, and we were able to build a couple of food banks and feed a couple hundred thousand people, that kind of stuff.  Do you want to talk about the business model in the future? So you have basically this YouTube business. Yeah. And that goal is essentially just maximize growth. Yeah, just make content people want and get as many views as possible. And as J. Cal said, build distribution and direct it at these old legacy companies. Are there things-- but you said you wanted to do things that were just like-- it seemed less offline, right? So I'm sure you looked at online things. Yeah. I mean, right now, it's just like-- the reason we started with chocolate is, obviously, in the last 50 years, there hasn't been any major chocolate company that has spawned up. Like Hershey's, Limp, Mars, Farrar, they're all like 100 years old. And so it's kind of just a sleepy space where they don't really innovate, and it's kind of boring, and no one really cares. And so obviously, eventually, we'll do online because it's much easier to get people to download an app to buy a physical product. But it's just kind of perfect because the shelf space never changed, and people want something new. And so it was easy to take over. How big is that business for you, can you say? This is our second year. We'll do a couple hundred million. Wow. OK, wait. So we just guessed about the math here. You said a billion views a month at $5 CPM. So it's $5 million a month for the video, so $60 million a year. And the chocolate bars will do $200? I mean, we're not really public about it, but it'll do a lot of revenue. We'll figure it out. They'll do something, more than a penny. What do you think about the success of Prime? How do you look at that? Yeah, they're killing it. Yeah, that's a great case study. It's just-- Because I heard you can build-- You never-- I heard you can build a million revenue, right? Well, I don't know about that, or at least I can't say publicly. But I can say you never would have thought tens of millions of kids, or at least millions of kids, would be so enthusiastic about a sports stream. It's crazy the kind of demand they've created, like kids literally collect Prime bottles, and then TikToks go viral showing off their collection of drink bottles that are like $3. Raise your hand if you've got kids that do that. Yeah, it's wild. I mean, so Prime was great because obviously it's a beverage, and the more shelf space you get, just naturally more sales. But it was more a lifestyle brand they created where just kids felt cool drinking it, and to the point where they would buy a 12 pack for like $15, and then sell them for like $6 a bottle at their school, which is like something that happens in almost every school in America. It's crazy, still to this day after like a year and a half. One of the things that I think if you taste Prime that it has is a ton of sucralose, right? So it tastes super like bam, big mouth feel. Where's your thinking on like the line between nutrition versus just tastes good for the products you have and the products you want to build, and where do you want to take that? Oh, great. I think that's very important. That's why our chocolate, we only use four ingredients, whereas Hershey's uses nine. Because obviously, since we have this much influence, we don't want to just make people-- whatever we sell needs to be better than what's currently on the shelf, or then it's just a net negative. You know what I mean? Better for you, higher quality ingredients, et cetera. So yeah, I mean, in a nutshell, that's kind of how I view it. And so what are these other areas and that just make maybe obvious sense if you could snap your fingers and just-- Yeah, well, I think the simplest thing-- the more I've studied chocolate and see it, like we started with-- funny enough, we started selling dark chocolate, which 65% of kids in America don't even like. So that was kind of dumb, but I didn't know any better. So I mean, the simplest thing is do milk chocolate, which is what we're getting into, and then just going down and maximizing chocolate, like doing Reese's Cups and that kind of stuff. So past chocolate, I haven't really thought about it, because that's basically all I'm thinking about for next year. Do you think the candy business can be a billion dollar revenue business? Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, look at Hershey's. What are they doing? $12 billion a year, Mars, tens of billions. I mean, in America alone, I think people spend $25 billion a year on chocolate. And there's no one in those companies building a Mr. Beast competitor. I mean-- From a brand perspective. There's no one in those companies that build the companies. They're like 100 years old. Yeah. They're all dead. But yeah. How do you-- you must have a ton of inbound to do things outside of the Mr. Beast realm, Hollywood, et cetera. How do you sort through all the inbound opportunities and then organize? Because you could, I would suspect, be drowning in opportunity at this point with this level of notoriety. Yeah. That's why we are where we are is because we just laser focus on one thing for essentially my entire life. And so it's pretty easy. I just say no. Everything. And then, yeah, because it's like, obviously, to make the videos of the caliber we need, it's just like that's been my obsession for the last 14 years, almost every waking hour of the day, just obsessing over every little thing. Even simple things like when you click on a video, the brightness in the video matters. Like if it's a little too dark, people are more apt to click off and not watch it because not everyone has their phone screen brightness turned up. You did something with your mouth being open or closed in the thumbnail and it changed click-throughs. That was a new A/B test. Well, the problem is whatever I do, a bunch of other people do. And I started opening my mouth in my thumbnails. And it's kind of annoying. And then a bunch of other creators did it. And I was like, OK, we're not doing this anymore. So I switched them back. So everyone else will switch them back. What's the budget on each video now? So every two weeks, how much money goes into that video? I think right now it's around $2.5 million per video. Oh, OK. Yeah. That's like making an independent film every two weeks. Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's that crazy, though, because they're getting like 100 million views in seven days. So if any other medium outside of social media that got that kind of viewership, their budget would be like 50x. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Yeah. Do you think that you're building a library? Do you expect that the video that you created, the Olympic games thing you did a few weeks ago, in five years, that that'll still be-- that'll have some value 15 years from now? Well, 15, I don't know. But five, yes. Usually, whenever we upload a piece of content, we'll get a couple million views a month for-- as of right now, forever. But obviously, eventually, it'll probably die off. But they're usually pretty evergreen. Because right now, because we have the model where we're making money outside of YouTube so I can spend more, it's like you have this video that's $2.5 million budget, or another video that's $2,500 budget. And so right now, usually people end up just clicking on the cooler stuff. And then how do you think about just the axis of going outside the United States? So different languages, different countries, how do you deal with that? That's the best part. So as you know, we hired voice actors to dub our videos in every language. And I assume a lot of you guys here are content creators. And the crazy part is only 10% of the world speaks English. So if your content's only in English, it's pretty hard to obviously reach most of the world, even subtitles. Most people don't prefer it. So if you dub your videos, hire voice actors or whatever, your viewership will skyrocket. And so right now, over half the people that watch my videos don't even speak English, which is pretty crazy. Tell me about the relationship with YouTube and how that's evolved over the years. Because I don't know they anticipated that the footprint of the top creators on YouTube would get so large. Are they deeply involved in communicating with you? Or are they just like, hey, we're a platform. Post a video if you like it. It's that. That's extraordinary to me. I mean, I kind of like it because then no one can say there's favoritism or they're helping us in any way. But agreed, even when I was coming up, people were getting 10 million views a video. And that was mind-blowing. And their lifecycle would be like a year, and they'd fall off. So it's kind of crazy. I don't really know how we ended up getting this big. Was there ever a thought to tell them, I need to make a higher minimum per RPM, and I'd like to cut a deal with you to hit these numbers and be treated differently? They'd be like, well, then everyone's going to want that. Because if they do it with me, then they would open the floodgates. They would just tell me, spend less money. Got it. Interesting. Because no one's forcing me to spend this much money. It's kind of the problem. Technically, most people don't spend hardly any money. But there was a moment in time where Microsoft started stealing away some YouTubers and folks for their Twitch competitor. Did you get those kind of offers? And then how did you evaluate them? Well, the problem is, like I said at the start, YouTube's where all the viewers are. So it's like, sure, you can get a little bit of money. But ultimately, the real game is if you can get a billion views a month for 10 years, whatever, the amount of brands we could build is insane. It is the great success of YouTube that they've hit this level of scale. Exactly. And the features and stuff on that, YouTube is the only platform right now where you can upload a video in different languages. So if someone clicks my video in Mexico, I'll speak Spanish. Whereas if you click it in America, I'll speak English. That feature is in beta right now. Yeah, well, they've rolled it out to other people. On TikTok, Facebook, no other platform can you do that. So YouTube's the only place right now where you can actually have a global audience. Do you provide the voiceover person, or is that done automatically? Because they're working on an automatic version, I was told. For the first or the next two years, it'll probably sound terrible. But of course, at some time in the near future, AI dubbing will-- We get hit up about that all the time for the all-important things. Right now, I've trained a ton of different voice models. They all sound terrible. But it is obviously getting better very quickly. Have you published any to see what the viewership looks like? Yeah, AIME versus real voice actors? We have. And it's usually-- so if it's a one-minute video, and the retention with normal voice actors is 45 seconds, it'll be like 42. But it'll also be a lot of comments like, why does he sound slightly off? So the retention isn't as bad as you would think, but it's still like-- You can tell the quality score's lower. Yeah, exactly. The thing is, when you're using dubs, you're already at a disadvantage. Because they can choose to watch someone in their native language or watch you with a guy speaking over your lips. And so if it's not as good as-- you're already down here a little bit worse. And then if you use AI dubbing, it's even worse. I think video games are six times the revenue for movies today. Have you thought about video games? I've got to assume folks have approached you. And how do you think about the video game industry? Because you have a lot of audience overlap, I've got to imagine. Yeah. To be honest, I tried to build one. And then six months in, I was like, oh, these things take years. And then I was like, I'd rather sell chocolate. So yeah, that was kind of the extent of it. I mean, obviously, it's a no-brainer. Because it's much easier just to tell people to download it. Just click the link in the description and download it. But I've just found that-- I don't know. I just keep going back to it. Making confectionery products is just so much more fun. And 100 million people are walking to Walmart every month. And if you don't have a product there, there's nothing for them to buy. And so I just want to maximize that, getting something in every retailer in America first. One of the things that you've done is you've mentored younger content creators coming up. Who are people that you look at that are creating things that you think are interesting, whether it's formats or-- I'm curious. How many of you guys make content out there? Like, anything? OK. I mean, we do. A little bit. I guess so. Actually, do you have-- I guess we're podcasters. --tips for us? I mean, our viewership on YouTube is embarrassingly small compared to-- One of the things he did first was he ripped apart our thumbnails. Oh, yeah? He said our thumbnails were total shit. I mean, that's-- Remember? And we gave that to Nick. Yeah. Was I joking? Or was I being serious? No, you were telling us. I think you guys, like-- I mean, clearly, it's working. I think that no one cares about your guys' thumbnails. I think the big thing is the value you guys provide and that it's a-- Should we not close our mouths now in thumbnails? Oh, you should. Are the mouths open? Yeah, the mouths are open. Oh, yeah. I would close them. I mean, there's something different about-- James, another-- --each week of-- Especially for this age group, definitely close them. Well, no. I mean, there's--  No one wants to see a shock-- There's something distinctly different about what you do. Every week, it's something new. It's something original. We're trying to have a conversation, McLaughlin group-- Of course. --kind of format. So I think some of those tips don't work. But our audience on YouTube, I think, now will exceed what we're doing in podcasting, ultimately. Because it does seem that people like to watch us and put it on in the background. So we're seeing that. I think we have 380,000. You guys are doing great. To be honest, I remember when you first started it. And I was like, oh, this is an interesting combo. But it works.  And whenever something weird in the world happens, I'm like, oh, I'm going to go see what they think of it. It's cool. Where do you see this-- We met Jimmy at poker, by the way. Do you think we could-- No, where do you think this is going to be in 20 years? What, your podcast? You.  No, I mean, we have an idea where this is going. I don't know where this would be in 20 days, I'll tell you. Actually, to be honest, the only thing in front of us right now are The Daily from The New York Times, A Priest Reading the Bible, and Serial Killer Podcast. Serial Killer Podcast. I mean, it's really not much ahead of us. All our podcasts are in news. All podcasting, those are the three ahead of us. Yeah. And just to build on J-Kal's question, do you feel pressure to elongate the content? Or you feel like you've optimized now the amount of time where you maximize viewership? Well, yeah. I mean, that's actually something we've been focused on a lot recently. I think the problem is people are like, we waited two weeks, and it was just 15 minutes of content. And they actually get annoyed when it's too short. So we're working on elongating it, but not because of algorithms or anything. It's just like people just actually don't like waiting two weeks for just 15 minutes of content. They want more or more frequent videos. And the problem is the spectacles are so big, it's much easier just to make it longer than do a whole new one to upload more. So yeah, they're naturally getting longer and longer right now. I wonder if you did a behind the scenes on the off week and just had another group. Because I was watching the one you did where you were all on a raft. Yeah. And you decided to torture your team. We spent seven days on a raft in the ocean. I mean, it was torture. I mean, it was painful to watch. But a behind the scenes of that done by another group of video editors on the off week, I bet you would do as many views. Yeah. The thing is, though, the mystery is part of what's cool. How does this random YouTuber give a million dollars away to someone on the street or things like that? So part of it is them not knowing how it's even possible is why it's so interesting. And they click on it, if that makes sense. Can you talk a little bit about the point of view where folks say content creators on YouTube have an audience. And that audience ages out. And then they lose that audience. And how you've continued to be able to grow your audience. Yeah. Well, everything is-- Even though some of the folks you started with have gotten older. Yeah. The problem is there's no one size fits all advice. And so obviously, if we're talking to someone who unboxes toys, their audience is going to grow. And there's nothing they can do about it. But for us, ideally, one day you guys aren't going to be like, oh, my kid loves you. You'll be like, I also like your content. But we try to make content that no matter what age you are, you'll enjoy it. So usually they don't-- Who here personally watches Beast? Yeah. Oh. More than I would have thought. Oh, yeah. Us too. Appreciate it. All right, everybody. Jimmy Donaldson. And the timer says 25 seconds. Oh, we went over. We went over. We gave you an extra. Over 25 seconds. Well, you can stay up here if you want. We're going to take questions from the audience. I'll take a question from the audience. I flew out here for this. Let's do some more. OK. I'm going to moderate the question. Raise your hand. How do you stay consistent with executing so frequently? I think that's the hardest thing for entrepreneurs. I'll repeat. I'm going to repeat. I can. I'll repeat it. So he asked, how do you stay so consistent with what? With your execution.  With your incredible execution. It's so hard. You have to spot on all the time. Yeah. He said, how do you be so consistent with execution, spot on all the time? So the thing is, you just have to obviously just train great people. Because if you're doing everything yourself, eventually you're going to burn out, get different interests, blah, blah, blah. And so I actually-- my top people, I bought a house, and we all lived together for years. I just kind of trained them to think like me and see the world like me. And so my top probably 12 people, 95% of the time, if you ask them something and ask me in different rooms, we'll give the exact same answer. And the other 5% of the time will just be very slightly different. Have you thrown away a video because you were unsatisfied with it? Oh, of course. All the time. That happens all the time. Yeah. So out of 10 videos, how many would be-- Well, the thing is, if you want to build viewership over time, if you want to go from 10 million to 20 million views a video to 30 million views a video, you just have to get it where every time they show up, they're happy. They feel like they got value out of it. It's like it was worth their time and investment. So yeah, if something's not good and they click on it, then they're less likely to click on future videos. To grow viewership like that, it has to be-- Want to take a second one? Yeah, take one. Right here. When I hear you talk, you're amazing. You're very uptight. And you've obviously accomplished a lot. I'm just curious, how do you keep your-- how do you keep your ego? So here's a talk you developed with a guy you can back it up to. And it's pretty great. And it's very casual. Thank you. And it's all building to our business. So how do you-- Here, you repeat the question. I don't know how to repeat that one. Not as easy as it looks, huh? That's how he does it. He would like to know how you're a normal person and you stay so authentic given this incredible-- Keep your humility. Yeah, how do you keep your humility? And stay humble, yeah. Well, I think the beauty of it is I usually spend 99% of my time in my studio. So I don't really-- Like, the 100 million number on the video just looks like pixels on a screen. Like, I don't really experience it that much. So I think that's kind of the best part. How do you walk through an airport these days or walk, you know, through a city? It is pretty crazy, huh? I was really worried about getting you here. I kept asking them, how are we going to get him through LAX? I don't understand how this is going to happen. Well, that's-- The thing is you throw a hood on and wear some glasses. And you're pretty good. And you just don't talk out loud or anything like that. So-- Same thing. All right, everybody, give it up for Jimmy Donaldson. Thank you.  That was fun. That was awesome.  I'm going all in. Let your winter slide. Rain man David Sasson. I'm going all in. And it said-- We open sourced it to the fans. And they've just gone crazy with it. Love you, Wesley. I'm the queen of Kinwan. I'm going all in. Let your winter slide. Rain man David Sasson. Besties are gone.  That's my dog taking a noise in your driveway.  Oh, man. Oh, man. My athetaster will meet me at place. We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless. It's like this sexual tension that we just need to release somehow. Let the beat. Let your beat. Let your beat. Beat. That's going to be good. We need to get merch. Besties are back. I'm going all in. I'm going all in. you</p></div></div></body></html>
