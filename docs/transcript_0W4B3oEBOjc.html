It's in the eye of the beholder. If you're bad in your mind, that's the biggest problem. If you're not allowed, it goes against your, I call this your personal bill of rights. You might not have a right to say, "No, I'm not available for that." You might not have a right to not respond to all the emails.</p><p>And as long as you don't have that right, 'cause you haven't claimed it, you're gonna feel guilty, you're gonna feel stressed. So in my personal bill of rights, I have a right to not respond to all emails. I'll reply to a lot of some of the emails of my clients.</p><p>I'll try to get back to a lot of them, but not everybody, not all the time. So someone out there sometimes might think that is E's guy, he's an asshole 'cause he didn't do X for me. And you know what? That's okay. So really finding that permission to not do the things that you truly don't wanna do.</p></div></div></body></html>
