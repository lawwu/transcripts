So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=13" target="_blank">00:00:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all of this code here is a single API. We're not going to go through all of it in this one video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're going to go through the essentials, and we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">step by step put an API together that is going to look very similar to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what this API is doing is pulling information from these two CSV files,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and either presenting that information to us, that data, allowing us to modify,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">allowing us to add new entries, or allowing us to delete it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we get to use get, post, put, and delete methods. Now, if you are following along with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this tutorial, you'll probably want this data. So, you can get it using this code over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, over here, we have, I'll make sure there's a link to this in the description so you can get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">All we're doing is downloading the code, or those two data files from here, and then storing it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in a local directory. I mean, you can change that directory to whatever you want, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Inside those two files, we have locations here, which is just a list of, I think these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">actually real coffee cafes, but I made this CSV quite a long time ago, so I'm not 100% sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, over here, we just have some made-up user data as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And the end result will be something like this. So, this is a program that I'm working on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is a program called Insomnia. I'll leave a download link to that in the description,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but it just allows us to send API requests very easily. So, I'm going to send an API request to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this address here, which is the API I just showed you, and it's a user's endpoint. We will have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">two endpoints, which are essentially just separations of the API. So, users, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to return all the user's data, and then we also have locations. And we'll send that as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and we return all the locations. Now, we're going to start from scratch, and the first thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll need to do is import everything we need. So, we will need to import Flask. So, from Flask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">import Flask. We'll also need to import Flask RESTful. So, this is another Flask library that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">gives us a few very useful tools for building an API. So, right from Flask RESTful, import resource</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">API and REC pass. Now, specific to what we're doing here, we will also want to import pandas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and import AST. Now, you will probably have to pip install these as well. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the pip for those is pip install Flask and Flask RESTful. Nothing weird there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So, the first thing we need to do is initialize our Flask app and then initialize our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Flask API. So, we do that. So, this is typical Flask here. So, we write Flask name, and then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">API is API equals API app. Okay? Super easy. Now, we already touched on it, but our app is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have two different endpoints. So, we're going to have the user's endpoint, and we're also going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to have the location's endpoint. And we're going to go through building the user's endpoint, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll be able to find the code for both of those in the description. But the way that we separate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">both of these is we use a class object. So, we're going to create our use class first. So, we write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">class users. And then to initialize this as a endpoint for our API, we actually need to pass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the resource object into it. Now, we'll inherit the resource object and expose it to different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like HTTP requests, like get posts and so on. For now, we're not going to add anything in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But to make sure that endpoint is added to our API, we need to write API,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">add resource, and then we need to specify the web address of this or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">almost like a page of a web address that the resource or endpoint will be at. So, we'll say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">users, which is our class, and then the actual endpoint location, which is users. Okay? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this is saying I want you to map the class users here to this place in our API. So, our web address.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if, for example, the API was located at, let's say, API.com,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this resource would be located at API.com/users. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll also create another one, although we're not going to fill it out in this video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that will be called locations. Again, exactly the same thing again. Resource,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll just pass for now. And we'll copy that and do the same for locations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Now, that's sort of the structure or the very high level structure of our API itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we so, what I like to do is whilst we are building or writing the code for our API,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I like to also test it as we go along. I think it makes things a lot easier. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to run our API, we need to write this. If name is equal to main,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we write app.run. Okay? It's that easy. Now, what we can do is just press the execute button up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? Okay. So, we got this error because I, okay. I don't know why I did that. So, this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this needs to be the class, not a string of the class. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now let's run that again. It should work. Okay. So, we get this. This is a development</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">server. Do not use it in production environment. That's fine because we're just testing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can see this is running at this address. Okay. So, if we take this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll copy it and we're going to take it over into Insomnia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And I'll just clear everything that I was doing before and we'll go into here. Okay. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if we send this, we won't return anything yet. So, we'll just get this not found. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">if we go to users, we should at least return this internal server error. So, this means that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, we are not getting anything back because there's an error on server side. So, in our API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is something there. So, before when we just had this. So, remember, we have those two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">endpoints. We're not actually using the base URL. So, there's not actually anything there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We get this not found. Because there just isn't anything there. If we type in locations or users,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we will return this internal server. Now, we're getting this because we haven't written any code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it doesn't know what to do when we send that request. So, let's go back to our code and we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">start writing something. So, first thing I want to do is we'll define a get request. So, write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">find get plus self. And in here, what I want to do is load the user's CSV. So, to get that, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">going to write user's path. So, this is the specific directory that I have stored my user's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">data. Of course, it might be different for you. And what I'm going to do is down here, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to use pandas to read in that data. Whenever I call this get request, I'm going to read it in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is similar to if we, for example, had a database on a server somewhere, when the API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">gets a request, it would read that data quickly and return it to us. So, this is a very simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">version of that. So, I'm going to do data equals pd.read_csv. And we just go user's path. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully, that's the right path. I think it is. We can see. So, if I come up to here, yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we have data. So, I guess that should be fine. User's CSV. Cool. And then what we want to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we can't pass a pandas dataframe object through an API. So, we need to convert this into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">dictionary. So, we write data.to_date. Now, what we want to do is return. We want to return the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">data. So, we're going to write data, which is equal to data, our dictionary. And we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to return the 200 code, which means the API request was successful. Here's your data. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll save that. And I believe it should update automatically. Let me check. So, come over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's send that again to users. Okay. No. So, I think we need to restart the API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, come over here. Here, I'm just going to control C and run it again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you can turn debug mode on. So, I think that will automatically reload everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's do that first. So, down here in app run, we're just going to set debug</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">equals true. Save that. I'm going to press control C down here and execute again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when we make changes, it should reload automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, come over here. Let's send that request again. Now, we see user path is not defined. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">see why that is wrong. So, it's user's path. So, I'll save that and that should reload automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's try again. Okay. Perfect. So, now we get a 200 response there. We get all of our user's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">data. Okay. So, we're just returning that data frame in a dictionary format. Okay. Cool. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that's our get request. Let's move on to let's put requests, I think. So, adding more data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, this time, what we're going to need to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is we're using a post request. So, I put a second ago, I meant posts. And in here, the first thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to do is we need to retrieve information from the user that they want to upload.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the first thing we need to think about here is we are trying to get data from the user. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">they are going to send us like a new entry. So, what did we have before in our users?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We have user ID, name, city, locations. Okay. So, we want the user to be able to add a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">row. So, each one is essentially a row in a data frame. So, we have locations, city, name,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and user ID. Now, we want the user to be able to add locations or location, locations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">name, and city. Now, the I think the user ID, we don't really want the well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the user isn't going to add that. That's going to be generated automatically. So, we ignore that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but we do want the user to be able to pass those three things. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to do that, we're going to use the REC parser. So, request parse that we use up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And to initialize that, we need to write parser equals request. Sorry, why is it up here? REC</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">parse, sorry. REC parse dot request parser here. It initializes our parser. And what this is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is when we add arguments into the request, this is going to read them. And what we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is parse them out into variables. So, we are going to within our within this request,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to allow those three. So, location, name, and city. So, we write parser, add argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This one will be location. And we're just going to do one location at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, do location ID. And then, of course, we use a put request later if they want to add more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">locations. We say required is true. They do need to add one of these. And the type of this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">integer. So, we'll write integer. Okay. We need to add another one. I'm just going to copy this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's copy here. Here. And we have name and city. Name, city. And the type is for both of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">those strings. Which I think might be the default. So, we probably don't even need to include that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">type string there. But it is there. So, we'll leave it. So, now we have the three arguments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that a user can use to post information to our API. And what we need to do to extract whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the user has sent us is we do this. We're going to extract them into this dictionary here, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is called args. And we write parser. Like that. Okay? So, now we have those arguments. And let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">first just make sure this is working. So, I'm going to return what we just tried to send that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's return location. Loc equals args location ID. Name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the city. Okay. So, let's just make sure it's actually working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll say 200. Save it. And that should reload automatically. Let's go over to Insomnia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we are sending a post request here. So, post. We have users. We enter this question mark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this allows us to start adding our parameters. So, location ID is going to be equal to I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to say 5. And so, we added the ampersand symbol there to add another parameter. So, location ID</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and what are the other ones? User. User. Or name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">James. That's me. And for the city, let's put London. Okay. Send that. Cool. And then we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just returning that request back to Azure. You notice here we put lock, not location ID. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you can tell it's not just returning what we sent. It's returning what we have processed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">through our function and returned back to ourselves. Okay. Cool. So, we know we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">passing those arguments correctly. Now, let's use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, what I want to do is read our data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we do data equals data pandas.read CSV, again. And we're reading the user's path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, user's path. And we're doing users here. So, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">do we want location in there at all? I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, maybe. So, no. Let's say the user can specify that. User ID. We're not returning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">anymore. So, I want the user to I want to be able to post this. Because then if we have a duplicate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of a previous user ID, we're not we can say we can check if that already exists in the data or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Which we'll do now. So, if args user ID. In the data that we just loaded. So, in data is it user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ID, I think? I'm sure it must be. Okay. I think it is. I want to return an error message saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this already exists. So, write message. And all we do is write args user ID. Already exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we'll return here is the 409 code, which indicates that there's some sort of conflict.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is a conflict. We already this user ID already exists. So, we're saying there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">conflict. You can't create a new one. It's already there. If it doesn't already exist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that's great. And we go ahead and we create that new user ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we do is write data equals data.append. And then we're just appending the new data that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we've retrieved from our args. So, it's going to be we need user ID. Which is going to be args user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ID. Let me copy this and make it a little bit quicker. For locations, it's just empty for now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We have city and we have name. Okay. And then we need to I think we need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">ignore. Yes. Ignore index. True. True. Sorry. Okay. And then we'll save that data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, two CSV. It is user's path. And I'm going to say index equals false.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're not saving the row numbers. And then I just want to return that data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, we can't return a data frame. We need to convert it into a dictionary. So, write to dict.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a 200 response there. I'm going to save that. Let's test it. See if it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm going to let's see. Modify this to user ID now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Send that. Internal server error. So, let's see. Date frame, no attribute to date. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to add an underscore. Save again. And let's send that again. Okay. So, now we can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we have more items in there. The only thing is I've added five for all of them. Oh, did I?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's in the code, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">What did I do? Yeah. Very smart. Okay. So, change that name. And this is city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And one other thing is that these are all this should also be a string.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing I noticed. And this should also be a string. I'm going to leave it for now. It's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let me send that again. Five already exists. So, at least we know that our conflict</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">code works. So, let's create another one. Number six. I'm going to call this, I don't know, Jim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go again. Okay. So, now we've created number six as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Gosh, we've created a few there. Oops. So, yeah. Now we've created number six here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which is Jim lives in London. His user ID is six. Okay. So, I mean, formatting isn't perfect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's good for now. We've created our first post request. Okay. So, it's pretty annoying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we have those kind of messy entries that we added to our data sets or data frame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we really could do with having in our API is a way to actually delete those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's go ahead and build that. So, we need to first define a delete function method.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And all we really need here is to say, okay, which entry do you want to delete? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't need to have a name or a city or anything. We just want the user ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we'll copy that into here. So, we pass the input from the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we say, okay, add argument, user ID. That's all we need. We don't need anything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what we need to do is pass those as well. So, just like before, pass args. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. So, now we have so, at this point, the user has given us a user ID that they want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to delete. And we need to go ahead and delete that. So, to delete it, first, we need to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, does it exist? So, we say if args user ID is in our data. So, we need to load the data first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let me load it here. Okay. So, if that is in data user ID, then we can go ahead and delete it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And to do that, we're just going to use the typical Pandas data frame logic. So, we just write data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">equals data, data, user ID. And we just want to select the rows that are not equal to the user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ID that we just pulled in. So, the args user ID. Right? So, that's just going to return all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">rows except from the one that we've specified. Okay. So, we deleted that. Now, we just need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">save that to file again. So, to CSV, it is I keep forgetting the variables, user's path,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then indexes false. Okay. So, we've opened the file, deleted the entry, saved it back to CSV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If we have done all of that, we can return to the user a 200 code. So, we'll just return,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">let's return all the data again. We don't need to do this every time. We could just return</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a statement saying, hey, you've deleted everything. So, I'm just going to return so we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">can see what we're actually doing. In reality, probably, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">actually do this. But I suppose it depends. Maybe you would. Who knows? So, return to 100 code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's successful. Now, in the case that the user ID does not exist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here we want to say, okay, we want to check. Well, we've already checked if it exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from there, we're just like, okay, it doesn't exist. What are you doing? So, we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">return. We say, what did we use before when we sent a message? Message. Just message. Okay, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Message. And the message is going to be user ID does not exist. Something along those lines. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">args user ID does not exist. Let me format that a little nicer. And then here, we need to add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the code, which is, I suppose, not found. So, 404. Okay. So, I think that's it, really. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">let's save it. Again, it should reload automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Head over to Insomnia. Let's, again, so let's go to users. We're just going to look at what we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1736" target="_blank">00:28:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, get users. What do we get? We have all these. Now, we want to delete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">user IDs four and five. Okay. These two are messy. We don't want those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we want to specify a user ID. We don't want four. So, we change that to a delete request.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want four. Let's send that, see what happens. Why did that not change?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">A data. Why didn't that change?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">User ID. Is it because this needs to be a string, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. I think. Yeah, probably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me try again. Send. No, still nothing. Okay. So, that took me far too long to actually figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">out what was wrong. But there wasn't anything wrong. There was the string issue. So, we did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">need to convert over to a string to compare them. But also, what I was doing here was reading the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">key value here, so the row number, and thinking four was a user ID. It's not. We have two fives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that we sort of messed up and made those earlier. So, there is no four for us to remove now. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">don't need to worry about it. So, let's test it with five instead, which are the two messy ones</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that we need to remove. So, let's send that. And now, you can see that we've actually removed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">those entries. So, that's pretty good. Now, the one thing I did also notice is if I try and send</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that again, we do get the 404 not found. So, that's pretty cool, right? We've got everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that we would expect with it. Now, I think that's it for the code. The only other thing I wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">show you was this other. So, this is the actual full API script here. So, in here, I also included</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">another method here, or another endpoint locations. And we run that, and we can mess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">around with the cafe locations as well. But that's everything. So, I think there's nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">else we want to cover in this video. So, we'll leave it there. So, thank you very much for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF75aNH3Gjs&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">watching. I hope it's been useful, and I'll see you again in the next one. Bye.</span></div></div></body></html>
