While some elite programmers are skeptical, many developers find significant value in AI tools, suggesting a disconnect between top-tier and mainstream experience. Liu frames the discussion by referencing opinions from figures like Jonathan Blow and Eric S. Raymond, highlighting the varied perspectives in the field.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=181">3:1</a> Paradigm Shift: The most significant mistake developers make is using new agents with old mental models. Liu emphasizes that we are in a "step function transition" in model capabilities, meaning that strategies from even six months ago are already outdated for leveraging the full power of today's agents.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=306">5:6</a> GPT-3 Era (2022): This era was defined by text completion models. The primary application was "copilot" or "autocomplete," where the AI would suggest the next few lines of code based on the preceding context.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=324">5:24</a> ChatGPT Era (2023): The introduction of instruct-tuned models like GPT-3.5 led to the rise of chatbots. In the coding world, this manifested as "ragbots," which combined a chat interface with a retrieval engine to answer questions about a codebase.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=371">6:11</a> Agent Era (Present): The current era is defined by models capable of tool use and autonomous operation. This requires a new application architecture where the agent can directly edit files, run commands, and interact with external services to accomplish a goal.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=447">7:27</a> Autonomous Edits<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=595">9:55</a> Unix Philosophy<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=624">10:24</a> New Applications<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=795">13:15</a> The Task<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=870">14:30</a> Tool Use<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=953">15:53</a> Sub-Agents<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1076">17:56</a> Planning & Execution<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1186">19:46</a> Nuanced Problem Solving<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1401">23:21</a> Detailed Prompts<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1461">24:21</a> Feedback Loops<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1683">28:3</a> Code Understanding<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1716">28:36</a> Code Reviews<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1835">30:35</a> Micromanagement<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1846">30:46</a> Under-prompting<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1912">31:52</a> Parallel Agents<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1998">33:18</a> High-Ceiling Skill<br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><a href="./F_RyElT_gJk.html">Whisper Transcript</a> | <a href="./transcript_F_RyElT_gJk.html">Transcript Only Page</a></div><br><div style="max-width: 800px;"><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=0" target="_blank">00:00:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My name is Bianc.

Okay, so let's check in on the agent discourse. I don't know if you all saw this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but a couple days ago there were some spicy tweets about the efficacy of AI coding agents or inefficacy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on your perspective. So Jonathan Blow, who is a really talented developer, he basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">single-handedly coded up the indie game Braid, if you're familiar with that. So he's kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">god tier status in terms of coding ability.

There's no substance there. And then there were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">some responses, and there was kind of a spectrum of responses too. We had some other big names in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">developer world, like Jessie Frazell. She was one of the early contributors, maintainers of Docker. She's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">also really legit. She said basically something to the effect of like, I think you're right, but you're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">like the top 0.01% of programmers, Jonathan, for the rest of us down here in this room that aren't on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Mount Olympus. It actually helps a lot, but not super helpful if you're really, really good. But then we also had folks like Eric S. Raymond, who is like one of the fathers of open source, who had a very spicy reply. He's basically like, look, I consider myself to be pretty decent at programming, and these things help a lot. And then the kind of my favorite one of this was actually the Top of Hacker News post that was written by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Thomas Tacek, who is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Thomas Tacek, who is a really legit security engineer.

He was basically taking the opposite view of like, you know, there's some really smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">people there who are very AI skeptical, but they're nuts.

And a couple months back, I read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this blog post from this guy, Jeff Huntley. So Jeff was a senior engineer at Canva at the time. And his role</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">at Canva is really interesting. He basically went around interviewing all the developers inside of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Canva using AI tools like cursor and other things and seeing how they're using it. And he basically came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to the conclusion that like most people were holding it wrong, which is really interesting. And he came up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">with the blog post about like all the different anti-patterns that he was seeing. But my summation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of that blog post is like the number one mistake that people are using with coding agents right now is they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to use coding agents the same way they're using AI coding tools six months ago. And therefore, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">probably wrong, which is kind of crazy because normally, if you're, you know, using a tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the best practices don't change in six months.

Feel free to, I like, okay, okay, so maybe I'm, maybe I could just skip this slide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're now living in the era of agents, and the new model capabilities really dictate a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">application architecture. And so one of the things that we asked ourselves at Sourcegraph is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the existing tools in the market that were designed for the era of GPT-4 and CLAWD-3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of the application stuff, features, and UX and UI was really built around the capabilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or in some cases, the limitations of the chat-based LLMs. And so if we were going to design a coding agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">from the ground up to unleash the capabilities of tool using LLMs, agentic LLMs, what would that look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so here are my spicy takes. These are controversial design decisions that I think are better to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in the age of agents. And many of these go against the best practices that kind of emerged in the chatbot era.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so number one is the agent should just make edits to your files. It shouldn't ask you at every turn,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">like, hey, you know, I want to make this change. Should I apply it? If it's asking you and it's wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's already done the wrong thing and it's wasted your time. Humans need to get more out of the inner loop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and more kind of like on top of the loop, like still steering it and guiding it, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">less, you know, micromanaging and managing every change. Second thing is, do we still need a thick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">client to manipulate the LLMs? Like, do we still need a forked VS code? That's like the salty way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">saying this, right? The VS code fork became the culmination of the AI coding application, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">for the chatbot era. But there's this question of like, you know, if the contract of an agent is you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">ask it to do stuff and then it does stuff, do you really still need all that UI built around like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">context management and applying the proposed change in the code base? Or can you just ask it to do stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and expect it to do the right thing? Third, I think we're going to move beyond the choose your own model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">phase. So I think in the chatbot era, it was very easy to swap models in and out. And you'd like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a new model came along, let me swap it out and see how well it attends to the context that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">my retrieval engine fetches. In the agentic world, there's a much deeper coupling because the LLM that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you're using essentially becomes the brains of these agentic chains. And so it's much harder to rip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and replace. And I think a lot of people in this room who have tried mixing and matching, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">different models in the context of agents have found that, you know, swapping out a different model and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">expecting similar results is very different. A lot of the, like, a lot of the LLMs out there aren't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">good at the basics of tool use yet. So it's very difficult to just replace the brains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Four is I think we're going to move past the era of fixed pricing. Agents eat up a lot of tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they look expensive relative to chatbots. But the comparison that more and more people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">making is how much human time is it saving? So they're still cheap relative to human time saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And the fixed pricing model actually introduces a perverse incentive now where it's like selling gym</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">memberships, right? Like if I sold you a membership to my chatbot and you're now paying me, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">20 bucks a month, my incentive now is to push the inference cost as low as possible. And the easiest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">way to do that is to use dumber models. But dumber models just waste more of your time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, this is a long list. Hopefully it's not too tedious. But I think these are important points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The second-to-last point I'll make is I think the Unix philosophy is going to be more powerful here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">than vertical integration. So in developer tools, the ability to use simple tools in ways that compose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">well with other interesting tools is really powerful. And so I think, especially with agents where there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">less of a need to create like a lot of UI around it, you're going to start to see more command-driven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">tools, command line tools, and things like that. And then last but not least is, you know, we had an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">existing RAG chat coding assistant. Maybe some of you have used it. It was called Kodi. It still exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We're still supporting it. It's still in heavy use across, you know, many Fortune 500 companies. But we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">decided to build a new application from the ground up for the agentic world because we didn't want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">constrained by all the assumptions and constraints that we built into the application layer for the previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">generation of LLMs. And one analogy I like to draw here is, you know, what the early days of the internet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Like in the early days of the internet, the way people, you know, jumped into the the web was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">using an interface on the left. This was before like most people knew what the internet was about, what it was capable of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and that was the right interface for the first generation of the internet because like what can you do with the internet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, like there's a bunch of different things. You can look at like trending celebrities. You can, you know, buy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">automobiles. You can look at movie reviews, all these things you might not have thought of. And so it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">useful to have in front of you. But at some point it gets a little tedious like clicking through all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">different hyperlinks and navigating your way through. And then the the real power of the web was sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">unleashed by just like the one simple text box where you just like type what you're looking for and you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to it. And I think, you know, with with agentic UIs, that's what we should be striving for both in developer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">tools and in a lot of different application paradigms. Okay, so what does that look like in practice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we went to design this thing, our coding agent is called AMP. And AMP has two clients and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">is what they look like. So both are like very, very bare bones. A lot of people, you know, look at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and like, what is this? It's just a text box. What can I do with it? And that was by design, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that for all the reasons I just mentioned. One client is just a simple VS code extension</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that allows us to take advantage of some nice things that you get in VS code, like being able to view</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">diffs. That's really important in the agent decoding world. I often joke that like that's now I use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">view more than the editor view now. And the second was a CLI. So just stripping things down to bare bones. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">has access to all the same tools as the VS code extension does, but it's just something that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">can invoke in your command line. You can also script it, compose it with other tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So what does this actually look like in practice? I want to do something a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">risky here, which is in the past I've done a lot of like, you know, hey, here's me building a simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">app, like those sorts of demos. But I actually want to show off like where we think this is most useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like, hey, I'm working on an application that has real users. Let me actually make a contribution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to that code base, given all, with all the like existing constraints. And so I actually want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to code a little bit. Well, I don't even know how far we're going to get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is, this is AMP. This is VS code running AMP in the sidebar, and it's open to the AMP code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I want to do is implement like a simple change to this application. So the change that I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to make is AMP has a server component. And the server exists as a way to provide the LLM inference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">point. It also provides like team functionality. We have a way to share like what different teams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">are doing, what different users are doing with AI. So you can kind of learn from other users. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">leaderboard. It's fun. But there's also these things called connectors, which allow AMP to talk to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">external services. So our issue tracker is linear. And so I've integrated linear into AMP here, but I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of annoyed because it's using this generic like network icon. And I would really like to customize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this icon such that when you plug in the linear MCP endpoint, it uses a more appropriate icon like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">checkbox or something issue-y. So I've already filed this as a linear issue. And I'm just going to ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">can you find the linear issue about customizing the linear connector icon? Then implement it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this will do is it has access to a set of tools. I can go over here to the tool panel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and see what tools it has access to. Some are local, some are built in. It's got the standard tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like read and edit file or run bash command. You can also plug in things like Playwright and Postgres</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">via MCP. And then linear is also plugged in through this. So we're basically talking to the linear API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">through the MCP server. And what this will do is it will use the linear issues API. And it will search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">at issues. It found 50 issues. And the one that I was referring to is at the top here. So add a special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">icon for the linear connector. And now it's going to go and implement the thing for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing to note here is it's just making these tool calls on its own. I'm not asking it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to use specific tools. We've also tried to make the information that you see minimal. So you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">need to see all the API tool calls that it's making underneath the hood or crowd out the transcript with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">a bunch of things. Most of the time, we just want to keep it simple. Because the contract we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">provide to users is like, the feedback loops here are more robust. And you don't have to micromanage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">this as much. Another thing I want to point out here is the search tool that this is using is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a sub-agent. So it's actually spinning off a sub-agent loop that uses a form of agentic search. It has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">access to a bunch of different search tools. Keyword search, regular graph, looking at file names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to inspect what it's doing, you can click the expand thing and see what different path</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it's taking, what files it's reading, what things it uncovered. But again, by default, we think this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">an implementation detail. And hopefully, it should just surface the right thing. So it's working. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">gathering context. Another thing I want to call out in this interface is, as we've gotten more feedback,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we've kind of designed this thing to be more multi-threaded. So there's a quick keyboard shortcut that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">allows you to quickly tab through the different threads that you're running. And it's a common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">paradigm in our user community to be running more than one of these things at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it takes a little bit to get used to the context switching. Developers hate context switching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We like to be in flow, in focus. Typically, what we see here is the secondary thread will either be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">something that's a lot shallower, so that you can quickly page back to the main thread. Or what I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is, while the agent is working, I actually like to understand the code at a deeper level myself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">so I can better understand what it's going to do. So I could ask something like, "Can you show me how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">connectors and connections work in AMP?" I can ask it to draw a picture of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll kick that thread off in parallel. We'll check back in on what this guy is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's found -- it's read a bunch of files. It's read some front-end files. Our front-end is written</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in Svelte. And as you can see, it's being fairly thoughtful about reading the appropriate files</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">before it actually goes and does the work. And we find that this is really important to make the feedback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">cycles more robust. Otherwise, the anti-pattern is you just get into the weeds of steering it manually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also got this to-do list thing at the bottom that helps it structure and plan out the longer-term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks, so that it doesn't go immediately dive into the code. There's a classic mistake that human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">developers make too, where you dive into the code too early, and then you get lost in the weeds, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">it takes a while to dig yourself out. Okay, so it's making some changes. One other thing that I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to point out here is -- you know, I mentioned that I use the diff view in VS Code now probably more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the editor view. VS Code actually has a really nice diff view. I have a hot keyed, so I can open it up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly. And most of my time in VS Code now is spent just reviewing the changes it makes. And I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">like this a lot better than GitHub PRs or Git diff on the command line. Just because it's in the editor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see the whole file, and jump to definition even works. So, yeah. We'll just wait a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for it to do its thing. I actually think it's probably made -- looks like it's getting there. It's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">just running, like, tests. Let's see if we go back here, if it's updated the icon at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so it hasn't gotten there yet, but I think it's on the right track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The question was, does it write its own tests? Yes, it typically writes its own tests. And if it doesn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you can prompt it to do so. So, it's doing a lot of things. It's reading a lot of files. It's making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">these edits incrementally and then checking the diagnostics. And then now let's see if it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, cool. So, you see here the icon has been updated. And this is without me really steering it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">in any fashion. Notice here on this page that this icon didn't update, though. And so this is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">not surprising to me because this change -- as many changes in production code bases are -- often more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">nuanced than it seems at the surface. So, in this case, the reason it's not getting it here is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the admin page. And the piece of data we need to know -- we need to read in order to tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is a linear MCP rather than a generic MCP is actually part of the config. We have to look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the endpoint of the MCP URL. In order to do that, you have to read the config. But the config might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">also contain secrets. It doesn't contain secrets in this case, but might contain secrets in other cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we actually prohibit those secrets from being sent to non-admin pages. So, it's not surprising to me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that the first pass, it didn't get that right. But let's see if it can get -- I'll just nudge it a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">a bit. So, like, I noticed that the icon changed on admin connections, but not on settings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you investigate why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the interest of time, we'll check back on this later. How about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll let it run and we'll see if it can find its way to the right solution there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it okay if I go a little bit over since we started a little bit? Okay, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it okay with you all if I go a little bit over? Okay. Are you still having fun?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, cool. So, that was like a brief demo of just like the interaction patterns and the UI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We try to keep it really minimal. We've released this to like a small group so far. The sign-up is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">now publicly open. It's been open for about two weeks, but we haven't done a lot of like marketing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">around it. And that's kind of been intentional because we're really trying to design this for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">where we think the puck is going. And so, we've done a lot to curate this community of people who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to experiment with LLMs and figure out like how the interaction paradigms are going to change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">over the next six to 12 months. And so, our user community is really people who are like spending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">nights and weekends a lot of time with this thing to see what they can get it to do. And so, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the most insightful things and actually the main topic of this talk is lessons that we've learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">from just like looking at what our power users are doing and seeing what interesting behavior patterns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">they're kind of like implementing. And so, like the average spend for agents is growing. It's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">more than the average spend was for chatbots or autocomplete. But one other interesting thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we've noticed among the user base is that there's a huge variance in terms of how much people use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">think. To the point where like there's like an upper echelon of users that are spending like thousands of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars per month just in inference costs.

And we're like, that's interesting. What the hell are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you doing? And from those insights and the conversations, we basically have encapsulated a series of best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">practices or emergent power user patterns for how the very dominant users, the most active users are using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing. And this has informed our product design process as well. So one of the the first changes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that we made was we noticed that a lot of the power users were very writing very long prompts. It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">not like the simple kind of like Google style, like three keywords and just like read my mind and expect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">something good to happen. They actually wanted to write a lot of detail because they realized that LLMs are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">actually quite programmable. If you give them a lot of context, they will follow those instructions and get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit further than if you just give them like a one line sentence. And so we made the default</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior of the enter key in the AMP input just new line. So you have to hit command enter to submit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And this throws a lot of the new users off because they're like, wait a minute, why isn't it just enter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, if I'm in like cursor or whatever, it's just enter. That's easy. That's intuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, what we want to push users to do is to write those longer prompts because that actually yields</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">better results. And I think that's one of the things that prevents people who are still in the kind of like chat LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">mode from unlocking some of the, you know, cool stuff that agents can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that people do very intentionally is direct the agent to look at relevant context and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback mechanisms. So, you know, context was very important in the chat bot era. It's still important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in the agentic era. Now, agents do have a good amount of like built-in knowledge for how to use tools to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">acquire context. Like you saw that before when it was using the search tool to find different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was executing the test and linters to see if the code was valid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's still some cases, especially in production code bases, where it's like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we do things in a very specific way that are kind of like out of distribution. And so like some like less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">agentically inclined users at that point will just give up. They're like, ah, you know, agents aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">capable of working with like backend code yet. But what we've noticed is the power user like, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">let me try to just tell it how to run, you know, the build in this particular sub directory, run the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">tests. And that helps it complete the feedback loop so that it can get the validation to get further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Feedback loops are going to be a big theme of this talk. So another like dominant paradigm here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">constructing these like frontend feedback loops. So like a really common formula is you have the playwright</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">mcp server and then there's a thing called storybook, which is basically a way to encapsulate or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">componentize a lot of your fun components. It makes it very easy to test individual components without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">loading your entire app. And you know, you probably should have been doing this anyways as a human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">developer because you get a fast feedback loop. You make a change, see it reflected instantly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you get the auto reload and then go back to your editor. But with agents, you kind of notice it more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">because you're no longer like in the weeds doing the thing. You're like, oh, you're almost like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">developer experience engineer for your agent. It's like, how can I make it loop back faster? And so what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the agent will do is like, you know, make the code change, use playwright to open up the page in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">browser, snapshot it, and then loop back on itself. And it does that via storybook because it's much faster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">than reloading the entire app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You put playwright as a tool for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. So, it's one of the default recommended tools. So, it's right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, it looks like that run completed. I wonder if -- looks like it did approximately the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">right thing. Sorry, just to jump out of the slides of her a little bit. So, now you can see like the icon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">is customized on the settings page, not just the admin page. And if you look at how it did that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it did the right thing. So, if you look at the diff, it actually looked at the surrounding code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was like, oh, there is an existing mechanism for plumbing non-secret parts of the config through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to the UI. Let me use that as a reference point. And it actually plumbed exactly that field through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to the front end. So, now if I add additional fields to the MCP config that do contain secrets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">this is whitelisted. So, it will still only send the endpoint URL over to the client,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">basically what it needs to make that icon customization. So, yeah. I know it's not a super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">impressively visual change, but a lot of such changes in messy production code bases are like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's cool to see the agent be able to tease out that nuance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. I know we're a little bit over time. Can people mind if I keep going? Okay, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some additional tips and tricks. Most of this talk is just sharing what we've learned from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1669" target="_blank">00:27:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">our power users. So, another thing that we've noticed is this prevailing narrative that agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to make programmers lazy. It's going to make it so we don't really understand what's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">on in the code, so we're going to ship more slop. But we've actually found the inverse happen with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">power users. They're actually using agents to better understand the code. And so, this is a really good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">onboarding tool. We just hired this guy, Tyler Bruno. He's a very precocious young developer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">He's actually still in college, but he's working full-time in addition to taking classes. So, really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">bright, but also a bit green. He's been using AMP to just quickly ramp up on how the different pieces</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">connect together. He can draw diagrams and point you to specific pieces of the code. It's really good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">accelerating that. And then a corollary to this is we all do a form of onboarding to new code whenever we do a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">code review. By definition, code review is new code. And oftentimes, it's new code that contains</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">blogs or is hard to understand or is a bit of a slog. And so, rather than just ignore the code that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">AI generates and just commit it blindly, we find that our user base is actually using this tool to do more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">thorough code reviews. So, I've adopted this practice myself where if I have to review a very large diff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the first thing I do is ask the agent to consume the diff and generate a high-level summary so I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">have a high-level awareness. And then I ask it, "Hey, if you were a smart senior dev, what's the entry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">point into this PR?" Because often half the battle is just finding the right entry point. And psychologically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I often put off code reviews because I'm like, "Oh, it's going to be a pain, and it's going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">forever just to figure out where I should start reviewing it. So, I'll just do it tomorrow." But this thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">just like it helps lower that activation energy and make code views more thorough and actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">dare I say, like a little bit fun and enjoyable now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Sub-agents are also a thing. So, we implemented the search tool as a sub-agent in the very beginning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1787" target="_blank">00:29:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're seeing more and more use cases emerge for sub-agents. And the general best practice with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">sub-agents is that they often are useful for longer, more complex tasks because the sub-agent allows you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to essentially preserve the context window. So, like, the quality of the LLM will degrade over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Sonnet 4 has a context window of 200K, but we see degradation typically around like 120 or 130K.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the time you hit 170 tokens, you start to see more kind of like off-the-rails and crazy behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But sub-agents allow you to encapsulate the context used up by a specific sub-task, like implementing a small feature,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">such that it doesn't pollute the main agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, that was a quick tour of a lot of best practices. Just to recap, like the anti-practices,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the common anti-patterns are just like micromanaging the agent, like using it like you would a chatbot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">where you have to kind of like steer it at every interaction or review every edit it's making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Another common anti-pattern is just like under-prompting, so not giving it enough detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like LLMs, their knowledge comes from two places. It either comes from their training data or from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">context that you give it. And so, you know, it's fine if you do a five-word prompt if you're coding up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">like a 3D Flappy Bird game from scratch, because that's well represented in the training set. They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">really good at that. They're trained to do that. But if you're trying to make a subtle nuance change to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">your large existing code base, you should be giving it all the details that you would give a colleague</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">on the team to point them in the right direction. And then last but not least, like agents are not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">vehicle to like TLDR the code. If anything, they're the opposite. You should be using them to do much more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">thorough code reviews more quickly. The human is still, you're ultimately responsible for the code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that you ship, and you shouldn't view this as a human replacement. It's really a tool that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">wield to make yourself 10, 100x more effective. Last tidbit. So, one of the things that we've noticed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">among the very, very, very top 1% of the 1% is this inclination to run multiple of these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in parallel. Jeff Huntley, who wrote that blog post that I showed earlier, he started putting out these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Twitter streams. They're about four hours long each. And it's basically just, he's working on a compiler</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">on the side. And what he does is he constructs prompts for three or four different agents to work on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">different parts of the compiler. And he's gotten to the point where he's prompting it such that he feels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">confident enough in the feedback loops where he just hits enter, lets him run, and then he goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to sleep. And then this thing just runs on Twitter for a while. And I think he's doing this to spread</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the word. It's like, hey, you can use this for serious engineering. Compilers are not some vibe-coded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">weekend project. They're real tech. They're difficult to build. And it is possible to use agents for code like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">this. But it has to be a very intentional skill that you practice. And so I think it's cool. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of people thinking in terms of agent fleets and where the world is going. But I do think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that the way that we'll actually get there is by building these composable building blocks that allow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">people like Jeff to go and combine them and come up with interesting UIs. I think this is just running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in like Tmux or some window manager. Okay, so the takeaways I just want to leave you with is, one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">contrary to what some might say, and there's a lot of smart senior developers out there who think AI is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">overhyped, and maybe parts of it are. But I think coding agents are very real. And it is, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a high ceiling skill. It's like, I think we will probably invest in learning how to use these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">in the same way that we invest in learning how best to use our editor or our programming language of choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the only way you can learn this stuff is by doing it and then sharing it out with others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the reasons we built the thread sharing mechanism in AMP is to help encourage knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">dissemination so that like if you discover an interesting way of using it, you can share that out with your team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, that's it. If you want to kind of like see a recap of the best practices in this talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">we've actually put out like an AMP owner's manual that guides new users how to best use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll also be around afterwards. We have a booth in the main expo hall. I'm supposed to say, too,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">if you stop by the booth, we'll give you like $10 in free credits. So if anything you saw here was of interest of you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and you want to try this out, stop by and say hi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I noticed you still type, can you, and then you correct your typos, which I guess you said you shouldn't do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's part habit and it's part paranoia that in like a live demo setting, there will be some typo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">token that will trigger off the rails behavior. But it like, I think that was more of a concern that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">learned in like 2023 when it actually mattered. Because like these days, LMs are more and more like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">typo robust, I would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RyElT_gJk&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div></div></body></html>
