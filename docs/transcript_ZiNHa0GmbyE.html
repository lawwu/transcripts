He said, the long run is not where life is lived, right? It's a series of short runs. We were talking to a client a couple months ago who worked at Lehman Brothers.</p><p>This person is making a lot of money working on Wall Street. They have the ability to take a lot of risk. But this person realized, I don't care what that ability is, what the spreadsheet tells me. I can't physically or mentally make myself do that. So I wanna take a more conservative route with my portfolio regardless of what the results are gonna be.</p><p>I know my results would be better if I could invest more aggressively, but I have this mental block that's holding me back. And actually, I think that's the right decision as long as you don't take it too far.</p></div></div></body></html>
