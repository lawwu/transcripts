I got paid over $30 million for Tank Fight, yeah. Because the pay-per-view numbers, they were crazy, you know, $1.2 million sold. Y'all get it all at one time, right? Nah, it's like broken up because like the pay-per-view sales, like they got to come in.</p><p>$12 million check here, $10 million check later, $5 million. The numbers got to come in, so. People that want to be in your shoes for the money, for the women, for the fame, how fulfilling is that to you when you get it? It's like anything in life, short dopamine doesn't last.</p><p>The story of Solomon, he had all the women, he had everything, the riches, and at the end he said, this is all vanity. And honestly, that's what it is. It doesn't fulfill you in any real way. It's actually going to leave you empty. You're going to be by yourself and searching for, you know, what really mattered in life.</p></div></div></body></html>
