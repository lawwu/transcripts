So Spotify has, maybe you can correct me, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=7">00:00:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">over 50 million songs, tracks and over 3 billion playlists. So 50 million songs and 3 billion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=17">00:00:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">playlists, 60 times more playlists. What do you make of that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=23">00:00:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so the way I think about it is that from a statistician or machine learning point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=30">00:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of view, you have all these, if you want to think about reinforcement learning, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=35">00:00:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this state space of all the tracks and you can take different journeys through this world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=41">00:00:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think of these as people helping themselves and each other, creating interesting vectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=50">00:00:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">through this space of tracks. And then it's not so surprising that across many tens of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=55">00:00:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">millions of atomic units, there will be billions of paths that make sense. And we're probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=61">00:01:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty quite far away from having found all of them. So our job now is users, when Spotify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=69">00:01:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">started, it was really a search box that was for the time pretty powerful. And then I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=74">00:01:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to refer to it as this programming language called playlisting, where if you, as you probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=78">00:01:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">were pretty good at music, you knew your new releases, you knew your back catalog, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=83">00:01:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">knew your Star Way to Heaven, you could create a soundtrack for yourself using this playlisting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=86">00:01:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">tool that's like metaprogramming language for music to soundtrack your life. And people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=91">00:01:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">who were good at music, it's back to how do you scale the product. For people who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=95">00:01:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">good at music, that wasn't actually enough. If you had the catalog and a good search tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=99">00:01:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you can create your own sessions. You could create really good a soundtrack for your entire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=104">00:01:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">life, probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself. But the problem was most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=109">00:01:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">people, many people aren't that good at music. They just can't spend the time. Even if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=113">00:01:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">very good at music, it's going to be hard to keep up. So what we did to try to scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=117">00:01:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this was to essentially try to build, you can think of them as agents that this friend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=124">00:02:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that some people had that helped them navigate this music catalog. That's what we're trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=128">00:02:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to do for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=129">00:02:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But also there is something like 200 million active users on Spotify. So there, okay, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=140">00:02:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">from the machine learning perspective, you have these 200 million people plus they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=147">00:02:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">creating, it's really interesting to think of a playlist as, I mean, I don't know if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=155">00:02:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you meant it that way, but it's almost like a programming language. It's a release, a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=160">00:02:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">trace of exploration of those individual agents, the listeners, and you have all this new tracks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=170">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">coming in. So it's a fascinating space that is ripe for machine learning. So is there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=178">00:02:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is it possible, how can playlists be used as data in terms of machine learning and to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=186">00:03:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">help Spotify organize the music?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=188">00:03:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we found in our data, not surprising that people who playlisted a lot, they retained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=195">00:03:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">much better. They had a great experience. And so our first attempt was to playlist for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=199">00:03:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">users. And so we acquired this company called Tunigo of editors and professional playlisters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=206">00:03:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and kind of leveraged the maximum of human intelligence to help build kind of these vectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=213">00:03:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">through the track space for people. And that broadened the product. Then the obvious next,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=220">00:03:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and we use statistical means where they could see when they created a playlist, how did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=226">00:03:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that playlist perform? They could see skips of the songs, they could see how the songs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=229">00:03:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">perform and they manually iterated the playlist to maximize performance for a large group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=235">00:03:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of people. But there were never enough editors to playlist for you personally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=239">00:03:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of group personalization, using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=243">00:04:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">editors and tools and statistics to individualization. And then what's so interesting about the 3</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=251">00:04:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">billion playlists we have is, we ended, the truth is we lucked out. This was not a priority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=256">00:04:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy as is often the case. It looks really smart in hindsight was as dumb luck. We looked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=262">00:04:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">at these playlists and we had some people in the company, a person named Eric Bernadotton,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=268">00:04:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">who was really good at machine learning already back then in like 2007, 2008. Back then it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=275">00:04:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was mostly collaborative filtering and so forth. But we realized that what this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=281">00:04:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is people are grouping tracks for themselves that have some semantic meaning to them. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=286">00:04:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then they actually label it with a playlist name as well. So in a sense, people were grouping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=292">00:04:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">tracks along semantic dimensions and labeling them. And so could you use that information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=298">00:04:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to find that latent embedding? And so we started playing around with collaborative filtering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=307">00:05:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and we saw tremendous success with it. Basically trying to extract some of these dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=314">00:05:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think about it, it's not surprising at all. It'd be quite surprising if playlists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=320">00:05:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">were actually random, if they had no semantic meaning. For most people, they group these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=324">00:05:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">tracks for some reason. So we just happened to cross this incredible data set where people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=329">00:05:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are taking these tens of millions of tracks and grouped them along different semantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=334">00:05:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">vectors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=335">00:05:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the semantics being outside the individual users, so it's some kind of universal. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=341">00:05:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a universal embedding that holds across people on this earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=346">00:05:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, I do think that the embeddings you find are going to be reflective of the people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=350">00:05:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">playlisted. So if you have a lot of indie lovers who playlist, your embed is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=356">00:05:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">perform better there. But what we found was that, yes, there were these latent similarities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=364">00:06:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They were very powerful. And it was interesting because I think that the people who playlisted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=370">00:06:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the most initially were the so-called music aficionados who were really into music. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=376">00:06:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they often had a certain... Their taste was often geared towards a certain type of music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=383">00:06:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what surprised us, if you look at the problem from the outside, you might expect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=387">00:06:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that the algorithms would start performing best with mainstreamers first, because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=392">00:06:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream taste than really particular taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=397">00:06:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the complete opposite for us. The recommendations performed fantastically for people who saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=402">00:06:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves as having very unique taste. That's probably because all of them playlisted and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=408">00:06:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they didn't perform so well for mainstreamers. They actually thought they were a bit too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=411">00:06:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">particular and unorthodox. So we had the complete opposite of what we expected. Success within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=417">00:06:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the hardest problem first, and then had to try to scale to more mainstream recommendations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=421">00:07:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">[silence]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=426">00:07:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">[silence]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=431">00:07:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">[silence]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TWgsvF4hBQ&t=436">00:07:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">[silence]</span></div></div></body></html>
