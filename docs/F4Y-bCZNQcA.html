Over 80% of the time people preferred VO3's output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But before I get to the obligatory 45 seconds worth of samples, a quick word on price and availability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Only the $250 tier Google AI Ultra will get access to VO3 currently.

With that caveat said, in these clips notice both the dialogue that's generated by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">VO3 and the sound effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the longest side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yo, check the footage, put it to the test. Our video model, yeah, it's the best. Straight up, no cap, you know how we do. VO3 rules, yeah. The whole damn crew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">If you thought that yesterday's IO was just VO3 plus a sprinkle of other bits then you might well be in for a surprise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I don't know if you caught this but the Gemini 2.5 flash update was a price shock akin to the DeepSeek R1 bombshell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Think performance on par with DeepSeek R1 at one quarter of the price. And this is comparable performance with much more expensive models whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about general knowledge, tough science questions, mathematics or coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure if you guys caught this but Gemini 2.5 flash also has native audio generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can control what one speaker or multiple speakers say, their accent and even instructions like giggling, sighing or groaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This is for 24 languages by the way and the model can switch between languages in the same output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The next thing isn't here yet so take it with a grain of salt but Demesis Arbis described a universal AI assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And this might remind you of something but they demoed an agent that could make calls on your behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We've seen that one before but this seems real and also shop for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A bit like OpenAI's operator but all in one package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now yes this might seem theoretical but live as of yesterday across all of Android is Gemini Live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Open the Gemini app, tap the bottom right button and you can share what your camera sees in your phone and have a live conversation with Gemini.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The next thing that caught my eye isn't a new feature or a new model but two statements that Google CEO made that I found pretty interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">First as you can see it's not just that 400 million people are now using Gemini every month, they're using it more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So as compared to this time last year there are 50 times the number of tokens or let's say words being generated by Gemini AI models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you guys saw this before anyone but AI is not a fad, it's not going anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The next statement, not feature or model, was a cheeky slap at OpenAI for their recent struggles with models being sycophantic, flattering the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You might not have noticed this reference, but I think Google was making a pretty clear statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Sick convertible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Garbage truck again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything else?</span></div><div

lawn?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a package, it's a utility box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is this person

following you, that's just your shadow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.760</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:04:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The next announcement that will almost certainly be a video when it's actually released was of course Gemini 2.5 Pro DeepThink.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Officially only available on that $250 tier, but I think I'm going to be able to get access in the next couple of days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's of course to run it on SimpleBench, but we already have some scores where this DeepThink mode outperforms not just Gemini 2.5 Pro Vanilla, but O3 and O4 Mini from OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, on coding, but also mathematics quite dramatically and multimodality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the MMMU, which is about analyzing charts, graphs and other visuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Essentially, Google's claim here is that with DeepThink, you will have access to the smartest model on the planet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, we will have to test that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's just say that by tomorrow there might be other contenders, hint, hint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But Google did give us a slight nod as to how it performs so well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I listened to various surrounding interviews and, of course, the full three hours of video materials from the IO, and they kept hinting about parallel samples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, hmm, that sounds familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I covered the bombshell Google paper that talked about sampling and scaling up inference time search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This was on a recent Patreon video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But for those who aren't going to see that video, it basically said that scaling up these samples that you analyze in a modular approach can beat scaling up the length of chain of thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The key author called this yet another axis in which the AI labs can scale up their compute spend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Onto something which I think they have massively overhyped in the past, which is AI overviews, which is incredibly untrustworthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, they focused on its successes and how it scaled up to 1.5 billion, quote, users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">While I do wonder how many of those 1.5 billion users were given erroneous results, they did announce that in future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think from now, it will be powered by a custom 2.5 model, probably something akin to Gemini 2.5 flash light.</span></div><div

quite significantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't normally feature something like this, but for something that's going to be used by billions of people, I think it is significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">While we're on search, I have to mention AI mode, which for me is Google's attempt to be a perplexity killer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, you can engage in a back and forth conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">By the summer, apparently, it's going to be able to book things for you like an agent, perform deep researches and do data analytics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, none of those features might be new to any of you guys, but it does show that Google is preparing rapidly for the days where that classic search bar is replaced by AI mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaking of Google deep research, that too has seen a pretty big upgrade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The model behind it has been upgraded, and if you are on the pro tier, you get the full 2.5 pro to power it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, like OpenAI deep research, you can now use your own files, but I think there is something much cooler about the new deep research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I'm going to be totally honest with you guys, but I found the original deep research very verbose, like it would always generate these 20 page reports, even if I asked for something quite simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed, that was the case when I asked it just now, find out 50 incredible facts about Alpha Evolve, my previous video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But now Google deep research is integrated with their canvas feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can instantly turn that deep research report into an interactive website, for example, or maybe just a chart, a table or a podcast using notebook LM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So while it's good to be comprehensive, I now think most users will have something that they can use on a daily basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaking of coding, I'll quickly throw in Google's jewels, which is the rival to OpenAI's codex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it's just a few hours before, but with jewels, anyone can sign up and it's free up to five tasks per day powered by 2.5 pro.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, I'll have to test it side by side, but jewels can import your GitHub repo, clone it virtually on the cloud, verify different changes actually work, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you are new to all of that, Google have produced a replic rival.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This was featured in the developer session, but essentially you can not only develop an app,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but also deploy it on Google Cloud Run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, they are fairly basic apps that you can create for now, but other people can essentially see what you've made and try it out and enjoy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go back to some sweet visuals with Imagine4, their latest text to image model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In their promotional materials, Google leaned into the finer details that Imagine4 can do, as well as text fidelity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you see this image of sheep in a field with knitted yarn, I tried the exact same prompt in GPT image one and got this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But rather than just rely on a sample size of one, they actually showed us some benchmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's a busy chart, but Google is essentially admitting that GPT image one still outperforms Imagine4 on ultra settings, but takes a lot longer to generate its images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So for text to image, it's probably fair to say Google has caught up to OpenAI and that image generation model you see in ChatGPT, but hasn't surpassed OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will say that if it's speed you're looking for, look no further than Gemini Diffusion, the model that no one saw coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not out yet, I'm on the wait list, but it is a totally different way of doing language modelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll summarise how it works in a second, but first, how fast does it work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you can see the prompt and there's the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Google say that the Gemini Diffusion model is five times faster than their fastest current model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you could just pause and think through the implications of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine in the near future, an instant app developed just with a voice prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">How can it possibly be that fast?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Diffusion models work differently to auto-regressive or token by token language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a quick analogy I came up with, let me know if you like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost all language models you are familiar with work by predicting the probability of a set of possible next words in the sequence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Diffusion models can work on the entire output at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a bit like the difference between one person rapidly placing Lego blocks to build up an entire statue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's auto-regressive models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">With Diffusion models, it's a bit like having a giant cube of Lego bricks and you're trying to make that statue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You already have the cube and 100 like-minded people each come along and take or add a block from that cube for a few turns until the statue is revealed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Going from a block of noise to a sculpted statue in far less time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But do you have to sacrifice performance?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the early benchmarks say probably not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Depends on the domain, of course, and we'll all have to do plenty of testing, but the signs look good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">As I mentioned at the start of this video, this announcement alone, Gemini Diffusion, could have been an entire video and hopefully one day soon will be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">On a much lighter note, of course, I can't help but mention the new try it on feature from Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure all of you guys and gals will be using this almost immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But the interesting bit for me was that Google made their own bespoke image generator model just so that you could input a photo of yourself and try different fashionable items on before you buy them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, might not be as crazy impressive as the other announcements, but designing a bespoke model for that is a little bit of a flex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing I thought I would quickly flag up is that Google announced a Synth ID detector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it's fairly old news that Google adds a Synth ID watermark to its text and its images and videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But the Synth ID detector, I think, is worth flagging up because they're inviting journalists, academics and other researchers to be able to input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">input a certain image or text and get the answer as to whether Google thinks it was done by Gemini or indeed Imagine or VO3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So just be aware that everything you create with Google isn't just watermarked, but now there are third parties who will be able to detect that watermark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y-bCZNQcA&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we get to possibly the coolest development, let me introduce you to the 80,000
