One has that many of the characteristics of the other. And sometimes I think the only thing that really separates the two is that the fraudster is able to keep getting money, raising money in order to get through the really difficult time where he or she isn't telling the truth.</p><p>And then that person goes down in history as a visionary. But because no one ever looks back to the moment in time when they were lying, the fraudster gets caught in the middle. So Enron's lost access to the capital markets, lost access to funding. As the market collapsed after the dot-com boom, and people began to wonder whether Skilling was telling the truth about Enron's broadband business, and then there were all the disclosures about Andy Fasta's partnerships.</p><p>If Enron had been able to continue raising money, this business of Enron's called Enron Broadband might well have been Netflix. It was Netflix ahead of its time.</p></div></div></body></html>
