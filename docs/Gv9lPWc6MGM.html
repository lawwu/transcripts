We live in, this is what we might call the Christian life or the daily Christian experience. It's issues dealing with sanctification, issues dealing with overcoming anger or overcoming anxiety or becoming more of a servant or becoming more disciplined in the Christian life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are all issues dealing with sanctification, and we're often tempted to jump right into sanctification issues without laying the groundwork of justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is true of the ministry of biblical counseling. Biblical counseling focuses on issues dealing with sanctification, and we as biblical counselors are very tempted to often jump right into issues dealing with sanctification, telling our counselees that they should stop being selfish and start being selfless, that they should stop being lazy and start being disciplined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We do need to do that in biblical counseling, but I just want you to note that Paul's train of thought is very important. First, he lays the groundwork of justification before he addresses issues of sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The encouragement that I want to bring to us tonight is that like the apostle Paul, we as biblical counselors must never assume that our counselees understand justification, and if they do understand justification, we must never assume that they understand justification too well or too thoroughly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul knew that if he was to go hard after the issues of sanctification, that he needed to take his time to lay the groundwork of justification in their hearts and minds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might be saying, "Well, is the doctrine of justification practical? I mean, is it really relevant for biblical counseling? I mean, isn't justification something that you explain to your counselee just so you can kind of get it out of the way? I mean, does it really have relevance to our everyday lives? Can we actually use the doctrine of justification to help our counselees with the issues of life?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's go back to Romans 5, verse 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul says, "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, past reality, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Through Him, we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.

Some great statements there again by Martin Luther. Luther wrote that this doctrine, justification by faith, is the head and the cornerstone.

It means to declare someone righteous in a legal or forensic sense. It does not mean to make one righteous in a moral or practical sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The term "logizimi" means to count or to credit or to reckon.

Justification involves a double imputation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Justification involves a double imputation. The first imputation, our sins imputed to Christ's account. The second imputation, Christ's righteousness imputed to our account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">2 Corinthians 5 verse 21, "For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3353" target="_blank">00:55:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">R.C. Sproul has that great illustration. If you have a billion dollar credit card debt that you could never pay off if you work for a hundred years and some great rich benefactor came along and in a moment's time paid your credit card debt in full, Sproul says, "What would you be?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">He says you would be bankrupt. It is true you would not owe a billion dollars on your credit card, but you also would have no money of your own. You would be debt free, but you would also be penniless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You would have received amazing grace if someone would pay off your debt, but you would not be rich because you would have no money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But Sproul says, say that same rich benefactor comes to you and not only pays your billion dollar credit card debt in full so that the enormous debt you carried is now removed, but he also makes a transfer from his bank account of a billion dollars of positive funds into your bank account at the same time he pays your debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What would you be if that double blessing was received? You would not just be debt free. You would now be rich, and you would be rich indeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Sproul uses that illustration to highlight the importance of this double imputation. The truth is that we owed more than a billion dollar credit card debt. We owed an infinite payment that we could never pay because we had sinned against the Holy God, and we have received a righteousness that is worth infinitely more than a billion dollars that would be credited to a person's bank account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The point being this, justification is a double imputation. It's not just that Christ pays all of my debt. It is also that Christ gives me all of his righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3489" target="_blank">00:58:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">As Wayne Grudem writes, if Christ had only earned forgiveness of sin for us, then we would not merit heaven. Christ had to live a life of perfect obedience to God in order to earn righteousness for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3501" target="_blank">00:58:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">He had to obey the law for his whole life on our behalf so that the positive merits of his perfect obedience would be counted for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3511" target="_blank">00:58:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes this is called Christ's active obedience, while his suffering and dying for our sins is called his passive obedience. It is not just moral neutrality that Paul knows he needs from Christ, that is a clean slate with sins forgiven, but a positive moral righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ had to fulfill all righteousness for our sake. Unless he had done this for us, we would have no record of obedience by which we would merit God's favor and merit eternal life with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a number of passages found there on your handout, but let me move to truth number three at the bottom of that page there, the lasting consequences of justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So justification has lasting consequences. We want to do away with this idea that when you become a Christian, you become justified, and then you kind of take the doctrine of justification and you put it aside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And you just get really serious about sanctification, but you get rid of the doctrine of justification, or at least don't make it central in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That was not Paul's approach to the Christian life, as you see from the epistle to the Romans. According to Paul, the Christian life begins with justification, and then we return time and time again back to the doctrine of justification as the basis and foundation for our sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3603" target="_blank">01:00:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We go back to the doctrine of justification in order to get joy, in order to get hope. Romans 5.9, "Since therefore we have been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3621" target="_blank">01:00:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that we do minister to people who struggle more on the libertine side, who struggle more with antinomianism and just kind of saying, "Because I have the grace of God, I can do whatever I want."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And we do need to be able to minister to those counselees. But I do want you to know there are counselees who really struggle with condemnation, who struggle with legalism, who struggle with feeling that God is never happy with them, that they can never do enough, that they can never measure up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3656" target="_blank">01:00:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Their prayer lives are dry, and their prayer lives are very formal because they don't know the blessings of coming to God their Father on the basis of Christ's righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3669" target="_blank">01:01:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they just have this sort of very dry and formal relationship with God. You find counselees oftentimes when they sin, that functionally, although they say they're not Catholic, functionally, they are performing some kind of penance in their relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">They sin and they say, "Well, I have to do these acts of service, and then I can work my way back into God's good favor." And they're not enjoying the blessings of their justified status before God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to do away with this notion that you can simply get to the imperatives of the Christian life without grounding yourself in your justified status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3714" target="_blank">01:01:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I appeal to the sequence of Paul's train of thought in Romans 3-5. Before he gets to sanctification, he spends much time in justification, and that is in his ministry to believers, not to unbelievers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have this much more language. I love the statement by Douglas Moo in his commentary to the Romans. Just listen to this and see if this resonates at all with your experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">He's talking about the effect that the doctrine of justification ought to have on our hearts. He writes in this paragraph, Paul invites us to join with him in celebrating the marvelous benefits conferred upon the justified believer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3760" target="_blank">01:02:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The apostle speaks as one who is extremely happy and full of joy.

In fact, we might almost say singing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3770" target="_blank">01:02:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The word peace moves beyond the largely negative signification of the word in secular Greek peace as cessation or absence of hostilities to a more positive nuance, the well-being, prosperity, or salvation of the godly person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3784" target="_blank">01:03:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">This background defines for us what Paul means by peace with God, not an inner sense of well-being or feeling of peace, but the outward situation of being in relationship of peace with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Those who understand their justified status before God sing. Christians sing. Christians sing because we're justified. We don't chant. We don't just mumble. We sing because of this great doctrine of justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">On the last page of your handout, I just want you to note this. This is the how much more language. It reminds me of that infomercial or those infomercials you may have watched them on TV where they're always saying, and that's not all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">If you buy this for $29.95, four easy payments, you also get this great cutlery set.

That's the language of Romans 5 where Paul says, since we have been justified by faith, we've received this imputed righteousness, and we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You might be saying, well, that's all that there is to say. There isn't anything more. I mean, isn't that enough to have peace with God, to have a standing in grace, but then you have throughout the book of Romans this much more language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3896" target="_blank">01:04:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse three, not only that, but rejoice in our sufferings. Verse nine, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. Verse 11, more than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter eight, verse one, there is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Just a practical counseling note there. People who are suffering or who have been diagnosed with a physical illness or who have received a great calamity in their lives may struggle with, is this God punishing me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3932" target="_blank">01:05:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a biblical counselor, you need to be able to bring the truths of Romans 5 to 8 to bear upon that counseling situation and minister the truth that whatever this is, it is not condemnation. It is not punishment because Christ has satisfied God's wrath on our behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">How much more will God bless us now that we have been justified by faith?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3960" target="_blank">01:06:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So Carl Truman tells a story and I'll close with this. It is well known in his writings and table conversation, Luther would often refer to visits from the devil, how the devil would come to him and whisper in his ear, accusing him of all manner of filthy sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3973" target="_blank">01:06:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Martin, you are a liar, greedy, lecherous, a blasphemer, a hypocrite. You cannot stand before God. To which Luther would respond, well, yes, I am.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3982" target="_blank">01:06:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And indeed, Satan, you do not know the half of it. I have done much worse than that. And if you care to give me your full list, I can no doubt add to it and help make it more complete. But you know what? My Savior has died for all my sins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=3997" target="_blank">01:06:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Those you mentioned and those I could add, and indeed those I have committed, but am so wicked that I am unaware of having done so. It does not change the fact that Christ has died for all of them. His blood is sufficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the day of judgment, I shall be exonerated because he has taken all my sins on himself and clothed me in his own perfect righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9lPWc6MGM&t=4022" target="_blank">01:07:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">As C.
