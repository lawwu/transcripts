So I'm going to just start and ask you a question since, and we'll get into a lot of why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you're an expert here, but what do you think the most common misconception is around how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wealthy people, high net worth people are spending and managing their money?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, I would say if I look at it, I don't know if this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a misconception or not, but what struck me is different from honestly the way I do things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">myself and the way I see a lot of other people do things maybe who are not in the high net worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">demographic is how light on debt they are. We do a benchmarking survey where we look at overall how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">people allocate their portfolios and how much debt they hold and that sort of thing. I would say a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">full 50% of the members of our group don't have any debt of any sort on their house. A quarter of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">them don't own a primary residence at all and then another quarter own their residence outright.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's 80% of members have less than 25% of their assets is debt. So to kind of put that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">concrete terms, if you had 10 million of assets, it would mean you had less than 2 million of debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think if you look at general stats about the American population, et cetera,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got a much higher debt to assets ratio than you see among this group. And it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's a risk averse group. These are people who have started companies, work at hedge funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">work in venture capital, people who are willing to take a lot of risk. But I think one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons they're comfortable taking that risk is they go quite light on debt or leverage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">however you want to phrase it. Yeah, it's fascinating. So let's rewind. You brought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">up a few things. We're going to get to this benchmarking survey, but I just want to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a little about long angle. So you talk a little about what it is and why you started it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, sure. So I started this group about two years ago with my friend Sri Ram. We've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">friends actually since I think freshman year of high school. I remember watching the Smurfs with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">him after school some days. But what led us to start this is that shortly after college,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we were both in consulting and then decided we wanted to kind of give it a try ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of starting our own company. So we started a software company and we ran that for about 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">years. And we bootstrapped it, which means we basically didn't take any outside venture capital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">In practical terms, it meant we didn't make any money ourselves. We didn't take any salary out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. We just rolled every dollar we made back into the company. And then after about 10 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we were fortunate enough to sell it to a strategic acquirer. So it meant from a kind of a personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">finance dimension, we made no money until our mid-30s. And then on one day, we got our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">compensation for the last 10 years of effort. And so we were quite abruptly introduced to all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">high net worth personal finance things, whether it's estate taxes, alternative assets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">umbrella insurance, et cetera. For a variety of reasons, we didn't want to go the model of just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "Hey, Goldman Sachs, here's all my money. You guys are in charge. You take it from here."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We wanted to sort of manage things ourselves, but we realized we had a lot to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we basically wanted to set up a group of friends of ours who were all in a similar situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">financially and where nobody was trying to sell each other anything. And that's really still what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we're doing.

I think there's this impression of, "Hey, everybody out there is moving to Puerto</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Rico and doing 1031 exchanges and doing all these clever things that ends up with effective no tax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">rate."

But actually, if we look at overall membership, only about 40% of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">have any sort of third party, whether it's a multifamily office, RIA, wealth manager, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">About 60% of them do not.

I think if I look at our membership, you get to a certain level and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I aspire to be there, but not there myself. If you're over, say, 50 or 100 million, I think it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">just starts to get to this level of complexity that even just managing the paperwork and dealing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with the tax returns, you really can't do that by yourself unless it's really your 100% job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So people do hire and help to that. But below that kind of level, I'd say most people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at least in our group, are managing everything themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And managing it yourselves doesn't mean you don't have an assistant, or you don't have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">bookkeeper, or you don't have someone that files your taxes. It just means you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">paying someone a percentage of all of your assets to manage your investment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's exactly right. I'd say almost everybody has a CPA who's doing their taxes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and that can be a very reasonable amount of money. Somebody can be making $2 million a year and only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">pay $1,000 or $2,000 a year for somebody to file their taxes. It does not need to be a backbreaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">amount of money. And I actually think at a certain point, it's just silly not to hire somebody else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to do it because you can have all the good intentions in the world, but it's really easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to misread the tax code at a certain level and either underpay or overpay. And I'm not sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which is worse. I don't think people want to be doing either one. So certainly, as you're saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, bookkeepers and assistants and that sort of thing. But I think just this principle of saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to pay somebody half a percent or a percent a year just to tell me to put something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">into a 60/40 index fund is... Now, I will say our group tends to be younger, as I said, in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">30s and 40s. And overwhelmingly, probably 95% of people didn't grow up with this kind of wealth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but generated themselves at some point along the way. So I think probably has a relatively high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">dose of self-confidence in their ability to do it. So probably a bit of selection bias there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not an unconventional approach. One thing when it comes to taxes, even if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't want to hire a CPA forever, I would encourage everyone to hire someone for one year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or even I found that as part of a sales tactic, most of the accountants I've talked to file taxes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when they get to know you, they say, "Hey, why don't I review your last year's return?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're still within the window of being able to refile if you mess something up. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't say I found any glaring mistakes from when I was doing it myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But even when I hired a firm that was not that great, the next firm I ended up hiring was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Well, here's a couple things you could have done differently." And so I found that at almost all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">levels, hiring someone to do this pays for itself in what they're able to understand and file for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you. So I think that if I filed my taxes myself, forgetting the time it would take, I would actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">end up not filling out the right things and ending up making less at the end of the year than I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if I paid someone. I agree. And I think there's also value to have somebody throughout the years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you're trying to make decisions, you can bounce ideas off of. So for example, we own a home in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Southern California we used to live in, and we've moved since then. And I'd like to sell it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just a hassle to manage. But then I had concerns about, "Okay, if I sell it, is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have big tax implications?" And having somebody who I've worked with for a number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">years knows my whole situation.

And one of the things I think is really interesting is that so many of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">benchmarking surveys exist.

Yeah, I think it was both. I don't know if I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">break down exact percentages. But yeah, the fact is the market's down something like 20%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">over the last year, whereas the real estate market's gone down a little bit lately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's probably up. And alts have also done well. So I think some of it's market-driven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, your question about qualitatively, I can say with confidence that people... And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">partly because we asked in the survey, "What are you personally doing to change your allocation?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is something people are intentionally doing of feeling like the environment that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we were in before is not the one we're in now. And so something like real estate, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">two years ago, that was probably a fantastic buy. You had 2.5% debt that you could get on things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and very reasonable expectations of inflation at two to three times that level. So that was a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">smart move to do. I'd say today, something like real estate is less attractive. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">higher interest rates tend to make public stocks less attractive. So I think we are seeing people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">intentionally trying to increase their allocation, especially to alternatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a couple of others to dive into the details, things that people may find surprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I mentioned earlier on here that about a quarter of our members don't own their own home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would say for almost everybody, that is by choice. It's not a matter of, "If you've got $5</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">million, you could afford to buy a house." But again, asking people qualitatively, "Why don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you buy a home?" I would say it probably falls in two categories. There's a set of people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just don't want to live in any one place. These often tend to be the people without kids, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they're nomads and say, "Okay, I want to be in Mexico City for the next three months. Then I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">want to be in Switzerland. And I just don't see a point in owning a house if I do that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's also a lot of people who just don't want the sort of mental burden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the time burden, the financial risk, et cetera, associated with owning. They would rather just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">rent and know, "I'm going to pay this. And if the lights need to be changed, the plumbing breaks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the roof leaks, that's not my problem. I'm just going to call the landlord and tell him to deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with it." So that's a big thing. And then if you look at the three-quarters of people who do own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a home, again, a quarter of those don't have a mortgage on it. So you have pretty much fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">half of members without a mortgage. So I found that interesting. And another thing on the personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">real estate is that, leaving aside the caveat I had that there's a material percentage of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who don't own a home, if you look at those who do, up to about $50 million, the home continues</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to be a pretty significant piece of people's net worth. If you get somebody who's a billionaire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, their primary residence is probably not a big part of their portfolio. But somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">could have over $25 million and still have 10% or 15% of their net worth in their home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's something else that's interesting to me is how much people's primary residence value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">continues to scale along with their net worth.

The reason that real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">estate often turns out to be a very good investment is that you're putting in 20%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">25% of your own money and 75%, 80% of somebody else's money.

But that is not a universal answer. That was the case when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">interest rates were down at 2% or 3%. And I think anybody who is looking at government policy and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that sort of thing knew that inflation was going to be a lot higher than that. That's not the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">environment we're in anymore. Rates have gone up 3% over the last number of months. And you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing I think the highest average mortgage rates we've seen in the last 20 years. So you can still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">take on debt, but you're paying way more for that. And so it's unlikely to be that same wealth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">generator now. So I think you need to look at your own situation, but also just look at what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the overall economic environment. And this doesn't just go for real estate. This goes for other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">asset classes. If you look at bonds two years ago, I didn't hold any. In my opinion, that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a terrible investment. If you look at something that's a 30-year bond that's yielding 2%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no uncertainty. Mathematically, if you hold that to maturity over the next 30 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to earn 2% a year. And there's near total certainty that inflation is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to be higher than that. So you're basically locking yourself into losing money over 30 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that environment by the flip side has become a lot more attractive. Personally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I still don't buy bonds because I'm not that compelled by a 5% rate, a 4% rate, but that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">way better than the 2% you had before. So I think across any asset class, there's not one universal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, here's the right answer. Here's a portfolio that makes sense." You have to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhat reactive to the situations you see it. And unfortunately, you only get to live your life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">once. And it may be that ideally, when you're 28, you'd like to buy a home, but it's not a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">environment to buy a home. You just have to react to that fact, but you need to look at a combination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of what's going on internally and externally for you. I will also add right now, because I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there are people, especially in my friend group, that are like, "I finally have the money for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">down payment, but interest rates are so high." I will say two things. One, I have noticed even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Bay Area, that there've been a lot of price decreases. So if you factor in the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that you might get the house a lot cheaper than you would have a year ago, that could be an impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second is, you're never locked into 7%. If you get a mortgage right now, and it is 7%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and hopefully, for the sake of those people that that comes down quickly, if mortgage rates drop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">back down in three years, you can always go ahead and refinance. And so funny enough, I had been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doing some calculus, or calculations at least, when I was trying to decide whether we got a 30-year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage or a 10-year mortgage. And I was looking at the breakeven point on the 10-year mortgage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not 10 years. In my worst case scenario math, I was saying, "Okay, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">at the end of the 10-year period, rates go up to 7%. And now I'm paying way higher than 2.5% or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever I would have done on the 30-year mortgage." And the breakeven point was still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like 12 or 13 years. And so what that meant was, if I had gotten a 10-year mortgage and paid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say, half a percent lower than my 30-year fixed for 10 years, and then it rose up to 7%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the savings I got for those first years actually was totally made up for by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">even having to pay 7% for three years. So if you inverse that and say, "If I get a mortgage now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and for three years, I have to pay 7%, and then after that, I can refinance," the net effect over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a decade or more is not going to be as impactful. And probably, and I have not done any math,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not financial advice, but probably not going to outweigh the fact that you might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">able to get the house at a significantly better deal right now, because so many people are scared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">off by mortgage rates. Yeah, I would agree with that. The only other hack I would add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in the world of buying a house. So I bought three houses since my wife and I have gotten married.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have followed the same strategy on all of them. And I've been very happy with the purchase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on each one. And that has basically been looking for houses that have been on the market for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a year, two years, and they came on way too high, nobody wanted it. And so then after a while,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they started cutting, they kept cutting and kept cutting. And to the point where we bought it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in each case, it was about 30% below where they'd originally brought it on. And I am confident that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">any one of those, if they had brought it on just at the right price at the beginning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it would have sold right away would have sold for more than we paid.

But we also didn't want to pre buy space we didn't need. So we found a house</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that had three bedrooms, but it had a private entrance for one of the bedrooms. And we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">basically converted that to a studio and rented it out. We locked the door from the inside between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that bedroom and the rest of our house. It didn't have a kitchen. But you know, in the Bay Area,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there are lots of young people who either work at a company that provides them all their meals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or don't mind cooking and, you know, in a microwave and going out to eat and all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for almost a decade, we rented a room out in our house.

And we are in a financial position to not need the rental income anymore. To make the make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the mortgage payments. Now, all of a sudden, we're like, now we've just upgraded from a two bedroom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to a three bedroom, but we didn't have to move. And we had that extra income. So right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that could be a great opportunity.

Now I knowing everything I know, the cost to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">cut a hole in a house and put a door is probably actually not as much as I thought. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">early on, I was like only looking at houses that were set up for this. Knowing what I know now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you could look for any house and relative to the cost to buy a house, the cost to cut a hole and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">put a door is actually going to be pretty insignificant. So it doesn't even have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be perfectly situated for this, it could just, you know, be perfectly situated for you to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that modification. And then the second one, which most people have told me is a terrible idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but I've done it twice, and I like it. So this is again, not not advice for you. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I've gone to a house that we found the house we'd like to ourselves, we found it on Redfin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">or Zillow or somewhere, we went and looked at it. And then we convinced the selling agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to be the our agent also, which is called a dual agency. And so the seller's agent now represents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">both the buyer and the seller, they have to get permission from the seller to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you find someone that is, you know, you reasonably would trust to act fair and impartial,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're legally required to do that. So you have both the law, but also you want someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2067" target="_blank">00:34:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that you feel like can ethically handle that circumstance, you end up in a situation which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they make two commissions if you buy the house, and they make one commission if anyone else buys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the house. So I will say they are very motivated for you to buy the house. And so I think in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as a seller, I don't know if I would ever do this. Maybe I would do it if if I could agree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that the agent would rebate me a significant part of that commission back. But as a seller,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you know, I want I don't want someone to be motivated by one buyer, I want somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to be motivated by the highest price. As a buyer, I would much rather want an agent who's motivated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to sell to me than anyone else. And so in both scenarios, I think we got an, we were able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">close and purchase contract before other higher offers came in, in some cases by hours. And in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">some cases by by by a day, but you know, we were able to make an offer on the house we're in now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">before it went on the market, and and have it accepted. And the backup offers that came in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">were higher than our offers, at least as best I understand it. So that's my little hack, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't do as a seller, but as a buyer has worked well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I like that hack. And you know, I would build on it. I think that works the way you did it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that works great in a competitive market where the challenge for you is to actually get the buy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you say, hey, maybe today's markets not so hot, you know, I've got time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's more of a buyer's market, or maybe a more balanced market. But I think you can easily flip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that around. And I haven't done this myself. But I have a friend who's done this several times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">where he'll put in an offer, and he'll write into his offer, you know, I'm not represented by an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">agent. And part of my offer is that the seller is no longer paying a 6% commission, they're only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">paying a 3% commission. So he's basically saying, hey, when you look at my offer here, and maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I'm bidding 970,000, my competitor is bidding a million, but you, Mr. Owner, are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to net the same amount because I am explicitly stating that that commission goes back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">seller, then I think, you know, you can basically get a lower price on it. Again, it's not something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done. But I think it's the flip side. If it's not a competitive market, if it's more of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a buyer's market, you can use that as a way to find a lower price that's not going to hurt your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">seller. Yeah, when we did it, we actually the first time, the second time, this didn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But the first time we convinced the agent to rebate the 1% of their commission back to us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2216" target="_blank">00:36:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning one of the 6%, not 1% of their overall thing. So you know, we were able to bid a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">higher because we were getting it back. I've never thought about what you just described,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like just take the commission out, and then you can offer lower. So those are fun hacks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if you're buying a house in this market and want to try to find a way to get it get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">best deal. But I want to jump back in. So we're talking about real estate as part of your portfolio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we talked about what happened to stocks.

Typically, these secondaries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">will have a discount and you'll say, "Well, I'll give you $800,000 for that million dollars of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">shares in Sequoia."

And then finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you've just got a whole grab bag of esoteric approaches you can take.

For example, there's a professional athlete revenue share,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3679" target="_blank">01:01:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">where let's say somebody just signed a minor league contract and they don't have any money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right now. They're making very little on that, but they're likely to become the next major leaguer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3693" target="_blank">01:01:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and sign a very big contract. But it's going to be quite a while out because they're going to be in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3697" target="_blank">01:01:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the minors for three years or five years. And then the way contracts are structured in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">major leagues is your rookie contract lasts another five years and it's not worth that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So they could be 10 years out from their high earning potential. You could say, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to give you $100,000. And in return, I want 2% of your salary should you make the majors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't make the majors, I've lost my money. You got $100,000. That's the risk for me. But if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you do make it and I get 2% claim on it, if you sign $100 million contract, now I'm getting a $2</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">million payout there." So that's just an example of, again, how almost anything can be an alternative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">asset. And where do things, art, farmland, those fall in one of these buckets also?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, to this point of almost anything you say, "Is that an alternative?" And the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3744" target="_blank">01:02:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be yes. I think something like farmland, that probably falls into your overall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3749" target="_blank">01:02:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">world of real estate.

I think that's probably a low risk, low return version of real estate. It's a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3758" target="_blank">01:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">predictable yield.

And it's probably just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3763" target="_blank">01:02:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to slowly appreciate. The jackpot for farmland real estate is if you happen to be in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the path of urban sprawl.

You've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3786" target="_blank">01:03:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">these things, as you're saying, like art, like watches, and probably crypto is like this as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3791" target="_blank">01:03:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">where there's not really an obvious measure of what's the intrinsic value here.

It's really only worth what somebody will pay for it. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">no cash flow stream there.

So my kids are a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=4906" target="_blank">01:21:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit older.

Why did we get a Hyundai?" And he goes, "That we didn't have the money for." I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=4928" target="_blank">01:22:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">"We could if we wanted to buy a fancier car.

Each kid, as soon as they were born,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5051" target="_blank">01:24:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I opened a brokerage account for them. So this was separate from their 529 college savings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5055" target="_blank">01:24:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but just a brokerage account to buy individual shares of stock. And then for every birthday and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5060" target="_blank">01:24:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Christmas and Hanukkah, they each get to pick out one stock that they're interested in.

Or how about Disney?" Or something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5068" target="_blank">01:24:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And I just print out a cute, goofy looking stock certificate. And they think that's semi</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5072" target="_blank">01:24:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">cool. But then especially my son, now he's 11, has gotten older, he's expressed interest in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5077" target="_blank">01:24:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we will actually talk about particular companies and say, "Hey, your birthday is coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5081" target="_blank">01:24:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">up.

And the cool thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5103" target="_blank">01:25:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about kids is if he's getting 75 cents in dividends from some companies that, "Wow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5106" target="_blank">01:25:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I just got 75 cents I didn't work for." For a grownup, you might say, "Hey, who cares about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5110" target="_blank">01:25:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">75 cents?"

And just at least for him, I saw this light bulb go out of these dividends,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5137" target="_blank">01:25:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, I didn't do anything.

You know every parent, discipline is such a challenge. You lecture them, you give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5175" target="_blank">01:26:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">them consequences, timeouts, takes things away, et cetera. But for a certain class of misbehavior,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5181" target="_blank">01:26:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this can actually be really effective. So my son and I were at Boy Scouts a couple of weeks ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5187" target="_blank">01:26:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He was throwing around his Boy Scout book and he accidentally threw it up in the rafters and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5190" target="_blank">01:26:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it got stuck there. And so I was being so frustrated with him like, "Why'd you do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5195" target="_blank">01:26:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to cost $25 to buy a new Boy Scout book." And I realized, "You know what, Jack?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5198" target="_blank">01:26:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You got to spend the $25 to buy that Boy Scout book.

It factually cost $25. We can look on Amazon here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5208" target="_blank">01:26:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and saying getting a new book is costing $25. That's coming out of your account there."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5212" target="_blank">01:26:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was, I would say, it was a very fair consequence. It was just a natural consequence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5218" target="_blank">01:26:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of what he did, but it really reinforced it. He has not done that same thing again when he realized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5222" target="_blank">01:27:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, I have to pay out of pocket for this."

But you get these small classes of things where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5231" target="_blank">01:27:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">can actually just make them more responsible, at least with material things, by making them live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5236" target="_blank">01:27:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with the consequences when they act irresponsibly.

I looked at this a lot when they were born, and I've just started to put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5262" target="_blank">01:27:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">on autopilot since then. The math I did when they were born was basically if you put $1,000 a month</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5268" target="_blank">01:27:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">from day one into a 529 plan, assuming some reasonable rate of return, that's going to more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5275" target="_blank">01:27:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or less cover the cost of college when they get there. Since that was seven, 11 years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5280" target="_blank">01:28:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's probably a higher number today. Maybe it's 1,200 bucks that you need to put a month into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5283" target="_blank">01:28:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that. But I just started that from day one, and those accounts have been building up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5287" target="_blank">01:28:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the upside to 529s, they're great from a tax perspective. You put the money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5294" target="_blank">01:28:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in untaxed at the beginning, but basically it grows untaxed. The dividends are untaxed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5298" target="_blank">01:28:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">capital gains are untaxed. And when you take it out, as long as you're spending it on education,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5302" target="_blank">01:28:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's a very broad set of things that cause education, there's no taxes ever when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5307" target="_blank">01:28:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">taking it out. So it's great there. The only "risk" is that you actually overfund it, and maybe your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5312" target="_blank">01:28:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">kid doesn't go to college, or they get a full scholarship, or they go to an inexpensive in-state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5316" target="_blank">01:28:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">school, and you've got too much money in there. I think it's a really pretty small problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5320" target="_blank">01:28:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">One reason is that you can take that money out and just pay a penalty. But if it's been compounding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5324" target="_blank">01:28:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for 20 years, you've probably done better than the penalty anyway. Or if you're fortunate that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5329" target="_blank">01:28:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got extra money, and there's money left over in there, you can always just repurpose that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5333" target="_blank">01:28:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to a new beneficiary. So in theory, you could make your grandkids the beneficiary of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5337" target="_blank">01:28:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you've done your kids' college savings on their behalf for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iok4j3K0HOs&t=5341" target="_blank">01:29:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I have probably overfunded what we need to have in there.
