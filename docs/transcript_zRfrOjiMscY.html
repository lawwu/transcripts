Bless Yahweh, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless Yahweh, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits, who pardons all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with loving kindness and compassion, who satisfies your years with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle.</p><p>Yahweh performs righteous deeds and judgments for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the sons of Israel. Yahweh is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in loving kindness. He will not always contend with us, and he will not keep his anger forever.</p><p>He has not dealt with us according to our sins, and he has not rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</p><p>As a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him. For he himself knows our form; he remembers that we are but dust. As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flowers. When the wind has passed over it, it is no more, and its place acknowledges it no longer.</p><p>Yet the loving kindness of Yahweh is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, in his righteousness to children's children, to those who keep his covenant and remember his precepts to do them. Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all. Bless Yahweh, you his angels, mighty in strength, who perform his word, obeying the voice of his word.</p><p>Bless Yahweh, all you his hosts, you who serve him, doing his will. Bless Yahweh, all you works of his, and all places of his rule. Bless Yahweh, O my soul. This is God's holy word. Amen. Amen. Amen.</p></div></div></body></html>
