class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=5">00:00:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you come across this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=7">00:00:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So Robert Nozick had this thought experiment where you imagine some crazy, super-duper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=14">00:00:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">neuroscientist of the future have created a machine that could give you any experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=18">00:00:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you want if you step in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=21">00:00:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And for the rest of your life, you can kind of pre-programmed it in different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=27">00:00:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So your fondest dreams could come true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=32">00:00:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You could, whatever you dream, you want to be a great artist, a great lover, like have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=37">00:00:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a wonderful life, all of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=40">00:00:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">If you step into the experience machine, will be your experiences constantly happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=47">00:00:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But you would kind of disconnect from the rest of reality and you would float there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=50">00:00:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in a tank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=53">00:00:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Nozick thought that most people would choose not to enter the experience machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=60">00:01:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, many might want to go there for a holiday, but they wouldn't want to sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=63">00:01:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">check out of existence permanently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=66">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he thought that was an argument against certain views of value, according to what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=72">00:01:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we value is a function of what we experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=76">00:01:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because in the experience machine, you could have any experience you want, and yet many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=80">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">people would think that would not be much value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=83">00:01:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So therefore, what we value depends on other things than what we experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=90">00:01:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So okay, can you take that argument further?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=93">00:01:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What about the fact that maybe what we value is the up and down of life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=96">00:01:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You could have up and downs in the experience machine, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=100">00:01:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But what can't you have in the experience machine?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=102">00:01:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, that then becomes an interesting question to explore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=106">00:01:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But for example, real connection with other people, if the experience machine is a solo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=111">00:01:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">machine where it's only you, that's something you wouldn't have there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=116">00:01:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You would have this subjective experience that would be like fake people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=120">00:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you gave somebody flowers, that wouldn't be anybody there who actually got happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=125">00:02:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It would just be a little simulation of somebody smiling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=129">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But the simulation would not be the kind of simulation I'm talking about in the simulation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=132">00:02:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">argument where the simulated creature is conscious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=135">00:02:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It would just be a kind of smiley face that would look perfectly real to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=140">00:02:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're now drawing a distinction between appear to be perfectly real and actually being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=146">00:02:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=147">00:02:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=148">00:02:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So that could be one thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=149">00:02:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, like a big impact on history, maybe it's also something you won't have if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=154">00:02:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">check into this experience machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=157">00:02:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So some people might actually feel the life I want to have for me is one where I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=161">00:02:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a big positive impact on how history unfolds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=167">00:02:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could kind of explore these different possible explanations for why it is you wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=175">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">want to go into the experience machine if that's what you feel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=179">00:02:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And one interesting observation regarding this Nozick thought experiment and the conclusions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=184">00:03:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">he wanted to draw from it is how much is a kind of a status quo effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=190">00:03:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of people might not want to get this on current reality to plug into this dream</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=196">00:03:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=197">00:03:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But if they instead were told, well, what you've experienced up to this point was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=204">00:03:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">dream now, do you want to disconnect from this and enter the real world when you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=212">00:03:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">no idea maybe what the real world is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=214">00:03:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe you could say, well, you're actually a farmer in Peru, growing peanuts and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=221">00:03:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">could live for the rest of your life in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=225">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Or would you want to continue your dream life as Alex Friedman, going around the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=232">00:03:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">making podcasts and doing research?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=235">00:03:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the status quo was that they were actually in the experience machine, I think a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=242">00:04:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people might then prefer to live the life that they are familiar with rather than sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=246">00:04:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of bail out into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=248">00:04:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So essentially the change itself, the leap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=251">00:04:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=252">00:04:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it might not be so much the reality itself that we are after, but it's more that we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=256">00:04:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe involved in certain projects and relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=260">00:04:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have a self-identity and these things that our values are kind of connected with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=265">00:04:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">carrying that forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=267">00:04:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then whether it's inside a tank or outside a tank in Peru, or whether inside a computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=274">00:04:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">or outside a computer, that's kind of less important to what we ultimately care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=280">00:04:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=281">00:04:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But still, just to linger on it, it is interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=286">00:04:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I find maybe people are different, but I find myself quite willing to take the leap to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=291">00:04:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">farmer in Peru, especially as the virtual reality system become more realistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=298">00:04:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I find that possibility, and I think more people would take that leap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=302">00:05:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But in this thought experiment, just to make sure we are on the same, so in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=305">00:05:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the farmer in Peru would not be a virtual reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=309">00:05:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be the real, your life, like before this whole experience machine started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=315">00:05:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I kind of assumed from that description, you're being very specific, but that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=321">00:05:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of idea just like washes away the concept of what's real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=326">00:05:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm still a little hesitant about your kind of distinction between real and illusion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=334">00:05:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">because when you can have an illusion that feels, I mean, that looks real, I don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=342">00:05:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">how you can definitively say something is real or not, what's a good way to prove that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=346">00:05:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">something is real in that context?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=349">00:05:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so I guess in this case, it's more a stipulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=352">00:05:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">In one case, you're floating in a

real world that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6he5RNXY0&t=379">00:06:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">could choose to
