href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">answer interface and what are the main components of RAG I won't go into like the super technical details but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you know you need an LLM to do the final synthesis you need an embedding model you need a vector database or you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">need some database could be you know a document store it could be a graph store it could be like a sequel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">database or a vector database and then here's the thing that's interesting is that you basically need a new data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">processing stack to handle the data parsing and injection side this is different than traditional ETL which is primarily for kind of like you know analytics workloads as well as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of like technologies that popped up around that here you know you're really you know at a very basic level say taking in a PDF slicing it up into a bunch of chunks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">figuring out how to do that well and index it and represent it in a bunch of different storage forms so that LLMs can have easy access to it right and a lot of what LLM index</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is trying to solve is on that data processing piece so at a very you know a big pain point that we see for a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">companies building LLM applications is going from prototype to production unlike traditional ML it's actually really easy to build a prototype</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">with like some of the tools that LLM index offers it takes like 10 minutes to build a rag pipeline that kind of works over your data but going from kind of works to something that's production quality is a lot harder and so as we see you scale up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the number of documents as we as the documents get more complex as you try to add more data sources you have a higher quality bar that you need to meet and then some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">general you know pain points that we see include accuracy issues knowing how to tune like a bunch of different knobs and then also scaling to a lot of data sources</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">oftentimes this either takes a lot of developer time or they just don't know how to do it and so what ends up happening is that POC you're building for the higher ups just ends up not like really working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">um and so therefore like the value of that overall project is diminished</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">um the other problem that we see is that generally speaking um most of these a lot of these larger companies that we talked to have a lot of data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">um and there's this like general issue of just like data silos right um you have unstructured data structured data semi-structured data apis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and somehow you know uh like this is um a similar problem occurs during the LLM application development where you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow bring in all this data into some central place so that your LLMs can understand it right and when they're able to understand it and ideally you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow if you had this magic tool that made that happen and made it work well then you're able to have this kind of like holy grail of RAG</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">uh just being able to synthesize answers um and do stuff over like any of your knowledge um anywhere in the enterprise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">um a thing that we talk about a lot uh both during the keynote yesterday as well as more generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is the importance of data processing and data quality um like you know we've probably all heard the term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like garbage in garbage out and this is true in machine learning but this is uh also true in uh LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">application development if you don't have good data quality and I can go into an example of what that means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">um you're not going to get back uh well represented information um so that even if your LLM is very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">uh oftentimes if your data quality is bad this leads to hallucinations within your application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and so we believe in developers like if you're kind of you know um leading AI at one of these like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprises uh you do want to make a bet on developers and and like you know I think generally speaking and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I tell I say this like pretty often um you should generally bet on probably building a little bit more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">than more than just like buying pure out-of-the-box solutions and there's a few reasons why this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">case first the AI space is moving really quickly the underlying technology is shifting developers are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the best position to translate that technology into enterprise value that are custom to your use case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if you you know go through the procurement process and purchase generally speaking like out-of-the-box tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that will solve maybe like the current pain point that you have around that um or like right and and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">provide a solution for that but it will probably be a lot slower to basically adapt it as new techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">pop up uh new workflows are possible and so we care a lot about developers and we want to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">provide the tooling and infrastructure to enable developers to build LLM applications over their data</span></div><div class="c"><span

how to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">make this thing

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the the um the overall answer to that is i think the default way most people are building these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation flows is you have some like say rag pipeline as like a tool right um and then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">basically have an agent as an outer layer um that reasons over the conversation history and can um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">basically you know synthesize the the right answer at the given point in time so the the knobs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">basically that you want to tune are the the agent reasoning like prompt um as well as the memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and i think the memory is actually pretty important because um right now most memory modules are like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">very primitive um there's not a lot of good things beyond just like dumping the conversation history</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">into the prompt um so happy to chat more about that as well but i think there's like a lot of a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of stuff there that you could probably try um just want to double check the time yeah okay okay okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">nurse yeah how are you using llama agents internally what's the most complex task that's a great question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">um so for those of you who weren't at the keynote we launched this thing called llama agents which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">an open source multi-agent um framework basically for helping you basically deploy agents as micro</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">services right now agents primarily live in like notebooks and the idea is to spin them up as like api</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">services right now i think we're mostly just like uh using it to build like kind of more constrained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">simple rag pipelines and it's actually still in alpha state so i encourage all of you to basically try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it out um there's a lot of things that i already know it can't do um for instance have like more general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">um kind of like uh there's like communication protocols and interfaces that we want to build in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a more interesting message queue system but you know if you have an enterprise use case that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like going agentic and you want to basically kind of understand it as microservices uh so they can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsUHnwSvTY&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">basically reuse encapsulate it um please track it out come talk to us
