We're a rare breed up here. - We are a rare breed. - I did an internship right out of school with the NBA league office. Our group was in charge of the rookie transition program. - Did you hear what happened to me at the rookie transition camp in New York?</p><p>- Was this the one where you posted Adam Silver's number? - I thought I was gonna get kicked out the league. - This comparison comes through and it's player A and player B. Player B's numbers were better in really every category. I was like, I'm gonna guess that player B is Nikola.</p><p>And they're like, yep, you're right. And I'm like, all right, well then who are we talking about with player A? Is this some sort of comparison with Nurk or is this some sort of comparison with someone else in the league? And they're like, player A is Larry Bird. And I was like, oh.</p><p>All of us kind of looked at each other like, because you know, sometimes when you talk to like a basketball purist even, Nikola's, his skill set and the way that he plays, you know, the eye test, he doesn't jump out at you right away. - There's a lot of talk about his number, number 15, and you know, him and Carmelo Anthony.</p><p>You know, it's not anything that really ever crossed our mind.</p></div></div></body></html>
