href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=94">00:01:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I've raised 10 SPACs, six in technology and four in biotechnology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=99">00:01:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've done six deals, two in tech and two in biotech.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=109">00:01:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reason to shut it down is pretty straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=112">00:01:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like when we launched these things, the stock market was in a much different place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=117">00:01:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">than it is today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=118">00:01:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so over the last two years, looking at deals, it's gotten harder and harder to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=125">00:02:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a good risk reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=126">00:02:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Now why is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=127">00:02:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the thing with the SPAC is you do a deal today, but it doesn't usually close for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=132">00:02:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">six or seven months in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=135">00:02:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have to do a deal where you have a really good sense that in six or seven months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=140">00:02:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">when the deal comes to close, that the price will be the same or even higher than what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=147">00:02:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it is today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=148">00:02:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it isn't, all of the investors that you've brought along in the SPAC have a right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=155">00:02:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to redeem, which is to say they file a notice that says, "You can complete the deal, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=159">00:02:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I want my money back."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=161">00:02:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And what they get back is the initial $10 that they used to buy the stock in the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=165">00:02:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=166">00:02:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when we started the SPAC, we sold stock at $10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=170">00:02:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so from my perspective, I was looking at this and I'm like, "This is a super volatile,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=175">00:02:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">ugly point in the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=177">00:02:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This last year has been really problematic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=178">00:02:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I kind of said this last November, and Nick, we can play the clip after and we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=184">00:03:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">come back to it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=185">00:03:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, my decision was that at this point to do a deal would probably put a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=191">00:03:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of capital at risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=194">00:03:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And in all of these deals, I'm typically investing $100 million at least in each of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=199">00:03:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I couldn't justify that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=201">00:03:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I couldn't see a good risk reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=202">00:03:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought the right thing to do, the responsible thing to do was just to wind these things down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=207">00:03:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's what we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=208">00:03:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not going to lose, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 million bucks for having set these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=210">00:03:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">things up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=212">00:03:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But we give everybody their money back, that $10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=214">00:03:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's actually better over the next five or six months than what it'll otherwise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=219">00:03:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">do if you're invested in the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=220">00:03:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that's a belief that I have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=223">00:03:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But hopefully when people get the $10 back in the next few weeks, if they want, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=226">00:03:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">can go and put that money back in the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=229">00:03:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully they'll do well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=230">00:03:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know, from my perspective, the risk reward was not good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=233">00:03:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Is part of the issue the inventory

of the things I heard speculated on CNBC, it's hard to convince a private company</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=244">00:04:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when I when I was talking to all of the CEOs of the Silicon Valley

misunderstanding about what specs were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=253">00:04:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we were able to dispel that because we had some really successful transactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=258">00:04:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there was a lot of interest in being a part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=261">00:04:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">In this phase, we were suffering from two very important things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=265">00:04:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">One was that valuations were just completely unvaluable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=267">00:04:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was completely up in the air.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=268">00:04:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">People had a huge question mark on late stage valuations, because we would come in, we

US VC has raised 139 billion in all of 2021. So if you put those two numbers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1266">00:21:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">together, yeah, you're looking at $260 billion in the last 18 months. And this is all record</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1273">00:21:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers being put up on the board.

And then, you know, may even be some time after that, when the VC firm feels like they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1296">00:21:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">want to make the announcement, you can't announce a fund until the process completely over, you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1300">00:21:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">subject to all sorts of additional SEC rules. So, you know, these funds might be announced in 20,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1307">00:21:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">22, but they may have actually been raised in 2021. So that I think is a really important point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1314">00:21:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Moreover, a lot of the funds may have already deployed capital before the crash. So there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1318">00:21:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that, I think, remarkable story that we talked about months ago in TechCrunch on how the latest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1325">00:22:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Tiger Fund, which wasn't even announced till March or April of 2022, but it had already been two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1331">00:22:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">thirds deployed by the time they even announced it. And so that was pretty stunning. So I, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1337">00:22:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">think that we don't really have a great sense of how much of this so-called dry powder has already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1344">00:22:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">been deployed, how much of it was really raised before the crash. It is true that LP relationships</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1349">00:22:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">with VC firms that have done well are sticky and good LPs stick with their partners during a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1356">00:22:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">downturn. So look, I mean, the VC world's not going out of business or anything like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1360">00:22:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but I would tend to think that this is an overly optimistic, overly rosy scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1366">00:22:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Do VCs have new funds that they're going to be ready to deploy in great companies?

Therefore, PitchBook can never have that data. So there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1400">00:23:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">lag and people were deploying at a very high velocity. Therefore, this number could be off 35%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1408">00:23:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, if people were deploying at a pace where they thought they were going to go back for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1411">00:23:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">new fund every year, which is what it was looking like in 2020, 2021, that six month period might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1417">00:23:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mean you've deployed half the fund. But look, if you just go back to a two and a half or three year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1425">00:23:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">pace of deployment, and before in 2021, we're at a one year pace of deployment, divide the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1432">00:23:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">availability of capital by two thirds.

That's a significant reduction. So yeah, I think founders should just be aware that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1444">00:24:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the market's going to be a lot tighter. And I think given what we're seeing in the public markets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1448">00:24:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">this week, it doesn't look to me like it's going to get any better. It looks to me like we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1452">00:24:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">headed for, I mean, I call it a double dip recession. I think, because of the pandemic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1455">00:24:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a couple of months ago, that's exactly what it's looking like. In fact, the Fed basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1460">00:24:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">said as much the Fed said, that would be just marginally positive next quarter. So we'd bounce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1466">00:24:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">back to slightly positive growth on a real basis. But then, you know, expect it to go negative again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1473">00:24:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and you know, recession, once all these interest rates kick in. And by the way, I mean, kudos to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1479">00:24:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Chamath for basically calling that, you know, when the Fed just a couple months ago was saying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1483">00:24:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so called neutral would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1485">00:24:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">three to three and a half percent.

Now the Fed just in two months has revised to saying that neutral is 4.6%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1495">00:24:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or something like that.

And so I tend to think that, you know, through the course of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1582">00:26:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">year, and through 2023, and possibly even a little bit of 24, it's going to be a grind. Unemployment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=1591">00:26:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">will go back up.

He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=2238">00:37:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">must be bluffing.

Those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=2334">00:38:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">are just they were tactical nuke size atomic bombs.

He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=2346">00:39:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">thought he basically jumped the shark.

So this idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&t=2380">00:39:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that he wouldn't I mean, we've been willing to do that.
