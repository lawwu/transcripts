Had to take me a little break. Thank you, sir. All right, sir. You want to say something real quick? Hold up. I mean, I'm still right. What do you have to say about tonight? Well, listen, life is full of ups and downs.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? This don't got to go on the vlog. I just wanted to know what you're going to say. No, I don't got to go on the vlog. But I want it to go on the vlog. All right, so tell me some good shit. I got some good shit I need to say, man.</p><p>So far that I am, I am just a man. But it's been a up and down weekend. But that's like life. It's like too many people are focused on the light at the end of the tunnel instead of realizing that the tunnel itself is life. There's a wise man right here.</p><p>You're a fool on YouTube. I normally don't drink or get too lit, man. But we had a fun time this weekend, celebrating my boy Austin's birthday. Obviously, the concert last night. So I'm here at the spa getting a little recovery working. But this spa is dope, man. It's like you're in the middle of the rain forest.</p><p>I'm at the St. Regis out here in Puerto Rico. Checking out their spa. Got the hot tub right here. Relaxation room. Then you walk over here and you got the cold plunge, steam room. So I'm going to do all of it. Sitting here in the hot tub right now.</p><p>I got a good little protocol whenever I do go out or I drink a little bit. I like to get in the hot tub, sweat it all out. So if you got a steam room or a hot tub, that's what I recommend. And then from there you just got to hydrate.</p><p>So I like coconut water. It's my go-to thing to rehydrate. Some vitamin water. I like vitamin water too. But yeah, after a night of going out or something, I like to get in the hot tub, sweat it all out. And then the cold plunge is a bonus too because once you're done in the hot tub and you sweat for a little bit, hop it in that cold plunge, it'll get you back right quick.</p><p>I'm nervous, man. I'm about to hop in this cold plunge. I ain't been in the cold plunge since the end of the basketball season. So I know it's about to be brick in there. Woo-hoo-hoo! Feel good though. Yeah, I ain't gonna lie y'all. It's pretty brick in here. Just got done with a smooth little spa day.</p><p>Feel super relaxed, man. A great way to cap off the weekend. And yeah, now I'm about to hit the airport. So appreciate y'all watching these vlogs, man. This one was a dope. I highly recommend Puerto Rico. Y'all gotta stop by the St. Regis out here and check out the scenery.</p><p>So appreciate y'all tuning in, man. It carries Mike out.</p></div></div></body></html>
