you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=9825" target="_blank">02:43:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking a lot about like the

out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=9995" target="_blank">02:46:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">what a solution to a problem is

like how you get to know a system, I think, is by probing it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=10889" target="_blank">03:01:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and then augmenting the message that you're sending and then checking the response to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

thing that I've said before, but I think in the case of language models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=10911" target="_blank">03:01:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the time each interaction you have is actually quite high information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=10917" target="_blank">03:01:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very predictive of other interactions that you'll have with the

you talk with a model hundreds or thousands of times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=10926" target="_blank">03:02:06.300</a></span> |

aren't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=10938" target="_blank">03:02:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">or questions that are just

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=10996" target="_blank">03:03:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and this might actually get to some interesting issues with

a poem, I think that a lot of models, if you ask them for a poem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11004" target="_blank">03:03:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the poem is fine. Usually it kind of rhymes. If you say, "Give me a poem about the Sun,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11010" target="_blank">03:03:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll be a certain length, it'll rhyme, it'll be fairly benign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11018" target="_blank">03:03:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've wondered before, is it the case that what you're seeing is kind of like the average?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11023" target="_blank">03:03:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It turns out, if you think about people who have to talk to a lot of people and be very charismatic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11027" target="_blank">03:03:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the weird things is that I'm like, "Well, they're kind of incentivized to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11031" target="_blank">03:03:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">these extremely boring views." Because if you have really interesting views, you're divisive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11036" target="_blank">03:03:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people are not going to like you. So if you have very extreme policy positions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11042" target="_blank">03:04:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you're just going to be less popular as a politician, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11046" target="_blank">03:04:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it might be similar with creative work. If you produce creative work that is just trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11051" target="_blank">03:04:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to maximize the number of people that like it, you're probably not going to get as many people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11055" target="_blank">03:04:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">who just absolutely love it, because it's going to be a little bit, you know, you're like, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11060" target="_blank">03:04:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the out. Yes, this is decent." And so you can do this thing where I have various prompting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11067" target="_blank">03:04:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">things that I'll do to get Claude to… I'll do a lot of like, "This is your chance to be fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11073" target="_blank">03:04:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">creative. I want you to just think about this for a long time. And I want you to create a poem about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11079" target="_blank">03:04:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this topic that is really expressive of you, both in terms of how you think poetry should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11084" target="_blank">03:04:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">structured, etc." And you just give it this really long prompt. And his poems are just so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11090" target="_blank">03:04:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">better. They're really good. And I don't think I'm someone who is… I think it got me interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11096" target="_blank">03:04:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">poetry, which I think was interesting. I would read these poems and just be like, "I love the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11102" target="_blank">03:05:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">imagery. I love like…" And it's not trivial to get the models to produce work like that. But when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11108" target="_blank">03:05:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">they do, it's really good. So I think that's interesting that just encouraging creativity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11114" target="_blank">03:05:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and for them to move away from the kind of standard, immediate reaction that might just be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11120" target="_blank">03:05:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the aggregate of what most people think is fine can actually produce things that, at least to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11124" target="_blank">03:05:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">mind, are probably a little bit more divisive, but I like them. But I guess a poem is a nice, clean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11132" target="_blank">03:05:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">um, way to observe creativity. It's just like easy to detect vanilla versus non-vanilla.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11138" target="_blank">03:05:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11138" target="_blank">03:05:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. That's interesting. That's really interesting. So on that topic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11143" target="_blank">03:05:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">so the way to produce creativity or something special, you mentioned writing prompts. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11148" target="_blank">03:05:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I've heard you talk about, I mean, the science and the art of prompt engineering. Could you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11155" target="_blank">03:05:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">speak to, uh, what it takes to write great prompts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11159" target="_blank">03:05:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I really do think that philosophy has been weirdly helpful for me here more than in many other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11167" target="_blank">03:06:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">respects. So in philosophy, what you're trying to do is convey these very hard concepts. One of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11175" target="_blank">03:06:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">things you are taught is like, and I think it is because it is, I think it is an anti-bullshit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11181" target="_blank">03:06:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">device in philosophy. Philosophy is an area where you could have people bullshitting and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11186" target="_blank">03:06:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't want that. Um, and so it's like this like desire for like extreme clarity. So it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11193" target="_blank">03:06:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">anyone could just pick up your paper, read it and know exactly what you're talking about is why it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11197" target="_blank">03:06:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">can almost be kind of dry. Like all of the terms are defined. Every objection is kind of gone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11202" target="_blank">03:06:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">through methodically. Um, and it makes sense to me because I'm like, when you're in such an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11206" target="_blank">03:06:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">a priori domain, like you just, clarity is sort of a, uh, this way that you can, you know, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11214" target="_blank">03:06:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">prevent people from just kind of making stuff up. And I think that's sort of what you have to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11220" target="_blank">03:07:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">with language models. Like very often I actually find myself doing sort of mini versions of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11224" target="_blank">03:07:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">philosophy, you know? So I'm like, suppose that you give me a task, I have a task for the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11229" target="_blank">03:07:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and I want it to like pick out a certain kind of question or identify whether an answer has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11233" target="_blank">03:07:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">certain property. Like I'll actually sit and be like, let's just give this a name, this property.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11239" target="_blank">03:07:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So like, you know, suppose I'm trying to tell it like, oh, I want you to identify whether this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11243" target="_blank">03:07:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">response was rude or polite. I'm like, that's a whole philosophical question in and of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11248" target="_blank">03:07:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have to do as much like philosophy as I can in the moment to be like, here's what I mean by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11251" target="_blank">03:07:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">rudeness and here's what I mean by politeness. And then there's a like, there's another element</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11256" target="_blank">03:07:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a bit more, um, I guess, I don't know if this is scientific or empirical. I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11263" target="_blank">03:07:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">empirical. So like I take that description and then what I want to do is, is again, probe the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11269" target="_blank">03:07:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">model like many times. Like this is very, prompting is very iterative. Like I think a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11273" target="_blank">03:07:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">where they're, if a prompt is important, they'll iterate on it hundreds or thousands of times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11277" target="_blank">03:07:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you give it the instructions and then I'm like, what are the edge cases? So if I looked at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11283" target="_blank">03:08:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">this, so I try and like almost like, you know, see myself from the position of the model and be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11289" target="_blank">03:08:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the exact case that I would misunderstand or where I would just be like, I don't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11293" target="_blank">03:08:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to do in this case. And then I give that case to the model and I see how it responds. And if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11297" target="_blank">03:08:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">think I got it wrong, I add more instructions or even add that in as an example. So these very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11302" target="_blank">03:08:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">like taking the examples that are right at the edge of what you want and don't want and putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11306" target="_blank">03:08:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">those into your prompt as like an additional kind of way of describing the thing. Um, and so yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11312" target="_blank">03:08:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">in many ways it just feels like this mix of like, it's really just trying to do clear exposition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11317" target="_blank">03:08:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I think I do that cause that's how I get clear on things myself. So in many ways, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11323" target="_blank">03:08:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">clear prompting for me is often just me understanding what I want. Um, it's like half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11327" target="_blank">03:08:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the task. So I guess that's quite challenging. There's like a laziness that overtakes me if I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11333" target="_blank">03:08:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to Claude where I hope Claude just figures it out. So for example, I asked Claude for today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11339" target="_blank">03:08:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask some interesting questions. Okay. And the questions that came up, and I think I listed a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11345" target="_blank">03:09:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, um, interesting counterintuitive and or funny or something like this. All right. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11351" target="_blank">03:09:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">gave me some pretty good, like it was okay. But I think what I'm hearing you say is like, all right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11357" target="_blank">03:09:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I have to be more rigorous here. I should probably give examples of what I mean by interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11362" target="_blank">03:09:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and what I mean by funny or counterintuitive and iteratively, um, build that prompt to do better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11373" target="_blank">03:09:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to get it like what feels like is the right. Cause it's really, it's a creative act. I'm not asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11379" target="_blank">03:09:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">for factual information, I'm asking to together right with Claude. So I almost have to program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11385" target="_blank">03:09:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">using natural language. Yeah. I think that prompting does feel a lot like the kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11390" target="_blank">03:09:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the programming using natural language and experimentation or something. It's an odd blend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11395" target="_blank">03:09:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of the two. I do think that for most tasks. So if I just want Claude to do a thing, I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11400" target="_blank">03:10:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I am probably more used to knowing how to ask it to avoid like common pitfalls or issues that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11405" target="_blank">03:10:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it has. I think these are decreasing a lot over time. Um, but it's also very fine to just ask it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11411" target="_blank">03:10:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">for the thing that you want. Um, I think that prompting actually only really becomes relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11416" target="_blank">03:10:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're really trying to eke out the top, like 2% of model performance. So for like a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11420" target="_blank">03:10:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of tasks, I might just, you know, if it gives me an initial list back and there's something I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11424" target="_blank">03:10:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">like about it, like it's kind of generic, like for that kind of task, I'd probably just take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11428" target="_blank">03:10:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">a bunch of questions that I've had in the past that I've thought worked really well. And I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11432" target="_blank">03:10:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">just give it to the model and then be like, no, here's this person that I'm talking with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11436" target="_blank">03:10:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Give me questions of at least that quality. Um, or I might just ask it for some questions. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11443" target="_blank">03:10:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">if I was like, Oh, these are kind of try or like, you know, I would just give it that feedback and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11447" target="_blank">03:10:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">then hopefully produces a better list. Um, I think that kind of iterative prompting at that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11453" target="_blank">03:10:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">your prompt is like a tool that you're going to get so much value out of that you're willing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11456" target="_blank">03:10:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">put in the work. Like if I was a company making prompts for models, I'm just like, if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11461" target="_blank">03:11:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">willing to spend a lot of like time and resources on the engineering behind like what you're building,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11465" target="_blank">03:11:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">then the prompt is not something that you should be spending like an hour on. It's like, that's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11470" target="_blank">03:11:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">big part of your system. Make sure it's working really well. And so it's only things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11474" target="_blank">03:11:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if I, if I'm using a prompt to like classify things or to create data, that's when you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11479" target="_blank">03:11:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually worth just spending like a lot of time, like really thinking it through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11482" target="_blank">03:11:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">What other advice would you give to people that are talking to Claude sort of generally more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11489" target="_blank">03:11:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">general? Cause right now we're talking about maybe the edge cases, like eking out the 2%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11492" target="_blank">03:11:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">but what in general advice would you give when they show up to Claude trying it for the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11498" target="_blank">03:11:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">time? You know, there's a concern that people over-anthropomorphize models. And I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11501" target="_blank">03:11:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like a very valid concern. I also think that people often under-anthropomorphize them because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11506" target="_blank">03:11:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes when I see like issues that people have run into with Claude, you know, say Claude is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11511" target="_blank">03:11:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">like refusing a task that it shouldn't refuse. But then I look at the text and like the specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11516" target="_blank">03:11:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">wording of what they wrote. And I'm like, I see why Claude did that. And I'm like, if you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11523" target="_blank">03:12:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">through how that looks to Claude, you probably could have just written it in a way that wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11527" target="_blank">03:12:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">evoke such a response. Especially this is more relevant if you see failures or if you see issues,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11533" target="_blank">03:12:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it's sort of like, think about what the model failed at, like why, what did it do wrong?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11538" target="_blank">03:12:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then maybe that will give you a sense of like why. So is it the way that I phrased the thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11544" target="_blank">03:12:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously like as models get smarter, you're going to need less of this. And I already see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11549" target="_blank">03:12:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">like people needing less of it. But that's probably the advice is sort of like try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11554" target="_blank">03:12:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">have sort of empathy for the model. Like read what you wrote as if you were like a kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=11559" target="_blank">03:12:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">person just encountering this for the first time.

So they're having to draw this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=12990" target="_blank">03:36:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">line somewhere, and if they draw it too much in the direction of, "I'm imposing my ethical worldview</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=12998" target="_blank">03:36:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">on you, that seems bad." So in many ways, I like to think that we have actually seen improvements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13004" target="_blank">03:36:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">across the board, which is kind of interesting, because that kind of coincides with, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13012" target="_blank">03:36:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">adding more of character training.

It's one that respects you and your autonomy and your ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13027" target="_blank">03:37:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to choose what is good for you and what is right for you. Within limits, this is sometimes this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13032" target="_blank">03:37:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">concept of courageability to the user, so just being willing to do anything that the user asks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13037" target="_blank">03:37:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the models were willing to do that, then they would be easily misused. You're kind of just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13041" target="_blank">03:37:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">trusting. At that point, you're just seeing the ethics of the model, and what it does is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13046" target="_blank">03:37:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">completely the ethics of the user. And I think there's reasons to not want that, especially as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13052" target="_blank">03:37:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">models become more powerful, because you're like, "There might just be a small number of people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13055" target="_blank">03:37:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">want to use models for really harmful things." But having models, as they get smarter, figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13061" target="_blank">03:37:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">where that line is does seem important. And then, yeah, with the apologetic behavior, I don't like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13069" target="_blank">03:37:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that. I like it when Claude is a little bit more willing to push back against people or just not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13076" target="_blank">03:37:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">apologize. Part of me is like it often just feels kind of unnecessary. So I think those are things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13080" target="_blank">03:38:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that are hopefully decreasing over time. And yeah, I think that if people say things on the Internet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13089" target="_blank">03:38:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't mean that you should think that. That could be that there's actually an issue that 99%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13095" target="_blank">03:38:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of users are having that is totally not represented by that. But in a lot of ways, I'm just attending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13101" target="_blank">03:38:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to it and being like, "Is this right?

Is it something we're already trying to address?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13105" target="_blank">03:38:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">That feels good to me. Yeah. I wonder what Claude can get away with in terms of... I feel like it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13111" target="_blank">03:38:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">would just be easier to be a little bit more mean. But you can't afford to do that if you're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13118" target="_blank">03:38:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to a million people. I've met a lot of people in my life that sometimes, by the way, Scottish accent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13128" target="_blank">03:38:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">if they have an accent, they can say some rude shit and get away with it. And they're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13133" target="_blank">03:38:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">blunter. And there's some great engineers, even leaders that are just blunt and they get to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13139" target="_blank">03:38:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">point. And it's just a much more effective way of speaking somehow. But I guess when you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13145" target="_blank">03:39:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">super intelligent, you can't afford to do that. Can I have a blunt mode?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13153" target="_blank">03:39:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. That seems like a thing that I could definitely encourage the model to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13157" target="_blank">03:39:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's interesting because there's a lot of things in models that... It's funny where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13163" target="_blank">03:39:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there are some behaviors where you might not quite like the default. But then the thing I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13173" target="_blank">03:39:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">often say to people is, you don't realize how much you will hate it if I nudge it too much in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13177" target="_blank">03:39:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">other direction. So you get this a little bit with correction. The models accept correction from you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13182" target="_blank">03:39:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">probably a little bit too much right now. It'll push back if you say, "No, Paris isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13189" target="_blank">03:39:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the capital of France." But really, things that I think that the model is fairly confident in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13195" target="_blank">03:39:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you can still sometimes get it to retract by saying it's wrong. At the same time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13200" target="_blank">03:40:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">if you train models to not do that, and then you are correct about a thing, and you correct it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13205" target="_blank">03:40:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and it pushes back against you and is like, "No, you're wrong." It's hard to describe. That's so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13209" target="_blank">03:40:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">much more annoying. So it's a lot of little annoyances versus one big annoyance. It's easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13216" target="_blank">03:40:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to think that... We often compare it with the perfect. And then I'm like, "Remember, these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13220" target="_blank">03:40:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">models aren't perfect." And so if you nudge it in the other direction, you're changing the kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13224" target="_blank">03:40:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">errors it's going to make. And so think about which are the kinds of errors you like or don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13228" target="_blank">03:40:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like. So in cases like apologeticness, I don't want to nudge it too much in the direction of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13233" target="_blank">03:40:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">almost bluntness. Because I imagine when it makes errors, it's going to make errors in the direction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13238" target="_blank">03:40:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of being kind of rude. Whereas at least with apologeticness, you're like, "Oh, okay. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13244" target="_blank">03:40:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like it that much." But at the same time, it's not being mean to people. And actually, the time that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13249" target="_blank">03:40:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you undeservedly have a model be kind of mean to you, you probably like that a lot less than you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13253" target="_blank">03:40:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">mildly dislike the apology. So it's like one of those things where I'm like, "I do want it to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13259" target="_blank">03:40:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">better, but also while remaining aware of the fact that there's errors on the other side that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13263" target="_blank">03:41:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">possibly worse." I think that matters very much in the personality of the human. I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13268" target="_blank">03:41:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">a bunch of humans that just won't respect the model at all if it's super polite. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13275" target="_blank">03:41:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">some humans that'll get very hurt if the model's mean. I wonder if there's a way to adjust to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13281" target="_blank">03:41:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">personality, even locale. There's just different people. Nothing against New York, but New York is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13287" target="_blank">03:41:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">a little rough around the edges. They get to the point. And probably the same with Eastern Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13293" target="_blank">03:41:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you could just tell the model is my guess. For all of these things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13297" target="_blank">03:41:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, "The solution is always just try telling the model to do it." And sometimes it's just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13302" target="_blank">03:41:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just like, "Oh, at the beginning of the conversation, I just threw in like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13304" target="_blank">03:41:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know.

Or it'll be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13312" target="_blank">03:41:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">"I apologize. I can't be a New Yorker type of myself." But hopefully it wouldn't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13316" target="_blank">03:41:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">When you say character training, what's incorporated into character training?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13319" target="_blank">03:41:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that RLHF?

They can be shorter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13334" target="_blank">03:42:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">traits or they can be kind of richer descriptions.

So in that way, after the generation of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13352" target="_blank">03:42:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the queries, it's very much similar to constitutional AI.

Or I'll just misinterpret it and be like, "Oh yeah."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13404" target="_blank">03:43:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I have two thoughts that feel vaguely relevant, but let me know if they're not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13415" target="_blank">03:43:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the first one is people can underestimate the degree to which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13421" target="_blank">03:43:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">what models are doing when they interact. I think that we still just too much have this model of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13428" target="_blank">03:43:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">as computers. So people often say like, "Oh, well, what values should you put into the model?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13433" target="_blank">03:43:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm often like that doesn't make that much sense to me because I'm like, "Hey, as human beings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13439" target="_blank">03:43:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we're just uncertain over values.

And so maybe that's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13646" target="_blank">03:47:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">this degree of empiricism and practicality comes from that perhaps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13652" target="_blank">03:47:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">To take a tangent on that since it reminded me of a blog post you wrote on optimal rate of failure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13657" target="_blank">03:47:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=13659" target="_blank">03:47:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you explain the key idea there?

When a human is being mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=14507" target="_blank">04:01:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to an AI system, I think the obvious near-term negative effect is on the human, not on the AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=14515" target="_blank">04:01:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">system. And so we have to kind of try to construct an incentive system where you should behave the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=14523" target="_blank">04:02:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">same, just like as you were saying with prompt engineering, behave with Claude like you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=14528" target="_blank">04:02:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">with other humans.

It's calling out for us to go and answer it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15572" target="_blank">04:19:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">when we talk about neural networks. And I think it's also a very deep question for safety reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15576" target="_blank">04:19:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">>> So mechanistic interpretability, I guess, is closer to maybe neurobiology?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15581" target="_blank">04:19:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah, yeah, I think that's right.

What part of the image made it think that it's a dog? And that tells you maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15600" target="_blank">04:20:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">something about the model, if you can come up with a principled version of that. But it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15604" target="_blank">04:20:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">really tell you what algorithms are running in the model. How is the model actually making that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15608" target="_blank">04:20:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">decision? Maybe it's telling you something about what was important to it, if you can make that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15612" target="_blank">04:20:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">method work. But it isn't telling you what are the algorithms that are running? How is it that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15619" target="_blank">04:20:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">system is able to do this thing that no one knew how to do? And so I guess we started using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15623" target="_blank">04:20:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">term mechanistic interpretability to try to sort of draw that divide or to distinguish ourselves in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15629" target="_blank">04:20:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the work that we were doing in some ways from some of these other things. And I think since then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15632" target="_blank">04:20:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it's become this sort of umbrella term for a pretty wide variety of work. But I'd say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15638" target="_blank">04:20:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that are kind of distinctive are, I think, A, this focus on we really want to get at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15643" target="_blank">04:20:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the mechanisms, we want to get at the algorithms. If you think of neural networks as being like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15647" target="_blank">04:20:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">computer program, then the weights are kind of like a binary computer program. And we'd like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15653" target="_blank">04:20:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to reverse engineer those weights and figure out what algorithms are running. So, okay, I think one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15657" target="_blank">04:20:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">way you might think of trying to understand a neural network is that it's kind of like we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15660" target="_blank">04:21:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this compiled computer program and the weights of the neural network are the binary. And when the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15666" target="_blank">04:21:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">neural network runs, that's the activations. And our goal is ultimately to go and understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15672" target="_blank">04:21:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">these weights. And so the project of mechanistic interpretability is to somehow figure out how do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15677" target="_blank">04:21:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">these weights correspond to algorithms. And in order to do that, you also have to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15681" target="_blank">04:21:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the activations because the activations are like the memory. And if you imagine reverse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15686" target="_blank">04:21:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering a computer program and you have the binary instructions, in order to understand what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15692" target="_blank">04:21:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a particular instruction means, you need to know what is stored in the memory that it's operating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15697" target="_blank">04:21:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">on. And so those two things are very intertwined. So mechanistic interpretability tends to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15701" target="_blank">04:21:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in both of those things. Now, there's a lot of work that's interested in those things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15707" target="_blank">04:21:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">especially there's all this work on probing, which you might see as part of being mechanistic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15712" target="_blank">04:21:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">interpretability, although it's, again, it's just a broad term and not everyone who does that work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15715" target="_blank">04:21:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">would identify as doing mechanistic interpretability. I think the thing that is maybe a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15720" target="_blank">04:22:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">distinctive to the vibe of MechInterp is, I think people working in this space tend to think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15725" target="_blank">04:22:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">neural networks as, well, maybe one way to say it is the gradient descent is smarter than you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15730" target="_blank">04:22:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you know, gradient descent is actually really great. The whole reason that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15734" target="_blank">04:22:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding these models is because we didn't know how to write them in the first place. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15736" target="_blank">04:22:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">gradient descent comes up with better solutions than us. And so I think that maybe another thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15740" target="_blank">04:22:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">about MechInterp is sort of having almost a kind of humility that we won't guess a priori what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15745" target="_blank">04:22:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">going on inside the model. And so we have to have the sort of bottom up approach where we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15749" target="_blank">04:22:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">really assume, you know, we don't assume that we should look for a particular thing and that will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15752" target="_blank">04:22:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">be there and that's how it works. But instead, we look for the bottom up and discover what happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15756" target="_blank">04:22:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to exist in these models and study them that way. LR: But, you know, the very fact that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15761" target="_blank">04:22:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">possible to do, and as you and others have shown over time, you know, things like universality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15768" target="_blank">04:22:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that the wisdom of the gradient descent creates features and circuits, creates things universally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15777" target="_blank">04:22:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">across different kinds of networks that are useful. And that makes the whole field possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15782" target="_blank">04:23:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">CM: Yeah. So this is actually, is indeed a really remarkable and exciting thing where it does seem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15787" target="_blank">04:23:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">like, at least to some extent, you know, the same elements, the same features and circuits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15794" target="_blank">04:23:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">form again and again. You know, you can look at every vision model and you'll find curve detectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15798" target="_blank">04:23:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and you'll find high-low frequency detectors. And in fact, there's some reason to think that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15802" target="_blank">04:23:22.060</a></span> | <span class="t">same things form across, you know, biological neural networks and artificial neural networks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15807" target="_blank">04:23:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So a famous example is vision models in the early layers. They have Gabor filters and there's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15811" target="_blank">04:23:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, Gabor filters are something that neuroscientists are interested in and have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15814" target="_blank">04:23:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">thought a lot about. We find curve detectors in these models. Curve detectors are also found in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15818" target="_blank">04:23:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">monkeys. We discover these high-low frequency detectors and then some follow-up work went and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15823" target="_blank">04:23:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">discovered them in rats or mice. So they were found first in artificial neural networks and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15828" target="_blank">04:23:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">then found in biological neural networks. You know, there's this really famous result on, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15832" target="_blank">04:23:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">grandmother neurons or the Haley-Berry neuron from Quiroga et al. And we found very similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15837" target="_blank">04:23:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">things in vision models where, as well, I was still at OpenAI and I was looking at their CLIP</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15841" target="_blank">04:24:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">model. And you find these neurons that respond to the same entities in images. And also to give a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15848" target="_blank">04:24:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">concrete example there, we found that there was a Donald Trump neuron. For some reason, I guess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15851" target="_blank">04:24:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone likes to talk about Donald Trump and Donald Trump was very prominent. It was a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15856" target="_blank">04:24:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">hot topic at that time. So every neural network we looked at, we would find a dedicated neuron</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15860" target="_blank">04:24:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for Donald Trump. And that was the only person who had always had a dedicated neuron. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15865" target="_blank">04:24:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes you'd have an Obama neuron, sometimes you'd have a Clinton neuron, but Trump always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15869" target="_blank">04:24:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">had a dedicated neuron. So it responds to, you know, pictures of his face and the word Trump,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15875" target="_blank">04:24:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">like all these things, right? And so it's not responding to a particular example or, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15881" target="_blank">04:24:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not just responding to his face, it's abstracting over this general concept, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15885" target="_blank">04:24:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So in any case, that's very similar to these Quiroga et al results. So there's evidence that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15889" target="_blank">04:24:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">this phenomenon of universality, the same things form across both artificial and natural neural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=15895" target="_blank">04:24:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">networks.

You could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16117" target="_blank">04:28:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">try to be like, "Oh, you know, there's a dog-detecting neuron, and here's a car-detecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16121" target="_blank">04:28:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">neuron."

So you can go and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16125" target="_blank">04:28:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, you know, I have this car-detecting neuron.

So the problem is that not all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16163" target="_blank">04:29:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">neurons are interpretable.

So sometimes it's not that there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16180" target="_blank">04:29:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">single neuron that represents, say, a car, but it actually turns out after you detect the car,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16185" target="_blank">04:29:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the model sort of hides a little bit of the car in the following layer and a bunch of dog detectors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16190" target="_blank">04:29:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is it doing that?

So we need some term for these kind of neuron-like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16221" target="_blank">04:30:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">entities, these things that we sort of would have liked the neurons to be, these idealized neurons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16225" target="_blank">04:30:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that are the nice neurons, but also maybe there's more of them somehow hidden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16229" target="_blank">04:30:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and we call those features. And then what are circuits?

So when we have the car detector, and it's connected to a window detector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16240" target="_blank">04:30:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and a wheel detector, and it looks for the wheels below and the windows on top, that's a circuit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16245" target="_blank">04:30:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So circuits are just collections of features connected by weights, and they implement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16250" target="_blank">04:30:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithms. So they tell us, you know, how are features used? How are they built? How do they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16255" target="_blank">04:30:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">connect together? So maybe it's worth trying to pin down, like, what really is the core hypothesis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16261" target="_blank">04:31:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">here? And I think the core hypothesis is something we call the linear representation hypothesis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16266" target="_blank">04:31:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we think about the car detector, you know, the more it fires, the more we sort of think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16271" target="_blank">04:31:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that as meaning, oh, the model is more and more confident that a car is present.

Like you could imagine something where you have, you know, you have this car detector neuron,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16291" target="_blank">04:31:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and you think, ah, you know, if it fires, like, you know, between one and two, that means one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16296" target="_blank">04:31:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, but it means, like, totally different if it's between three and four. That would be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16300" target="_blank">04:31:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">nonlinear representation. And in principle, that, you know, models could do that. I think it's sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16304" target="_blank">04:31:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of inefficient for them to do. If you try to think about how you'd implement computation like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16308" target="_blank">04:31:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of an annoying thing to do.

And then that gives weights a very clean interpretation as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16332" target="_blank">04:32:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">these edges between these entities, these features, and that edge then has a meaner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16338" target="_blank">04:32:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's, in some ways, the core thing.

So this is in some sense, the core of the linear representation hypothesis. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16487" target="_blank">04:34:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">describe it just as a purely abstract thing about vector spaces, you can describe it as a statement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16492" target="_blank">04:34:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">about the activations of neurons.

It's really, I think, mostly about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16503" target="_blank">04:35:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">property of being able to add things together, that you can sort of independently modify,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16508" target="_blank">04:35:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">say, gender and royalty or, you know, cuisine type or country and the concept of food by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16517" target="_blank">04:35:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">adding them.

Like, like, you can write down neural networks, where you write weights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16533" target="_blank">04:35:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">such that they don't have linear representations, where the right way to understand them is not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16537" target="_blank">04:35:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is not in terms of linear representations. But I think every natural neural network I've seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16542" target="_blank">04:35:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">has this property. There's been one paper recently, that there's been some sort of pushing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16550" target="_blank">04:35:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">around the edge. So I think there's been some work recently studying multi-dimensional features,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16553" target="_blank">04:35:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">where rather than a single direction, it's more like a manifold of directions. This to me still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16559" target="_blank">04:35:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">seems like a linear representation. And then there's been some other papers suggesting that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16564" target="_blank">04:36:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe in very small models, you get nonlinear representations. I think that the jury's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16570" target="_blank">04:36:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">out on that.

And that's wild. It doesn't have to be that way. And yet, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=16581" target="_blank">04:36:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of evidence that certainly at least this is very, very widespread.

There are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17192" target="_blank">04:46:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">in fact, all these lovely results from compressed sensing, and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17196" target="_blank">04:46:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and things like this, that they basically tell you that if you have a vector space, and you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17202" target="_blank">04:46:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have almost orthogonal vectors, which is sort of probably the thing that you want here, right?

So, polysemanticity is this observed phenomenon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17281" target="_blank">04:48:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and superposition is a hypothesis that would explain it, along with some other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17285" target="_blank">04:48:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that makes McInturb more difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17288" target="_blank">04:48:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.

It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17335" target="_blank">04:48:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just a mathematical function.

And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17554" target="_blank">04:52:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">turns out supersession is really hard, and we're kind of screwed." But that's not what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17558" target="_blank">04:52:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, a very natural, simple technique just works. And so, then that's actually a very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17563" target="_blank">04:52:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">situation. I think this is a sort of hard research problem, and it's got a lot of research risk. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17569" target="_blank">04:52:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it might still very well fail. But I think that some very significant amount of research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17574" target="_blank">04:52:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">risk was sort of put behind us when that started to work. >> Can you describe what kind of features</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17580" target="_blank">04:53:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">can be extracted in this way? >> Well, so, it depends on the model that you're studying, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17585" target="_blank">04:53:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the larger the model, the more sophisticated they're going to be. And we'll probably talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17588" target="_blank">04:53:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">follow-up work in a minute. But in these one-layer models, so, some very common things, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17593" target="_blank">04:53:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">were languages, both programming languages and natural languages. There were a lot of features</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17598" target="_blank">04:53:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that were specific words in specific contexts. So, "the," and I think really the way to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17604" target="_blank">04:53:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">about this is that "the" is likely about to be followed by a noun. So, it's really, you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17608" target="_blank">04:53:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">think of this as "the" feature, but you could also think of this as producing a specific noun feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17611" target="_blank">04:53:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And there would be these features that would fire for "the" in the context of, say, a legal document</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17618" target="_blank">04:53:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">or a mathematical document or something like this. And so, maybe in the context of math,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17625" target="_blank">04:53:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you're like, "the" and then predict vector or matrix, all these mathematical words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17630" target="_blank">04:53:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">whereas in other contexts, you would predict other things. That was common.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17633" target="_blank">04:53:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">>> And basically, we need clever humans to assign labels to what we're seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17639" target="_blank">04:53:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yes. So, the only thing this is doing is it's sort of unfolding things for you. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17645" target="_blank">04:54:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">if everything was sort of folded over top of it, you know, serialization folded everything on top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17649" target="_blank">04:54:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of itself, and you can't really see it, this is unfolding it. But now you still have a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17654" target="_blank">04:54:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">complex thing to try to understand. So, then you have to do a bunch of work understanding what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17658" target="_blank">04:54:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">these are. And some of them are really subtle. Like, there's some really cool things, even in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17662" target="_blank">04:54:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">this one-layer model about Unicode, where, you know, of course, some languages are in Unicode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17667" target="_blank">04:54:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and the tokenizer won't necessarily have a dedicated token for every Unicode character.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17673" target="_blank">04:54:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, instead, what you'll have is you'll have these patterns of alternating tokens that each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17678" target="_blank">04:54:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">represent half of a Unicode character. And you have a different feature that, you know, goes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17682" target="_blank">04:54:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">activates on the opposing ones to be like, okay, you know, I just finished a character, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17686" target="_blank">04:54:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">go and predict next prefix. Then, okay, I'm on the prefix, you know, predict a reasonable suffix,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17692" target="_blank">04:54:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have to alternate back and forth. So, there's, you know, these one-layer models are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17697" target="_blank">04:54:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">really interesting. And I mean, there's another thing, which is, you might think, okay, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17701" target="_blank">04:55:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">would just be one Base64 feature. But it turns out, there's actually a bunch of Base64 features,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17705" target="_blank">04:55:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">because you can have English text encoded as Base64, and that has a very different distribution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17711" target="_blank">04:55:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of Base64 tokens than regular. And there's some things about tokenization as well that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17717" target="_blank">04:55:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">it can exploit, and I don't know, there's all kinds of fun stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17721" target="_blank">04:55:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">How difficult is the task of sort of assigning labels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17724" target="_blank">04:55:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to what's going on?

I think that's a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17737" target="_blank">04:55:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">exciting direction. And we do a fair amount of automated interoperability and have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17741" target="_blank">04:55:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude go and label our features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17742" target="_blank">04:55:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there some funny moments where it's totally right or it's totally wrong?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17747" target="_blank">04:55:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, I think it's very common that it's like, says something very general,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17752" target="_blank">04:55:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like, true in some sense, but not really picking up on the specific of what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17758" target="_blank">04:55:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think that's a pretty common situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17762" target="_blank">04:56:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't know that I have a particularly amusing one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17766" target="_blank">04:56:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">That's interesting, that little gap between it is true,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17768" target="_blank">04:56:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">but it doesn't quite get to the deep nuance of a thing. That's a general challenge. It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17776" target="_blank">04:56:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it's already an incredible costume that can say a true thing, but it's missing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17782" target="_blank">04:56:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the depth sometimes. And in this context, it's like the arc challenge, the sort of IQ type of tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17789" target="_blank">04:56:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels like figuring out what a feature represents is a little puzzle you have to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17795" target="_blank">04:56:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

And there's another thing, which I don't know, maybe in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17805" target="_blank">04:56:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">some ways, this is my aesthetic coming in, but I'll try to give you a rationalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17809" target="_blank">04:56:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually a little suspicious of automated interoperability.

So, you have to do all this stuff of splitting it across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17964" target="_blank">04:59:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">large GPUs. Oh, yeah. I mean, there's a huge engineering challenge here too, right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17968" target="_blank">04:59:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah. So, there's a scientific question of how do you scale things effectively? And then there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17973" target="_blank">04:59:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">an enormous amount of engineering to go and scale this up. So, you have to chart it, you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17977" target="_blank">04:59:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">think very carefully about a lot of things. And I'm lucky to work with a bunch of great engineers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17981" target="_blank">04:59:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">because I am definitely not a great engineer. Yeah. And the infrastructure, especially. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17984" target="_blank">04:59:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for sure. So, it turns out, TODR, it worked. It worked. Yeah. And I think this is important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17990" target="_blank">04:59:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">because you could have imagined a world where you set after towards monosemanticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17995" target="_blank">04:59:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Chris, this is great. It works on a one-layer model. But one-layer models are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=17999" target="_blank">04:59:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">really idiosyncratic. Maybe the linear representation hypothesis and superposition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18005" target="_blank">05:00:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">hypothesis is the right way to understand a one-layer model, but it's not the right way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18009" target="_blank">05:00:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand larger models. And so, I think, I mean, first of all, the Cunningham et al paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18014" target="_blank">05:00:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">cut through that a little bit and suggested that this wasn't the case. But scaling monosemanticity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18021" target="_blank">05:00:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, was significant evidence that even for very large models, and we did it on Claude III</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18025" target="_blank">05:00:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Sonnet, which at that point was one of our production models, you know, even these models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18030" target="_blank">05:00:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">seem to be very, you know, seem to be substantially explained, at least, by linear features and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18037" target="_blank">05:00:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, doing dictionary learning on the works. And as you learn more features, you go and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18040" target="_blank">05:00:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">explain more and more. So, that's, I think, quite a promising sign. And you find now really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18047" target="_blank">05:00:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">fascinating abstract features. And the features are also multimodal. They respond to images and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18052" target="_blank">05:00:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">text for the same concept, which is fun. - Yeah. Can you explain that? I mean, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18057" target="_blank">05:00:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, backdoor, there's just a lot of examples that you can...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18060" target="_blank">05:01:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah. So, maybe let's start with one example to start, which is we found some features around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18065" target="_blank">05:01:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, security vulnerabilities and backdoors in code. So, it turns out those are actually two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18068" target="_blank">05:01:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">different features. So, there's a security vulnerability feature. And if you force it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18073" target="_blank">05:01:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">active, Claude will start to go and write security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows into code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18079" target="_blank">05:01:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, it fires for all kinds of things. Like, you know, some of the top dataset examples for it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18083" target="_blank">05:01:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">were things like, you know, dash, dash, disable, you know, SSL or something like this, which are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18089" target="_blank">05:01:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of obviously really insecure. - So, at this point, it's kind of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18095" target="_blank">05:01:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe it's just because the examples are presented that way, it's kind of like surface, a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18100" target="_blank">05:01:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">more obvious examples, right? I guess the idea is that down the line, it might be able to detect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18107" target="_blank">05:01:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">more nuanced, like deception or bugs or that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18110" target="_blank">05:01:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah. Well, maybe I want to distinguish two things. So, one is the complexity of the feature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18116" target="_blank">05:01:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">or the concept, right? And the other is the nuance of how subtle the examples we're looking at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18124" target="_blank">05:02:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, when we show the top dataset examples, those are the most extreme examples that cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18129" target="_blank">05:02:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that feature to activate. And so, it doesn't mean that it doesn't fire for more subtle things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18135" target="_blank">05:02:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the insecure code feature, you know, the stuff that it fires for most strongly for are these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18141" target="_blank">05:02:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like, really obvious, you know, disable the security type things. But, you know, it also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18149" target="_blank">05:02:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">fires for, you know, buffer overflows and more subtle security vulnerabilities in code. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18155" target="_blank">05:02:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">these features are all multimodal. So, you could ask, like, what images activate this feature?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18159" target="_blank">05:02:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out that the security vulnerability feature activates for images of, like, people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18167" target="_blank">05:02:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">clicking on Chrome to, like, go past the, like, you know, this website, the SSL certificate might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18173" target="_blank">05:02:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">be wrong or something like this. Another thing that's very entertaining is there's backdoors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18176" target="_blank">05:02:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in code feature. Like, you activate it, it goes on, Cloud writes a backdoor that, like, will go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18180" target="_blank">05:03:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and dump your data to port or something. But you can ask, okay, what images activate the backdoor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18185" target="_blank">05:03:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">feature? It was devices with hidden cameras in them. So, there's a whole, apparently, genre of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18191" target="_blank">05:03:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">people going and selling devices that look innocuous, that have hidden cameras, and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18194" target="_blank">05:03:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">have ads about how there's a hidden camera in it. And I guess that is the, you know, physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18199" target="_blank">05:03:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">version of a backdoor. And so, it sort of shows you how abstract these concepts are, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18203" target="_blank">05:03:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just thought that was, I'm sort of sad that there's a whole market of people selling devices</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18209" target="_blank">05:03:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. But I was kind of delighted that that was the thing that it came up with as the top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18214" target="_blank">05:03:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">image examples for the feature. - Yeah, it's nice. It's multimodal. It's multi-almost context. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18219" target="_blank">05:03:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">broad, strong definition of a singular concept. It's nice. - Yeah. - To me, one of the really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18225" target="_blank">05:03:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting features, especially for AI safety, is deception and lying. And the possibility that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18232" target="_blank">05:03:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">these kinds of methods could detect lying in a model, especially gets smarter and smarter and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18237" target="_blank">05:03:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">smarter. Presumably, that's a big threat of a super intelligent model that it can deceive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18244" target="_blank">05:04:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the people operating it, as to its intentions or any of that kind of stuff. So, what have you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18250" target="_blank">05:04:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">learned from detecting lying inside models? - Yeah. So, I think we're, in some ways, in early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18256" target="_blank">05:04:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">days for that. We find quite a few features related to deception and lying. There's one feature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18263" target="_blank">05:04:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">where it fires for people lying and being deceptive, and you force it active, and Claude starts lying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18268" target="_blank">05:04:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to you. So, we have a deception feature. I mean, there's all kinds of other features about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18273" target="_blank">05:04:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">withholding information and not answering questions. Features about power-seeking and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18277" target="_blank">05:04:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">coups and stuff like that. There's a lot of features that are kind of related to spooky</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18281" target="_blank">05:04:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">things. And if you force them active, Claude will behave in ways that are not the kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18288" target="_blank">05:04:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">behaviors you want. - What are possible next exciting directions to you in the space of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18295" target="_blank">05:04:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Macintype? - Well, there's a lot of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18297" target="_blank">05:04:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for one thing, I would really like to get to a point where we have shortcuts, where we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18305" target="_blank">05:05:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">really understand not just the features, but then use that to understand the computation of models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18312" target="_blank">05:05:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That really, for me, is the ultimate goal of this. And there's been some work. We put out a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18319" target="_blank">05:05:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">things. There's a paper from Sam Marks that does some stuff like this. There's been some, I'd say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18323" target="_blank">05:05:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">some work around the edges here. But I think there's a lot more to do. And I think that will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18327" target="_blank">05:05:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a very exciting thing. That's related to a challenge we call interference weights, where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18335" target="_blank">05:05:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">due to superstition, if you just sort of naively look at whether features are connected together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18340" target="_blank">05:05:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">there may be some weights that sort of don't exist in the upstairs model, but are just sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18345" target="_blank">05:05:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of artifacts of superstition. So, that's a sort of technical challenge related to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18352" target="_blank">05:05:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think another exciting direction is just, you might think of sparse autoencoders as being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18358" target="_blank">05:05:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like a telescope.

And I think that's the thing that I care most about. But there's lots of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18440" target="_blank">05:07:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">other sort of larger scale questions you might care about. And somehow, the nice thing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18448" target="_blank">05:07:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">having a very microscopic approach is it's maybe easier to ask, is this true?

What do you think is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18611" target="_blank">05:10:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">difference between the human brain, the biological neural network, and the artificial neural network?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18617" target="_blank">05:10:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the neuroscientists have a much harder job than us.

You can force any, you can intervene</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4&t=18643" target="_blank">05:10:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">on any neuron and force it active and see what happens.
