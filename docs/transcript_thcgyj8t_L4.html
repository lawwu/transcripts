So for example, if you look at Jonah chapter 2 verse 1 the author uses the word 'meah' for belly and then in chapter 2 verse 2 he uses the word 'batan' for stomach, those are two synonyms in Hebrew and they mean the same thing essentially but they're different words, 'batan' and 'meah' are different words.</p><p>A lot of texts will just say Jonah was in the belly, Jonah was in the belly but the LSB says Jonah was in the stomach, Jonah was in the belly to show that the original author used two words, they mean the same thing but they're synonyms which highlights the artistry, the poetic nature, the ability of the original author to use different words and communicate God's word more effectively and the English reader through the LSB is able to see that.</p></div></div></body></html>
