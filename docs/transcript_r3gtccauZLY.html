You don't have that power. You don't think that some women are damaged? A man cannot permanently taint me. A lot of women are very ... they've had relationships that have completely changed their personalities, the way they trust a man, the way they view men in general.</p><p>I feel like you can be in a messed up relationship that can really mess you up. But I feel like when it comes to past and a man focusing on what happened five years ago or what man you slept with or what guy you were with, that is thinking, when this man stuck his penis in her, she no longer has value.</p><p>We're the whores, but who are we all? But the truth of the matter is, it's like, if you meet somebody that makes sense, whether they have a kid, whether they've been with someone publicly, why miss out on potential love of your life just because some guy dated her and it didn't work out?</p><p>That's probably the mature mindset.</p></div></div></body></html>
