I admit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I've never done one before. So it was, it was a new experience for me. When you host a president,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just a whole different level of preparation. The secret service was out like a week before the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">president has an amazing advanced team. They work out every detail. They make a map of your house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So they really have to think through everything. The police shut down the street.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really a very involved process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, I went to dinner in the city that night and you know, I was right by your house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I drove up the street and they had everything blocked off on like three blocks on both streets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like on both sides of your house. But there were all these protesters, like all throughout San</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Francisco, like pro Trump people had driven in from all over NorCal must've been, cause these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">were not supporters supporters. Yeah. And they came in with these like cars and the streets were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">blocked. It was a total zoo in the city for hours before and after your, I actually stayed in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">city that night and I heard the people going nuts for hours afterwards, but it definitely like took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">over. It took over the city. Yeah. So what's really interesting is that all week, the San Francisco</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">publications had been trying to gin up protesters by writing about that, you know, the president's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">coming to town and protesters are going to show up. And in fact, there was almost no anti-Trump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">protesters. And then a huge number of pro Trump demonstrators came out and they were waving flags</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and cheering along his motorcade as he was coming to the house. So the whole protest thing backfired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do you think anti-Trump protesters did not show up? What happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's just a big enthusiasm gap. I mean, I think that the pro Trump people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">very enthusiastic and the let's call pro Biden or anti-Trump people are just not very motivated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right now. So it's exhausting to be against Trump for eight years. Like this has been exhausting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">People are wiped out. I think they've exhausted folks. It's a losing proposition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, so Owen McCabe, who's the founder of Intercom, he was there. And I think this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a good summary because he said that he spoke with a bunch of people and none of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">them identifies Republican, all voted or donated Democrat in the past. That's true for me too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now they're backing this guy for his policies on war, immigration, crypto, and more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This election is referendum on those issues. So Owen came out, appreciate his support. But it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">true. The campaign told us that they had more first-time donors at this event than they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">seen before. And that's because a lot of these people hadn't supported Republicans or hadn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">supported Trump and they came out. So we have a few photos and videos here to take you behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the scenes. I think that might be interesting for people. So the first thing to say is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">President Trump is extremely charming. He connects with people in like five seconds. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">he meets you and find something interesting or funny to say. And he's hilarious. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">when he spoke in the living room and he talked extemporaneously for an hour, he's speaking off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the cuff. Every speech he gives is different. This is him coming into the living room. He had made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just a few notes about topics he wanted to talk about on a piece of paper, but that was it. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">was all completely extemporaneous. No teleprompter, obviously. And he's hilarious. I mean, people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">don't realize how entertaining he is. What were some of the greatest hits? What did he hit on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Did he hit on low pressure from showers? Did he? Because I know he's got like some things he hits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on that are relatable. Was it all like, specific crypto topics, tech topics? Or did he go?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, he did, you know, he did talk crypto. And it was really interesting. At one point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in his speech, he called on the Winklevoss brothers who were there. And I'm only mentioning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this because it was already reported that they were there. So I don't want to speak out of school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But he said to them, he says, I know you guys created Facebook. He was giving them credit for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">creating Facebook.

You were dealt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of cards, you know, a lot of cards. I mean, they're very good looking, huge IQ. And I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">looking great. And so I thought, okay, wow, like, he must know the Winklevoss brothers. He must have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">met them previously. And I found out this the first time that he had ever met them. So think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about the awareness that he has to know that they're in the audience to see them, point them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">out and then have this kind of hilarious routine with them. So he's someone who's very sharp,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">very on the ball, very funny. And then his energy levels incredible. So he had started his day at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Mar-a-Lago at 3.30am pacific time, 6.30am his time, then he flew to Arizona, did a Trump rally in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Arizona.

The first is that I think that there is a huge gap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">between how the media tries to portray Donald Trump and what he's like when you meet him in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">person. And that gap is really wide. And so I would say specifically to Democrats and independents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you really do need to sit in the room and feel what it's like. He David, David is right. He is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">charismatic, he's intellectually sharp, and he's funny. And when you put that together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">he can engage an audience for a long time and be totally extemporaneous. The other thing I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">say that is that he is very polite. And he's kind in a way that was disarming and was not what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">expected. And so I felt that I had misjudged him many years in the past. And so I was very glad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that I had an opportunity to sit beside him and to actually interact with him one on one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It was really, really engaging. And so that's that's more about the style. And then about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">substance, what I would say is, it was not just a pro America agenda. But it was, it's very clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that he was pro innovation. So he was really supportive of AI in the details that he talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about. He was very supportive of crypto in those details. And he's very much low regulation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">low taxation. And so when you put that together, it does stand very much in contrast with what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the alternative is. And so I think that both of those things are reason why even if you aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">willing to vote for him, I would encourage everybody to experience what it's like to hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">freeberg, your thoughts on all this go to this.

So your thoughts Chamath on this vote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe the move and what that represents. It's kind of odd that we're in this crazy place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Same.

And it requires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so many things to go right. And so I think in part, that's why three quarters of the Tesla</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">shareholders approved it that 73% is not squeaking over the line. It's not 50% plus a vote. It's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a super majority. And that excluded Kimball and Elon shares. So, and then I think you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this very dangerous form of judicial activism, which essentially ignored the will of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">shareholders and fight to create some administrative ruling that threw up this big question mark. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">then in in typical Elon style, he's like, great, we're just going to get them to vote it again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then yet again, it passes, and it looks like it's going to pass by around 73%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But the problem now is that it's still not clear what happens. I think that there's still some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">question marks where this may not nullify the judge's decision, it may actually create more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">question marks. So hopefully, this gets sorted out, he should get this stock, he never should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">have or these options, he never should have had them taken away. And so I just hope this thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, it becomes a nothing burger.

Not surprising. And then I think the jurisdiction thing is bigger than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe people are thinking because Delaware has been the standard for incorporating companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but Elon is putting his companies in Nevada. And Texas, we saw the stock exchange last week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">getting back to move to Texas. This does seem like there's something about jurisdiction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the water. What are your thoughts, Sachs? Well, I think it's ironic that the winning margin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">73%, is the same margin by which shareholders approved his comp package back in 2018. So again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they got 73% voted for this 2018. Now they voted to reapprove it by the same margin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why they had to do it is because this activist judge in Delaware avoided it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on the grounds that somehow the original shareholder vote wasn't valid. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this is interesting that the margin didn't change because it shows that shareholders aren't in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">grades. Elon delivered what he promised, and now shareholders are upholding their end of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">bargain. And certainly they didn't have to take that position. There were different groups like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">CalSTRS who basically took the position, "What have you done for me lately?" Yeah, you delivered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but we don't have to pay you because of the judge, so we're not going to pay you.

So clearly the market thinks that securing Elon's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">future at the company was the right decision and shareholders did the right thing.

First of all, let me say that, you know, we've talked about AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">General Hospital and all the soap opera issues around open AI. Yeah. And, you know, judge tax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">had opinions on that. Yes. But putting that aside, I mean, everyone acknowledges that their products</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">are awesome. I mean, open AI makes really great products with chat GPT 4.0 being at the top of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the list. And I talked about how, when we moved from chat GPT 4.0 turbo to 4.0 at glue, the speed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and quality went up, you know, at least two x and it felt like 10x. So they have the best language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3174" target="_blank">00:52:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">model as of this point in time. And they also have other products that are really great, like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">whisper API, which does transcription. I mean, there's a whole bunch of tools they have that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3183" target="_blank">00:53:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">are great for developers. So nobody's taking anything away from them on the product side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think you're seeing that in this revenue number. Now, if I was to try and take apart this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">business as an investor, I would separate the b2c business from the b2b business. The b2c is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">consumer subscription plan, people paying $20 a month. I'm one of them, I paid the 20 bucks a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">month is probably the only LLM that I would pay 20 bucks a month for how often you use it daily,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">weekly, monthly, I'd say a handful of times. It's not to be honest, it's not like a daily use for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">me. But I probably use it every week, I would say at least once. Yeah, so I still use it. I have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">say, though, that the other LLMs are catching up. And if Gemini ever gets good enough, or you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3232" target="_blank">00:53:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">when Brock gets to the next level, am I going to stick with that $20 a month plan? I'm not sure it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">depends whether open AI can really maintain the the leadership it has or the perception of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">leadership. Okay, so that's half the business. And then the other part of the business is the b2b,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the API products that effectively they're selling to developers. And that's where I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">place the future value of this company. I mean, as somebody who invests in SAS, when we see a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">business that has b2c subscriptions and b2b, we place all the value on b2b. And the reason is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because historically, the churn rates and b2c are too high. Yeah, five to 10% churn rates are common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">50% a year per month or month 50% churn a year very common.

But it's very hard to avoid the downdraft of consumer churn. And and, you know, on the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hand, on the b2b side, a good b2b business has expansion 120% 150% expansion year over year from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">same customers. In other words, they're ordering more. So you compare this business to Amazon Web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Services, Google Cloud, Azure, that's really the business here.

The question is, do they go up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4061" target="_blank">01:07:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">faster than inflation?

Freeberg, tell me what I got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4067" target="_blank">01:07:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">right. Tell me what I got wrong. I think there are three numbers that matter. Okay, inflation rate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the growth in GDP, and the cost to borrow.

So the economy is only growing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4095" target="_blank">01:08:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">by 1.3%. And it costs more than 3% more each year to buy stuff. So that means everyone's spending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">power is reducing.

And the most important fact is that the interest rates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are still between four and 5%, four and 4.7%.

I think GDP</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4439" target="_blank">01:13:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to shrink. Yeah.

So honestly, I think your introduction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4500" target="_blank">01:15:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">overstated how positive this news was. And that's why I think if you look at the markets right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4506" target="_blank">01:15:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very mixed. Most tech stocks that I'm seeing are actually in the red. And a few of them like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4512" target="_blank">01:15:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Tesla and Apple and Nvidia are up. But the vast majority are in the red. So I think the market is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4518" target="_blank">01:15:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">taking this in stride. I think the big picture here is just we don't know when rate cuts are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going to begin. And I think that Vinnie Lingham had a really interesting take on this, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4527" target="_blank">01:15:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">where he said, look, could Powell cut by a quarter point? Would that matter that much? No,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4533" target="_blank">01:15:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it wouldn't matter that much. But the point is, Powell doesn't want to say that the rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4537" target="_blank">01:15:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">height cycle is over, right? If he were to cut by a quarter point, that by itself wouldn't do much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4544" target="_blank">01:15:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but it would be a huge statement that we're out of the woods on inflation, there's not going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4548" target="_blank">01:15:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">any more hikes coming. And we're beginning a new rate cut cycle. And Powell is clearly unwilling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4553" target="_blank">01:15:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to say that. We're still in this like limbo where he is saying that we don't know when rate cuts are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4558" target="_blank">01:15:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going to begin.

I think, had he not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4626" target="_blank">01:17:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">over promised and under delivered at the end of last year, remember, he was promising a sack set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4631" target="_blank">01:17:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">six or seven rate cuts, and he's delivered bupkis. And the markets were none too pleased. And so now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4638" target="_blank">01:17:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he's just swung the pendulum to the other side, which is he's going to massively under</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4642" target="_blank">01:17:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">promise, and then over deliver if he can. And so as a result, I think he's being much more measured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4648" target="_blank">01:17:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and guarded. I don't think he wants to be wrong here. So I think he's thinking about what most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4652" target="_blank">01:17:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">folks think about when they're at the tail end of their of a job like this. He's not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4656" target="_blank">01:17:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">get reappointed, he's going to go off into the sunset. It's roughly about how history will write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4661" target="_blank">01:17:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">how he handled the transition from that to the next phase, whatever that is. So I think he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4666" target="_blank">01:17:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">probably very interested in making sure he doesn't break the economy. And also that he doesn't seem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4670" target="_blank">01:17:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like he's constantly waffling and unpredictable. But isn't he just an autonomous agent that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4675" target="_blank">01:17:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">meant to respond to the data? I guess I'm not quite understanding the degree of judgment and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4679" target="_blank">01:17:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">discretion that everyone seems to have a free bird. They have a mandate. But if you're asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4684" target="_blank">01:18:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what his incentives are, I think his main incentive at this point is concerned for his historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4690" target="_blank">01:18:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">legacy. And specifically, he wants to be thought of like Volcker, not like Arthur Burns in the 70s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4696" target="_blank">01:18:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Volcker basically crushed inflation even at the cost of recession. And he is worshiped today as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4703" target="_blank">01:18:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the best Fed chair ever. Whereas Burns let inflation slip the leash in the 1970s. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4709" target="_blank">01:18:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">he's not thought of very highly. So I think that Powell's main concern here is with his historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4714" target="_blank">01:18:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">legacy. At this point, I don't think he's expecting to be reappointed. He's wrapping up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4718" target="_blank">01:18:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">his second term already. Now, I think if you go back to 2021, the incentives were a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4724" target="_blank">01:18:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">different. Powell wanted to be reappointed by Biden. And remember that in the summer of 2021,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4729" target="_blank">01:18:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's when the inflation began. We had that surprise 5.1% inflation Brent. Powell was up for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4736" target="_blank">01:18:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">renomination and confirmation in November of 2021. And I think what happened back in that year is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4742" target="_blank">01:19:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">administration downplayed the inflation report. They called it transitory. Yellen did, Biden did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4748" target="_blank">01:19:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Powell had to get on board with that message if he wanted to get confirmed by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4752" target="_blank">01:19:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Democrats. And he did get on board with that message. He repeated the whole transitory point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4756" target="_blank">01:19:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And for that reason, they didn't begin the rate hike cycle until March of the following year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4761" target="_blank">01:19:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And from that May inflation Brent to November, they kept doing QE, even though we had inflation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4767" target="_blank">01:19:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">back in the system. So I think that Powell was actually intensely political in 2021. He knew</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4775" target="_blank">01:19:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who was going to reappoint him and who was going to have to confirm him. And he got on board with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4779" target="_blank">01:19:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that message. And that's why they were so slow to react to the inflation. And I think it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4783" target="_blank">01:19:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">disastrous. And that's one of the reasons why the rate tightening cycle was so steep is because he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4788" target="_blank">01:19:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">had to catch up with all this inflation that he had allowed for nine months longer than he should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4793" target="_blank">01:19:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have. But if you ask me what's his incentive now, I think it's purely about legacy. And he does not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4799" target="_blank">01:19:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">want to let inflation come back after cutting rates a little too soon. So his incentive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4805" target="_blank">01:20:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think at this point is to make sure that he's not wrong again about inflation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4811" target="_blank">01:20:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And to remind everybody, maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4816" target="_blank">01:20:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">rates is the mandate for the Federal Reserve. They're supposed to be independent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4820" target="_blank">01:20:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">famously Reagan pushed Volcker to get rate cuts. And there is a lot of politics involved in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4829" target="_blank">01:20:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so legacy does seem like the organizing principle here. I would agree with Chamath and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4836" target="_blank">01:20:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Sachs that it's legacy, but there's always political pressure here. As you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4840" target="_blank">01:20:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Elizabeth Warren is trying to push him to make cuts for obvious reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4845" target="_blank">01:20:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, no, there's politics when they're up for appointment or for reappointment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4851" target="_blank">01:20:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for confirmation, basically, because they want to get that vote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYMKDiJGcI&t=4855" target="_blank">01:20:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, but there's also subtle pressure.
