This continued for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">two years, so that"—no, what's that word "so that"? "So that all the residents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of Asia"—that's the province—"heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So that little phrase "so that" shows that the effect of Paul's lingering for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">two years in one single urban center resulted in the whole region hearing the word of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord, instead of Paul jumping around to all those villages. So we should seriously consider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">whether one effective strategy for reaching a region that may have lines of transportation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and communication to an urban center, whether focusing on that center might be more strategic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">than focusing, say, on one of the outlying villages. So that's my second observation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjvJwXV5_0&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that we could learn from.
