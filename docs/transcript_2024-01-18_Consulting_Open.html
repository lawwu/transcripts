If you are interested in purchasing a consulting appointment, a private consulting call with me to talk about your financial planning or anything else that you would like to talk about, you can book a call now at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.</p><p>These usually sell out, so if you would like to book a call with me, I would encourage you to do it sooner rather than later, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult. Link is in the show notes. If you need a little bit more information, what can I do for you? Well, frankly, I interview for the job each and every day here on the podcast.</p><p>So if you don't think that there's something specific that I can do to help you, then just keep on listening to the podcast. There's more than a thousand hours of advice and commentary and insights and live Q and A's, et cetera, here available for you. One of the things that many people hire me for is technical financial planning.</p><p>I am a certified financial planner. I have a master's degree in financial planning. In addition to that, I am a chartered life underwriter. That's a life insurance educational designation. I'm a chartered financial consultant, similar financial planning education designation. I am a chartered advisor for senior living. That's a designation that I did with a specialty on advising retirees and post-retirees.</p><p>I'm a registered health underwriter. It's not a designation that is offered anymore, but it's a designation that I did several classes on health insurance and the details of health insurance, both individual and group health insurance. I'm a registered employee benefits consultant. That's also a now defunct designation in the world of financial planning, but it has to do with putting in place group benefit plans, et cetera.</p><p>I'm a chartered advisor of philanthropy, and that one is a financially oriented, excuse me, philanthropy oriented designation that I have as well. So I have a long list of professional certifications and have worked for many years as a professional financial planner. What is unique about the financial planning services that I offer though, is that I do not sell any products.</p><p>I don't sell any investment products. I don't sell any life insurance products. I don't sell any trusts. I don't sell anything to you except an hour of my time. And so if you would like to speak to an independent professional, somebody who can come in, who can speak with you, I have frequently been able to save my clients enormous amounts of money by pointing them in the right direction, pointing them away from the wrong direction.</p><p>I have lots of do-it-yourselfers in my audience that hire me. And I think that's a great bang for your buck. If you'd like to talk to me and just say, "Hey, is there anything missing in our plan?" That's a great solution as well. I'm a lot cheaper than a lot of other financial advisors, et cetera.</p><p>And usually in an hour or so, I can solve some problems pretty quickly. In addition to that, I do a lot of consulting and coaching on all kinds of non-technical stuff. Frequently, I have found myself doing a lot of consulting on international affairs, international planning, ever since that's been something that's entered into my life over the last few years pretty heavily.</p><p>That's been a big significant component of it. I've done a lot of work in the area of philanthropy. I've done a lot of work in the area of business planning, charitable planning, et cetera. And so these are some of the ways that I can serve you. I have hundreds and hundreds of clients.</p><p>I've recently collected a bunch of testimonials. I'm going to be releasing a lot of those testimonials, but today, just one to lead off with. Estella, when I asked for a testimonial, Estella said this, "Consulting with Joshua was insightful. He focuses on your question, makes you think about it, and gives you a clear answer and direction." So I have hundreds and hundreds of satisfied clients.</p><p>I've had now, I think, four dissatisfied clients. So pretty good ratio, pretty good bet that I'd be able to help you with anything that you would like my services on. To book a call today, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult. I don't open up these weeks very frequently, but they are open now.</p><p>So if you'd like to talk to me here in the last two weeks of January, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult. Book today.</p></div></div></body></html>
