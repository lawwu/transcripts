All that said, the exercises I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">about to show you require minimal time investment, no equipment, can be done by most everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pain-free, and have been shown to be very beneficial for strengthening and pain-proofing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your back. Okay, so the first exercise in McGill's Big Three is the curl-up. The curl-up is essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">where you lie down like so with, at first, legs extended. This is where you're going to start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to take your hands and, with palms down, and you're going to put them in the small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of your back, so in the arch of your back, and you actually want to maintain that arch in your back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably want to make your spine nice and long.

You're just going to keep it in a neutral position as if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">were looking straight forward, or in this case, straight up at the ceiling, and then you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially going to, you could keep the elbows down, or you can float the elbows, which is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more difficult. I'll float the elbows, and then you lift your upper torso just a bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and of course, the head goes with it, but you're not going to lead with the head, you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">lead with the chest. Okay, like so, and as you do that, I'm trying to talk while I'm doing this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll feel a nice hard contraction in the abdominals, okay? You're going to hold for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about 10 seconds, and as you do that, you're not going to want to talk like I am now. You're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to want to put the tongue on the roof of your mouth, breathe through your nose, and exhale,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you're going to relax down to the floor again, set the head down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You might want to rest somewhere between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your particular needs, and then you're going to raise up your torso,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">leading with the chest, letting the head follow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">holding for about 10 seconds. You can really get a nice hard contraction of the abdominals there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is going to help to build stability. The reason, as I describe in the episode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for doing these 10-second holds as opposed to a 30-second set or a minute-long set is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">repeated 10-second holds help you to build the neural pathways that allow you to contract those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">muscles very hard, which is the goal here. So, after repeating that, say, three to five times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">per set, okay? So, one set would be, say, three to five 10-second holds with 10 to 30, maybe 60</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">seconds between each hold. It'll be one set with the knee up. You could perform multiple sets with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this knee up and then switch to the other side. I talk about this in the episode. I recommend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">starting with just one set per side and then progressing to about three sets per side. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">going to switch to the other side in this case. So, here, again, it's a nice long spine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this leg extended, this foot planted with a bend in the knee. Use the tops of your hands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so palms down, to find the small of your back. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Float the elbows if you can. Otherwise, you can keep the elbows down if you're not able to do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and then just lift the upper torso and hold for 10 seconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And down. And then you would repeat several times or more for this side, and then you could go back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to the other leg, or simply do all the sets for one leg extended, then all the sets for the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">leg extended. I talk about sets and reps, et cetera, in the episode on how to strengthen and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pain-proof your back. This is a great exercise because it actually takes advantage of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ability to contract the abdominals much harder in this position and more efficiently than crunches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">done the conventional way. And I also talk about in the episode how crunches done the conventional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">way can often exacerbate disc herniation and bulging, whereas this should not. Although,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">again, if you experience pain or exacerbation of pain from doing this, you should cease to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the curl-up. Okay, so the next exercise in Stu McGill's Big Three is the side plank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the side plank can be done through a number of different progressions, which many people find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they have to start with the easiest one and work their way up to the more difficult forms of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">side plank. So the side plank, as the name suggests, is where you get on your side. The easiest way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">start this, meaning to begin this exercise if you haven't done it before, is to do a kind of right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">angle bend in the arm that's in contact with the ground. You make a fist on that side. The knees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are bent, okay, and the feet are stacked. And then you're going to both lift the hips off the ground,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but also push down hard with the arm and the fist that's in contact with the floor. That's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it essentially looks like this, okay. So the idea is to not let the hips sag like so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to try and generate as much of a hard contraction in the abdominal muscles and the muscles of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">core that are on the side here, okay. So that's the first progression you would hold for 10 seconds or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so.

So, what I do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'll get down on the floor like so. I put my hands more or less at clavicle level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit behind, maybe in line with my chest. My feet are together and pointed back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">My elbows are back and then I push up off the ground. Again, tongue on the roof of the mouth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes I'll go up higher like so, but usually it's just to about here and then release</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and relax. And then I'll repeat doing about anywhere from three to five second holds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll do that for maybe five to 10 repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to do fewer now for sake of time. And then on the last repetition, I'll hold,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to go long with the spine, for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and then relax. And I'll do that several times throughout the day. It helped tremendously and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately to relieve my back pain, which was, again, excruciating, was also causing pain in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hip and down the leg. If you listen to the episode on how to strengthen and pain-proof your back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">at least for the back pain that I had, where there was a disc impingement on a nerve root</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and the direction of the herniation of the disc was that away towards my back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it made perfect sense. It does make perfect sense why that would help relieve it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's essentially taking that disc and encouraging it to move back under those vertebrae, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I realize that's not the technical term. For other types of back pain, you might need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">do a slightly different variation or avoid that variation. For instance, if the impingement is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in the front, that exercise would actually exacerbate it. However, what I was doing prior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to that exercise, such as crunches, was actually making the disc herniation worse. So that exercise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I just showed you was the way that I relieve my back pain and many others that I know have used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it to relieve their back pain because it was caused by the same disc herniation pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that's the cobra push-up, sort of up-dog type cobra push-up. I don't have a better name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7HLP96HVNM&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for it.
