Think about if you had to feel you needed 100% certainty to make a decision, how many opportunities would pass you by? Whether it's job opportunities, whether it's the girl or boy that you like that you were too afraid to ask out because you were afraid of rejection.</p><p>It's such a shame to have to think in 100% probability. And so my idea is to create a 70/30 decision-making framework, which states if you believe with a 70% probability or greater your decision is the correct one, the right one, then go with it with 100% conviction while having the humility, knowing that 30% of the time, hopefully less, you'll get it wrong.</p><p>And so long as you don't die or something catastrophic happens, you're going to learn from your mistakes and get better over time.</p></div></div></body></html>
