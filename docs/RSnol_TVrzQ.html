and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, my conversation with Dr. Carl Dyseroth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, thanks for being here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for having me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for people that might not be so familiar with the fields of neuroscience, etc., what is the difference between neurology and psychiatry?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Psychiatry focuses on disorders where we can't see something that's physically wrong, where we don't have a measurable, where there's no blood test that makes the diagnosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no brain scan that tells us this is schizophrenia, this is depression for an individual patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so psychiatry is much more mysterious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And the only tools we have are words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Neurologists are fantastic physicians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They see the stroke on brain scans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They see the seizure and the pre-seizure activity with an EEG.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And they can measure and treat based on those measurables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">In psychiatry, we have a harder job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We use words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We have rating scales for symptoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We can measure depression and autism with rating scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But those are words still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And ultimately, that's what psychiatry is built around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an odd situation because we've got the most complex, beautiful, mysterious, incredibly engineered object in the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet all we have are words to find our way in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So do you find that if a patient is very verbal or hyperverbal, that you have an easier time diagnosing them as opposed to somebody who's more quiet and reserved?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I can imagine the opposite might be true as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, because we only have words, you've put your finger on a key point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If they don't speak that much in principle, it's harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The lack of speech can be a symptom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see that in depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see that in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see that in autism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes by itself, that is a symptom of reduced speech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But ultimately, you do need something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You need some words to help guide you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that, in fact, there's challenges that I can tell you about where patients with depression who are so depressed they can't speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes it a bit of a challenge to distinguish depression from some of the other reasons they might not be speaking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is sort of the art and the science of psychiatry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think we will ever have a blood test for depression or schizophrenia or autism?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And would that be a good or a bad thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think ultimately there will be quantitative tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Already, efforts are being made to look at certain rhythms in the brain using external EEGs to look at brain waves effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But ultimately, what's going on in the brain in psychiatric disease is physical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's due to the circuits and the connections and the projections in the brain that are not working as they would in a typical situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do think we'll have those measurables at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Could it be abused or misused?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's, I think, true for all of medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to know, and I'm sure there are several, but what do you see as the biggest challenge facing psychiatry and the treatment of mental illness today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're making progress on what the biggest challenge is, which I think there's still such a strong stigma for psychiatric disease that patients often don't come to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they feel that they should be able to handle this on their own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can slow treatment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It can lead to, you know, worsening symptoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We know, for example, patients who have untreated anxiety issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">If you go for a year or more with a serious untreated anxiety issue, that can convert to depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You can add another problem on top of the anxiety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it would be, you know, why do people not come for treatment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They feel like this is something they should be able to master on their own, which can be true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But usually some help is a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That raises a question related to something I heard you say many years ago at a lecture, which was that this was a scientific lecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you said, you know, we don't know how other people feel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the time, we don't even really know how we feel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the dearth of ways that we have to talk about feelings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's so many words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know how many, but I'm guessing there are more than a dozen words to describe the state that I call sadness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But as far as I understand, we don't have any way of comparing that in a real objective sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So how, as a psychiatrist, when your job is to use words to diagnose, words of the patient to diagnose, do you maneuver around that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And what is this landscape that we call feelings or emotions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">This is really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">People, here we have, there's a tension between the words that we've built up in the clinic that mean something to the physicians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the colloquial use of words that may not be the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's the first level we have to sort out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">When someone says, you know, I'm depressed, what exactly do they mean by that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That may be different from what we're talking about in terms of depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So part of psychiatry is to get beyond that word and to get into how they're actually feeling, get rid of the jargon and get to real world examples of how they're feeling.</span></div><div

in psychiatry, the frustrating thing is that we don't have the level of understanding that a cardiologist has in thinking about the heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the heart is, we now know, it's a pump.</span></div><div class="c"><span

that frame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's clearly a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the element of the brain that's analogous to the pumping heart?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">When we think about the symptoms of depression, that's maybe, you know, we think about motivation and dopamine neurons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then that turns our attention as neuroscientists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we think, okay, let's think about the parts of the brain that are involved in dealing with merging complex data streams that are very high in bit rate that need to be fused together into a unitary concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that starts to guide us and maybe we can, and we know other animals are social in their own way and we can study those animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that there's, that's how I think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There's hope for the future, thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might, and trying to identify the circuits that are likely working to make this typical behavior happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And that will help us understand how it becomes a typical, we need to know the circuits, we need to know the cells in the various brain regions and end portions of the body and how they connect to one another and what the patterns of activity are under a normal, quote unquote, healthy interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If we understand that, then it seems that the next step, which of course could be carried out in parallel, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That work can be done alongside work where various elements within those circuits are tweaked just right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the tuning of a piano in the subtle way, or maybe even like the replacement of a whole set of keys if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">In 2015, there was this, what I thought was a very nice article published in the New Yorker, describing your work and the current state of your work in the laboratory, in the clinic, and an interaction with a patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was, as I recall, a woman who was severely depressed, and you reported in that article, some of the discussion with this patient, and then in real time, increase the activation of the so-called vagus nerve, this 10th cranial nerve that extends out of the cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The skull and innervates many of the viscera and body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the potential for channel rhodopsins or related types of algae engineering to be used to manipulate the vagus?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I believe in that instance, it wasn't channel-opsin stimulation, it was electrical stimulation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Or to manipulate, for instance, a very small localized region of the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me frame it a little bit differently in light of what we were talking about a couple of minutes ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">My understanding is that if somebody has severe depression, and they take any number of the available pharmaceutical agents that are out there, SSRI, serotonin or chick agents, increase dopamine, increase whatever, that sometimes they experience relief, but there are often serious side effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they don't experience relief, but as I understand it, channel-opsins and their related technology in principle would allow you to turn on or off the specific regions of the brain that lead to the depressive symptoms, or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit or a positive anticipation circuit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Where are we at now in terms of bringing this technology to the nervous system?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's start with the body, and then move into the skull.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So starting with the body is a good example because it highlights the opportunity and how far we have to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take this example of vagus nerve stimulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So the vagus nerve, it's the 10th cranial nerve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes from the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It goes down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=821"

target="_blank">00:13:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">By innervate, I mean it sends little connections down to help guide what happens in these organs in the abdomen and chest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It also collects information back, and there's information coming back from all those organs that also go through this vagus nerve, the 10th cranial nerve, back to the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is somewhat of a superhighway to the brain then, was the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe the idea is maybe we could put a little cuff, a little electrical device around the vagus nerve itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So a way of getting into the brain without putting something physical into the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But, uh, and there are a

target="_blank">00:20:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What can be done for it and, uh, what, if any role for channel options or these downstream technologies that you're developing, um, what do they, what do they offer for people that suffer from ADHD or have a family member that suffers from ADHD?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. This is, uh, it's a pretty interesting branch of, of psychiatry. There's no question that people have been helped by the, the treatments. Uh, there's, you know, active, you know, debate over, you know, uh, what fraction of people who have these symptoms, uh, can or should be, be, uh, treated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is typically Adderall or stimulants of some kind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, for example, the stimulants. That's right. Um, so ADHD, it's, as, as its name suggests, it has, uh, symptoms of, uh, it can have either a hyperactive, uh, state or an inattentive, uh, state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And, uh, those can be completely separate from each other. You could have a patient who, who, uh, effectively, uh, is, is not hyperactive at all, but can't, uh, remain focused on the, the, what's going on around them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So their body can be still, but their, their mind is darting around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they can be very hyperactive with their body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It happens both ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably rarely is somebody hyperactive with their body, but their mind is still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I notice I have to think complex, abstract thoughts. I notice I have to be very still. So my body has to be almost completely unmoving for me to think very abstractly and, and deeply. Other people are different. Some people, when they're running, they get their best thoughts. I can't even imagine that. My brain does not work that way at all. I have to be totally motionless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is kind of interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you go about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I, I sit, uh, much like this. You know, I, I, I try to have time in each day where I am, I'm literally, uh, sitting, uh, uh, almost in this, in this position, um, but, but without distraction and thinking. And, and so it's kind of a, it's almost meditative in some ways, except it's, it's not, uh, true meditation, but I, I am thinking while not moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You're trying to structure your thoughts in that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but everybody, as you say, is, is, is very different. And so with, with ADHD, you have, the key thing is we want to make sure that this is present across different domains of life, school and home to show that it really is a pervasive pattern, uh, and not something specific to, you know, the teacher or the home situation or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can help patients. It's interesting that, that ADHD is one of those disorders where people are trying to work on quantitative EEG based diagnoses. And so there's some progress toward making up a diagnosis with looking at particular externally detectable brainwave rhythms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a skull cap with some electrodes that don't penetrate the skull.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And this can be done in an hour or two hour session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Has to be done in the clinic, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. In the clinic, right. You have to have the right recording apparatus and so on, but, but, but, uh, that's in principle, uh, as you increasing confidence comes in exactly which measurements, uh, one could even imagine moving toward, you know, home tests. Um, but we're not there yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazing. I think, um, one of the reasons I get asked about it so much is a lot of people wonder if they have ADHD. Uh, do you think that some of the lifestyle factors that, um, inhabit us all these days could induce a subclinical or a clinical like, um, ADHD?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning if I look at people's phone use, including my own, and I don't think of it like addiction, it looks to me and feels to be more like OCD. And I'll come clean here by saying when I was younger, when I was a kid, I had a grunting tick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I used to hide it. I actually used to hide in the closet because my dad would make me stop. And that I used to, I couldn't feel any relief of my mind until I would do this. And actually now if I get very tired, if I've been pushing long hours, it'll come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was not treated for it. Um, but I will confess that I've had the experience of, I always liked sports where I involve a lot of impact. Fortunately, not football, because I went to a high school where the football team was terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe that would have avoided more impact, but things like skateboarding, boxing, they bring relief. I feel clarity after a head hit, which I avoid, but, uh, but I used to say that's the only time I feel truly clear for a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then eventually it dissipated by about age 16, 17, it just disappeared. Um, so I have great, uh, empathy for those that feel like there's something contained in them that won't allow them to focus on what they want to focus on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And these days with the phone and, and all these, uh, email, et cetera, I, I wonder, and I empathize a bit when I hear people saying like, I think I might have ADHD or ADD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think it's possible that our behaviors and our interaction with the sensory world, which is really what phones and email really are, could induce ADD or reactivate it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I, this is a great question. I, I think about it a lot. There's, you know, and you, you mentioned this, this, uh, tick like behavior in yourself. It's very common that people who have ticks have this building up of something that can only be relieved by executing the tick, which can be a motor movement or, or vocalization or even a thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and, and, and people do, I think these days do have this, if they haven't checked their phone in a while, they do have a buildup and buildup and buildup until they can, they can check it and relieve it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, and, and there's some similarities, you know, there is a little reward that comes with the, with the, the, the checking. Um, but the key question in all of psychiatry, what we do is we, we don't diagnose something unless it's disrupting what we call social or occupational functioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you could have any number of symptoms, but literally every, every psychiatric diagnosis requires that it has to be disrupting someone's social or occupational functioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And these days, you know, checking your phone is pretty adaptive. That pretty much helps your social and occupational functioning. And so we can't, we can't make, we can't make it a psychiatric diagnosis, at least in the world of today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd love your thoughts on, uh, psychedelic medicine, putting them into patients and seeing tremendous positive effects, but also, um, tremendous examples of, um, induced psychiatric illness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, many people lost their minds as a consequence of overuse of psychedelics. I'll probably lose a few, um, people out there. Uh, but I do want to talk about what is the state of these compounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realize it's a huge category of compounds, but LSD and psilocybin, as I understand, trigger activation of particular serotonin receptor mechanisms may or may not lead to more widespread activation of the brain more that one wouldn't see otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you look at the clinical and experimental literature, what is your sort of top contour sense of how effective these tools are going to be for treating depression?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you're, you're right to highlight both the opportunity and, and the peril that is there. Um, and of course we want to help patients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course we want to, to, to explore anything that might be, uh, be, be helpful and, but we want to do it in a safe and rigorous way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But I, I, I do think we should explore these, these avenues. These are, um, agents that alter reality and alter the experience of reality, I should say in, in relatively precise ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They, they, they, they do have problems. They can be addictive. They can cause lasting change that is not desirable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that said, uh, even as these medications exist now, as you know, there's, uh, an impulse to, to use them in very small doses and to use them as adjunctive, uh, treatments for, for the therapy of various kinds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, I, I'm also supportive of that if done, you know, carefully and rigorously, of course there's risk, but there's risk with many other kinds of, of treatment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure that the risks, uh, for these, uh, medications, uh, vastly outweigh the risks that we normally tolerate in other branches of medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would they work? I mean, the, um, you know, let's say, uh, that indeed their main effect is to create more, uh, more connectivity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">connectivity, at least in the, in the moment, uh, between brain areas. So psychedelic seemed to be a, a trajectory. I'm not off too far off from the dream state where space and time are essentially not as rigid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is this element of synesthesia of blending of the senses, um, you know, feeling colors and, um, hearing, uh, light and things of that sort. It, you hear these reports anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, why would having that dreamlike experience somehow relieve depression long-term? Do we have any idea why that might be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Uh, uh, we have some ideas and no, no deep understanding. Uh, one way I, I think about the psychedelics is they, um, increase our willingness to our, they increase the willingness of our brain to accept, uh, unlikely, uh, ways of constructing the world, unlikely hypotheses, as it were, as to what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the brain in particular cortex, I think is a hypothesis generation and testing machine. It's coming up with models about everything. It's got a lot of bits of data coming in and it's making models and updating the models and changing them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Theories, hypotheses for what's going on. And some of those never reach our conscious mind. And this is something I talk about in projections in the, in the book, uh, quite a bit is many of these are filtered out before they get to our, our conscious mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and that's good. We, we, we, we think how distracted we'd be if we were constantly having to evaluate all these, you know, hypotheses about, you know, what kinds of shapes or objects or processes were out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of this is, is handled, uh, uh, before it gets to consciousness. What the psychedelics seem to do is they change the, uh, threshold for us to become aware of these incomplete hypotheses or wrong hypotheses or, or, or concepts that might be noise, uh, but are just wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so are never allowed to get into our conscious mind. Now, you know, that, that's pretty interesting and it goes wrong in psychiatric disorders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, uh, in, in schizophrenia, sometimes the paranoid, uh, delusions that people have are examples of these, uh, poor models that escape into the conscious mind and become, uh, accepted as reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And they never should have gotten out there. Now, how could something like this in the right way help with something like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">something like depression? Patients with depression often are, uh, are stuck. They, they can't, uh, uh, look into the future world of possibilities as effectively. There's everything seems, uh, hopeless. And what does that really mean? They, they discount the value of their own action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They discount the value of their own action. They discount the value of the world at giving rise to a future that matters. Everything seems to run out like a river, just running out into a desert and drying up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And what these agents may do that increase the flow through circuitry, if you will, the percolation of activity through circuitry may end up doing for depression is increasing the, the, the escape of some, some tendrils of, of, of process of, of forward progression through, through the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, that's a concept. That's a concept. That's how I think about it. There are ways we can make that rigorous. We, we can indeed identify in the brain by recording. We can see cells that represent steps along a path and look into the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can see if these are altered on psychedelics. And so that's one of the reasons that we're, uh, working with these agents in the laboratory to say, are, is this really the case? Are these opening up new paths, uh, or, or representations of paths into the future?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">MDMA ecstasy is a unique compound in that it leads to big increases in brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. And, uh, I realized that the neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin often work in concert, not alone the way they're commonly described in the, um, you know, the more general popular discussions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">However, uh, it is a unique compound and it's different than the serotonergic compounds like LSD and psilocybin. And there are now data, um, still emerging that it might be, and, and in some cases can be useful for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and, and similar things. Why, why would that work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would that work? And do you, and a larger question, perhaps the more important question is psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those compounds there to, in my mind, there are two components. There's the experience you have while you're on them. And then there's the effect they have after people are generating variations of these compounds that are non hallucinatory variations, but how crucial do you think it is to have the, let's stay with MDMA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">say with MDMA, the experience of huge levels of dopamine, huge levels of serotonin, atypical levels of dopamine, serotonin released, having this highly abnormal experience in order to be normal again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think the brain learns from those experiences. That's, that's the way I see it. And, and so, for example, people on who've taken MDMA, they will, as you say, they'll have, they'll be the acute phase of being, you know, on the drug and experiencing the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this extreme connectedness with other people, for example. And then the, the drug wears off and, but the brain learned from that experience. And so what, what people will report is, yeah, I'm not, I'm not in that state, but I saw what was possible. You know, I saw, yeah, you can, there don't need to be barriers, or at least not as many barriers as, as I thought. I can connect with more people in a, in a way that, that is helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's the learning that happens in that state that actually matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And this, as you described that, that sounds a lot like what I understand to be the hallmark feature of really good psychoanalysis, that the relationship between patient and therapist hopefully evolves to the point where these kinds of tests can be run within the context of that relationship and then exported to other relations. Is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly right, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly right, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that probably, I'm assuming is still the goal of really good psychiatry also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a part of, uh, intimacy really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It, it should be, uh, when we have time, I think all, all good psychiatrists try to achieve that, that level of, of, of connection and learning. Uh, try to help patients, um, create a new, a new model that is stable, that is learned, and that can help instruct future behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that I took from reading your book, in addition to learning so much science and the future of psychiatry and brain science was, um, you know, amidst these very many, in many cases, very tragic cases and, and sadness, and a lot of the, the, uh, the weight that that puts on the clinician, on you also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That there's a, that there's a, that there's a central chord of, of optimism that where we're headed is, uh, not just, um, possible, but very likely and, and better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you know, it, are you an optimist?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I am. And this, this is, by the way, this was a really interesting experience in writing projections because I had a, a, a dual goal. I wanted it to be for everybody, literally everybody in the world who wants to, to, to, to, to read it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet at the same time, I wanted to, uh, stay absolutely rigorously close to the, the science, what was actually known. Um, when I was speaking about science, when I was speaking about the, the neurobiology of the, of the brain or, or psychiatry, I wanted to, to not have any of my scientific colleagues think, oh, he's, he's going too far. He's saying too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I had these, these two goals, which I kept in my mind the entire time. And, and a lot of this trying to find exactly the right word we talked about was on this path of staying excruciatingly rigorous in the science. And yet letting people see the hope, the, the, where things were, have everybody see that we've come a long way. We have a long way to go, but, but the trajectory and the path is, is beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so that, that, that, that was the, the goal. I, I, I think, uh, you know, of course that sounds almost impossible to, to jointly satisfy those two, those two goals, but I, I kept that in my mind the whole way through. And yes, I am optimistic. I, and I hope that came through in the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2241" target="_blank">00:37:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But it certainly did. And at least from this colleague, um, uh, you, you did achieve both. And, um, it's a wonderful, it's, it's a masterful book really. And one that as a scientist and, um, somebody who is a Brit, uh, fellow brain explorer, uh, hits all the marks of, of rigor and is incredibly interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a ton of storytelling. Definitely, uh, check out the book. Um, there are other people in our community that of course are going to, uh, uh, be reaching out on your behalf, but it's, it's incredible that you juggle this enormous number of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, perhaps even more important, however, is that it's all in service to this larger thing of relieving suffering. So thank you so much for your time today for the book and the work that went into the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't even imagine for the laboratory work and the development channel options, clarity, and all the related technologies and, and for the clinical work you're doing and for sharing with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnol_TVrzQ&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, thank you for, for all you're doing and reaching out.
