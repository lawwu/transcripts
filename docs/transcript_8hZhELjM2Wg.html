So if you want to just figure roughly half, that's a good number.</p><p>People who've been goaded by advertising or social media where they're advertising some cost that is 80, 85 percent savings, 90 percent savings, you really want to watch out for that. Cost shopping is one of the biggest mistakes that a medical traveler can make. Those are the people that get into trouble, because the clinic's got to make money too.</p><p>So they can't offer a knee procedure for $800. They got to pay their rent. They got to keep their equipment up. They got to feed their families. So if you aren't within that 50 to 70 percent, 40 to 60 percent cost range, you want to look out. If it's not enough of a savings by the time you add your travel, your accommodations, your dining, and all that, unless you're tacking it on to your procedure, then you're probably not saving enough.</p></div></div></body></html>
