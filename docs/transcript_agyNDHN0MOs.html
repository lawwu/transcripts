Instead of thinking that your idea is the best, why aren't you in a subreddit seeing what the most upvoted posts are over the last month, the last year, et cetera, all time?</p><p>A lot of people don't use any data. And if they do, they also tend to use survey data, which is skewed for many reasons. People are familiar with that. There's a whole lot more search data, which I think is much better, both in terms of scale and the fact that people are actually searching it on their own terms, not being asked a question.</p><p>And then there's a third bucket, which is sales data, which is, you could actually argue even better because people aren't just searching for something or curious about it, but they're actually putting their money where their ideas are. And so that's kind of like the very baseline thing that I think people get wrong.</p><p>Simple as it sounds, they're just not using the data that's accessible to them.</p></div></div></body></html>
