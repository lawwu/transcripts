And it's like, why did somebody put all this effort into it? Like, well, it feels really good because a poster is this really constrained.</p><p>It's like finite, it's ephemeral. You can start it and within a few hours, like, yeah, there's a search space, but you can find a decent part of the search space pretty rapidly. And once you're there, there's this beautiful and very enticing feeling of turning the crank and like making it better and polishing it and trying this or that, but when you're trying this or that, like, all of the options are kind of okay, and you're kind of trying them out of curiosity, or like, maybe it can be even better.</p><p>And that's very different from the kind of design where you're just like, I simply don't know how to do this. And I think it's part of why those designers loved making those posters. It's a snack, it's a treat.</p></div></div></body></html>
