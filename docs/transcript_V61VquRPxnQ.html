We really like stories and we find stories very compelling. And one of the things I've found in all of these years of using data is that I really believe in data. And that's my core, I've trained as an economist. My economics work is very situated in data, I love it.</p><p>If you tell me, here's a piece of data, here's a great randomized trial and here's what you learned from it, I find that very compelling. One of the things I've learned over time is that not everyone finds data as compelling as I do. And there is sometimes a lot of value in helping people understand why data is just a lot of anecdotes altogether.</p><p>When we think about how we can better incorporate the use of data in decisions, one key is to make sure you are asking the question in a thoughtful way that is seeking an answer rather than making our decisions in the moment that someone is coming at us with an anecdote.</p></div></div></body></html>
