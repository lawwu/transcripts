In fact, it wasn't even Einstein. I should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">give more credit to Minkowski in 1907. So Einstein in 1905 figured out that you could get rid of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ether, the idea of a rest frame for the universe, and all the equations of physics would make sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with the speed of light being a maximum. But then it was Minkowski, who used to be Einstein's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">professor in 1907, who realized the most elegant way of thinking about this idea of Einstein's was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to blend space and time together into space-time, to really imagine that there is no hard and fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">division of the four-dimensional world in which we live into space and time separately. Einstein was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at first dismissive of this. He thought it was just like, oh, the mathematicians are over-formalizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">again. But then he later realized that if space-time is a thing, it can have properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And in particular, it can have a geometry. It can be curved from place to place. And that was what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">let him solve the problem of gravity. He had previously been trying to fit in what we knew</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about gravity from Newtonian mechanics, the inverse square law of gravity, to his new relativistic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">theory. It didn't work. So the final leap was to say gravity is the curvature of space-time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that statement is basically general relativity. >> And the tension with Minkowski was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">he was a mathematician. >> Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">>> So there's a tension between physics and mathematics. In fact, in your lecture about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this equation, one of them, you say that Einstein is a better physicist than he gets credit for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yep. >> I know, that's hard.

But then we also, partly based on fact, but partly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to make ourselves feel better, tell ourselves a story about how later in life, Einstein couldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">keep up.

Early in the history of the universe, the dark energy is irrelevant. But remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the density of dark energy stays constant.

The open question in my mind is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6068" target="_blank">01:41:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is the easiest, most efficient, best way to act human to do the same things that human beings do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6075" target="_blank">01:41:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Or are there other ways? And I think that's an open question. I just heard a talk by Melanie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6080" target="_blank">01:41:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Mitchell at Santa Fe Institute, an artificial intelligence researcher. And she told two stories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6085" target="_blank">01:41:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about two different papers, one that someone else wrote and one that her group is following up on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6089" target="_blank">01:41:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were modeling Othello. Othello, the game with a little rectangular board,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6094" target="_blank">01:41:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">white and black squares. So the experiment was the following. They fed a neural network</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6099" target="_blank">01:41:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the moves that were being made in the most symbolic form, like E5.

So it gives a long string. It does this for millions of games,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6111" target="_blank">01:41:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Real legitimate games.

Well, how do you know? And so they construct a little probe network that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6139" target="_blank">01:42:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">insert and you ask it, what is it doing right at this moment, right? And the answer is that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6146" target="_blank">01:42:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">little probe network can ask, would this be legitimate or is this token white or black or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6151" target="_blank">01:42:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever? Things that in practice would amount to it's invented the Othello board. And it found that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6160" target="_blank">01:42:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the probe got the right answer, not 100% of the time, but more than by chance, substantially more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6167" target="_blank">01:42:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">than by chance. So they said, there's some tentative evidence that this neural network</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6174" target="_blank">01:42:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">has discovered the Othello board just out of data, raw data, right? But then Melanie's group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6180" target="_blank">01:43:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">asked the question, okay, are you sure that that understanding of the Othello board wasn't built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=6187" target="_blank">01:43:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">into your probe?

But it's interesting because our techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8270" target="_blank">02:17:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">are entirely different.

And then that will be vastly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8280" target="_blank">02:18:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">compressed, edited, rewritten or whatever until the final thing happens.

So a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8292" target="_blank">02:18:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of it happens. There might be some scribbles for an outline or something like that, but a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8296" target="_blank">02:18:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of it is in my brain before it's on the page. >> So that's the case for the biggest ideas in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8300" target="_blank">02:18:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the universe, the quanta book and the space-time motion book?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8302" target="_blank">02:18:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah, quanta and fields, which is actually mostly about quantum field theory and particle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8307" target="_blank">02:18:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">physics. That's coming out in May. And that is, I'm letting people in on things that no other book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8315" target="_blank">02:18:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">lets them in on. So I hope it's worth it. It's a challenge because there's a lot of equations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8319" target="_blank">02:18:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I mean, you did the same thing with space-time motion. You did something quite interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8324" target="_blank">02:18:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like you made the equation the centerpiece of a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8328" target="_blank">02:18:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Right. There's a lot of equations. Book two goes further in those directions than book one did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8336" target="_blank">02:18:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's more cool stuff. It's also more mind-bending. It's more of a challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8343" target="_blank">02:19:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Book three that I'm writing right now is called Complexity and Emergence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8348" target="_blank">02:19:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Oh, wow. >> And that'll be the final</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8350" target="_blank">02:19:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the trilogy. >> Oh, that's fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8352" target="_blank">02:19:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of probably ideas there.

But the point of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI&t=8368" target="_blank">02:19:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">these books is to say things that 500 years from now will still be true.
