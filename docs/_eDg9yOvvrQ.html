been a clear example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of a true human

absolutely clear,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what is undeniable is that there are chemicals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that human beings make and release in things like tears</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">layers onto our skin and sweat and even breath that powerfully modulate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or control the biology of other individuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There are things floating around in the environment, which we call volatile chemicals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you actually smell something, like let's say you smell a wonderfully smelling rose or cake,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, you are inhaling the particles into your nose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There are literally little particles of those chemicals are going up into your nose and being detected by your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Other ways of getting chemicals into our system is by putting them in our mouth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">by literally taking foods and chewing them or sucking on them and breaking them down into their component parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's one way that we sense chemicals with this thing, our tongue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So these chemicals, we sometimes bring into our body, into our biology through deliberate action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We select a food, we chew that food and we do it intentionally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes they're coming into our body through non-deliberate action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We enter an environment and there's smoke and we smell the smoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a consequence, we take action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes, however, other people are actively making chemicals with their body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, this would be with their breath, with their tears,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">or possibly, I want to underscore possibly, by making what are called pheromones,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">molecules that they release into the environment, typically through the breath,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that enter our system through our nose, our eyes, or our mouth, that fundamentally change our biology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just give an example, which is a very salient and interesting one that was published</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about 10 years ago in the journal Science, showing that humans, men in particular in this study,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have a strong biological response and hormonal response to the tears of women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What they did is they had women, and in this case, it was only women for whatever reason, cry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and they collected their tears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Men that smelled these tears were smelled by male subjects or male subjects got what was essentially the control,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which was the saline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Men that smelled these tears that were evoked by sadness had a reduction in their testosterone levels that was significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">They also had a reduction in brain areas that were associated with sexual arousal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They actually recruited subjects that had a high propensity for crying at sad movies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which was not all women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What they were really trying to do is just get tears that were authentically cried in response to sadness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sadness as opposed to, you know, putting some irritant in the eye and collecting tears that were evoked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">by something else like just having the eyes irritated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Nonetheless, what this study illustrates is that there are chemicals in tears that are evoking or changing the biology of other individuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I didn't select this study as an example because I want to focus on the effects of tears on hormones per se,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">although I do find the results really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I chose it because I wanted to just emphasize or underscore the fact that chemicals that are made by other individuals are powerfully modulating our internal state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's something that most of us don't appreciate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think most of us can appreciate the fact that if we smell something putrid, we tend to retract or if we smell something delicious, we tend to lean into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are all these ways in which chemicals are affecting our biology and interpersonal communication using chemicals is not something that we hear that often about, but it's super interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about smell and what smell is and how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to make this very basic, but I am going to touch on some of the core elements of the neurobiology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's how smell works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Smell starts with sniffing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that might come as no surprise, but no volatile chemicals can enter our nose unless we inhale them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If our nose is occluded or if we're actively exhaling, it's much more difficult for smells to enter our nose, which is why people cover their nose when something smells bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the way that these volatile odors come into the nose is interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The nose has a mucosal lining, mucus, that is designed to trap things, to actually bring things in and get stuck there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">At the base of your brain, so you could actually imagine this, or if you wanted, you could touch the roof of your mouth, but right above the mouth, about two centimeters is your olfactory bulb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The olfactory bulb is a collection of neurons, and those neurons actually extend out of the skull, out of your skull, into your nose, into the mucosal lining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this means, in kind of a literal sense, is that you have neurons that extend their little dendrites and axolony-like things, or little processes, as we call them, out into the mucus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And they respond to different odorant compounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the olfactory neurons also send a branch deeper into the brain, and they split off into three different paths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So one path is for what we call innate odor responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have some hardwired aspects to the way that you smell the world, that were there from the day you were born, and that will be there until the day you die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the pathways and the neurons that respond to things like smoke, which, as you can imagine, there's a highly adaptive function to being able to detect burning things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">burning things, because burning things generally means lack of safety or impending threat of some kind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It calls for action, and indeed, these neurons project to a central area of the brain called the amygdala, which is often discussed in terms of fear, but it's really a fear and threat detection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You also have neurons in your nose that respond to odorants or combinations of odorants that evoke a sense of desire and what we call appetitive behaviors, approach behaviors that make you want to move toward something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you smell a delicious cookie or some dish that's really savory that you really like, that's because of these innate pathway, these pathways that require no learning whatsoever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, some of the pathways from the nose, these olfactory neurons into the brain are involved in learned associations with odors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Many people have this experience that they can remember the smell of their grandmother's home or the smell of particular items baking or on the stove in a particular environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, these memories tend to be of a kind of nurturing sort of feeling safe and protected, but one of the reasons why olfaction, smell, is so closely tied to memory is because olfaction is the most ancient sense that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have pathway for innate responses and a pathway for learned responses, and then we have this other pathway, and in humans, it's a little bit controversial as to whether or not it sits truly separate from the standard olfactory system or whether or not it's its own system embedded in there, but that they call the accessory olfactory pathway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Accessory olfactory pathway is what in other animals is responsible for true pheromone effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, in rodents and in some primates, including mandrills, if you've ever seen a mandrill, they have these like big beak noses things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You may have seen them at the zoo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There are strong pheromone effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of those include things like if you take a pregnant female rodent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">or mandrill, you take away the

class="t">and you introduce the scent of the urine or the fur of a novel male,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">she will spontaneously abort or miscarry those fetuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very powerful effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Another example of a pheromone effect is called the Vandenberg effect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">named after the person who discovered this effect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">where you take a female of a given species that has not entered puberty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You expose her to the scent or the urine from a sexually competent, meaning post-pubertal male,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and she spontaneously goes into puberty earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So something about the scent triggers something through this accessory olfactory system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a true pheromonal effect and creates ovulation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And menstruation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Or in rodents, it's an estrous cycle, not a menstrual cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.480</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:10:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">there are chemical sensing between individuals that may be independent of the nose,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to talk about the act of

while we're all trying or we're told that we should eat less sugar, for a variety of reasons, the ability to sense whether or not a food has rapid energy source or could give rise to glucose is essential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have sweet

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The Coolidge effect is the effect of a male of a given species.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">In most cases, it tended to be a rodent or a rooster mating and at some point reaching exhaustion or the inability to mate again because they just simply couldn't for whatever reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The Coolidge effect establishes that if you swap out the hen with a new hen or the female rat or mouse with a new one, then the rat or the rooster spontaneously regains their ability to mate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Somehow their vigor is returned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The refractory period after mating that normally occurs is abolished and they can mate again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But it turns out that females also will, female rodents will mate to exhaustion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And at some point, excuse me, they will refuse to mate any longer unless you swap in a new male.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then because mating in rodents involves the female being receptive, there are a certain number of behaviors that mean that she, that tell you that she's willing and wanting to mate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So-called lordosis reflects, then if there's a new male, she will spontaneously regain the lordosis reflex and the desire to mate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we know it's a pheromonal effect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this recovery of the desire and ability to mate, both in males and in females, can be evoked completely by the odor of a new male or female.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't even have to be the presentation of the actual animal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how you know that it's not some visual interaction or some other interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a pheromonal interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, as I mentioned earlier, pheromonal effects, humans have been debated for a long period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We are thought to have a vestigial, meaning a kind of shrunken down miniature accessory olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ or the vomeronasal organ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people don't believe that Jacobson's organ is this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a little dents as you go up through your nasal passages.</span></div><div

vomeronasal-like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Vomeronasal is the pheromonal organ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They call it Jacobson's organ if it's present in humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.160</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:30:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if that organ, Jacobson's organ, isn't there or is not responsible for the chemical signaling between individuals, there is chemical signaling between human beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">As I mentioned earlier, the effect of tears in suppressing the areas of the brain that are involved in sexual desire and testosterone of males.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a concrete result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very good result published by an excellent group.</span></div><div

signaling between females in terms of synchronization of menstrual cycles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the original paper on this was published in the 1970s by McClintock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And it essentially said that when women live together in group housing, dormitories, and similar, that their menstrual cycles were synchronized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was due to what was hypothesized to be pheromonal effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the years, that study has been challenged many, many times.</span></div><div

chemical-chemical signaling between women in ways that impact the timing of the menstrual cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that a pheromonal effect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, by the strict definition of a pheromone, a molecule that's released from one individual that impacts the biology of another individual, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not clear what the chemical compound is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">None of this surprises me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">None of this should surprise

have a profound effect on a large number of systems in our biology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that smell and that smell and taste and the ability to sense the chemical states of others, either consciously or subconsciously, have a profound influence on whether or not we might want to spend time with them, whether or not this is somebody that we're pair-bonded with, whether or not this is somebody that we just met and don't trust yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And given what's at stake in terms of reproductive biology, it makes so much sense that much of our biology is wired toward detecting and sensing whether or not things and people are things that we should approach or avoid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDg9yOvvrQ&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why we're trying to
