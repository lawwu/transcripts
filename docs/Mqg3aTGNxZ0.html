But first I want to address the thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that you must be having. How could these guys have discovered so much when the model has only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">been out a week? Well first as they lay out in the introduction they have interacted with GPT-4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">during its early development. These researchers from Microsoft have had the model for months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as early as October of last year or even earlier. They had the raw model, the unrestricted version,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">not the final version of GPT-4 that had been fine-tuned to improve safety and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">reduce the risk of infection. So they had to find a way to get the model out of the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had around six months to experiment with the unrestrained GPT-4. That's enough build-up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's time to get to the revelations. And all of them I'm going to do in order aside from this one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">because honestly it blew my mind. On page 45 they say GPT-4 is able to use tools with very minimal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">instruction and no demonstrations and they make use of them appropriately. They go on to say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this is an emergent capability and ChatGPT could not do this. Before I get into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">details I must remind myself that one of the key moments in human evolution was when we discovered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">how to use tools. So the fact that GPT-4 can use them so well and ChatGPT couldn't is truly a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">milestone in AI and human history. I'm going to show you more examples throughout the video but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">let's start with their examples. It knows when it needs to use a calculator and can use it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">effectively. In my path to AGI video I talk about how it struggles with characters and it knows how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to call a character API and work out the number of characters. So let's get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing I want to talk about is the ability to use tools. So if you're using a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">calculator you can use tools to call a character API and work out the number of characters. Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">might not seem impressive but that was one of its key weaknesses before. If that didn't impress you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how about text to image? GPT-4 can output detailed images based on a text prompt. These can then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">easily be rendered into more detailed drawings using a model like stable diffusion version 2.1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Notice how the model knew how to arrange the objects based on the text prompt. At this point I can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">really explain how it can be used effectively. So let's start with the first example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're using a calculator and you can use it effectively you can use it to call a character API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and work out the number of characters.
