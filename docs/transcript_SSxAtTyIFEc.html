Patrick asks, how would you approach including non-work activities into my workday? Well, if it's during the actual hours of your workday, so after your time block plan begins, but before you do your shutdown ritual for the day, you just time block it.</p><p>You just time block it like any other thing you would do. In fact, time blocking it allows you to find the best times for scheduling this non-work related activity. You have some control over where that's going to fall, so it's not just happening randomly. You're more likely to get more of it done.</p><p>I do this, for example, with exercising and for sure with book reading, where I'll just block off a time for book reading. The other thing you can do is just shut your days down earlier on some days. So I can end my day at 3.30, full schedule shutdown complete, 3.30 to 5.30, I'm doing my leisure activity I'm really into.</p><p>That's a great period. I love that end of the day period where other people are working, but you're done because you're organized and you're in control, and you can end that day early without it being a crisis because you've controlled all of your time, you've controlled your weeks, you've controlled your semester plans, and so you might try doing that as well.</p><p>But just time block that like anything else.</p></div></div></body></html>
