Clark Kent is not going to tell people he's Superman. Bruce Wayne doesn't run around saying, 'Hey, I'm Batman.'" So if your mother's maiden name is Smith, tell people it's Jones. If you went to Ridgefield High School, tell them you went to Southwick.</p><p>The key thing is consistency. It's not as if you're doing an interview to get a security clearance for national security. All you're trying to do is create something that will be a benchmark. So it's not about veracity. It's just about consistency. Sometimes I just have strings of numbers. I use one password and I generate a random string of characters.</p><p>So it's like, "What's your favorite book?" It might be gobbledygook to me. It's just a bunch of numbers and symbols and letters, but it certainly isn't something anyone would guess. And the same goes for the high school I went to or my dog's name or things that you might actually be able to find out online.</p></div></div></body></html>
