Which is a very different conversation. Here, what we're talking about is the neural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">aspects of being able to generate intensity, also blunt cortisol, and get the most out of training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">without putting the body into kind of an emergency state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And the longer someone withholds food after exercise, and the greater they stay in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">catabolic or breakdown state, the more the brain perceives it as being in a low energy state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing to go is lean mass. When you start telling a woman that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're going to do fasted training and or you're going to delay food intake afterwards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">why are you training? Because the first thing that goes is lean mass. And it's really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">really hard for women to put on lean mass. So once you start really nailing that and then saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">look, you just need 15 grams of protein to really help and be able to conserve that lean mass. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a small, simple fix. People try it and they're like, oh my gosh, I feel amazing. So small little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things when you're working with the whole system, because I get tired, especially around Christmas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">time when you're reading all the magazines, it's like two cookies means you have to walk for 30 minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">on the treadmill. It's like, it doesn't, it doesn't correlate like that at all. So that's why I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I hate the calorie conversation because it's just not applicable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And it has its own kind of, um, elements of being laced with neuroticism about calorie counting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that can drift easily into the realm of eating disorders. I did an episode about eating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">disorders some years ago. And as I was researching that episode, um, I learned that people with eating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">disorders, women and men, um, especially anorexia become like calorie calculators, their eyes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">their brain just are constantly evaluating the caloric load of food.

It's, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it's old science, but we look at the research of when women's metabolisms come back down to baseline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning that they have constant straight blood sugar levels versus men, women it's within, uh, 60 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And for men, it's up to three hours.

So when we're looking at women,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">women, we have this tighter window to stop that breakdown effect and start the reparation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so yeah, it's like when we're talking about the protein intake, it's really important not only to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">get that leucine content up in the muscle to start the reparation and repair, but also again, to signal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that, yeah, we're in a building state.

So we look at protein and people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like, well, that's a big dose of protein. How do I get it all in? It's like, yeah, well, you can look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">how we mix all of these things.

So that's why I say you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">could have your next meal after your training session.

At some point, there was a lot of discussion about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0RfPU4kdc&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">training fasted burns more body fat.
