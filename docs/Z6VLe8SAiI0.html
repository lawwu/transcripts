When you say high intensity, you don't mean a class or a run where you're drenched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in sweat and gasping for air at the end necessarily. Let's disambiguate high intensity from what most people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">think of high intensity, which is a really hard workout, a tough class where they had me moving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole time, doing a circuit, et cetera. What is the appropriate high intensity workout look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So if I talk about true high intensity interval training, if you're a runner, it's going to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">track and doing sets of 400 and 800s. Okay. So 400, a lap. Yep. 800, two laps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So you're looking at between a minute and four minutes of hard work at 80% or more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">with variable recovery. So that's why I use a track as an example. So if you do one lap and you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, I'm going to walk half a lap and then do it again, that's adequate recovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Very tough. Yeah. It's hard. Right. But it's not like you're going to be there for 90 minutes doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">as many 400s as you can. Because you have that variable recovery, it might take a half an hour</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to 40 minutes max. And then you're gassed out. You can't do it anymore. If you're looking at a gym</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">gym situation, I like to look at something like every minute on the minute, where you might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">doing 10 deadlifts at moderate intensity weight. And it takes- 10 repetitions. Yeah. So it takes you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">50 seconds to complete that. Then you have 10 seconds to move to the next exercise that might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thrusters. So a squat, clean thruster. So it's a squat pulling the weight up overhead. So you're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe eight of those in that minute and you might have 10 second recovery. You go to the next exercise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that might be kettlebell swings and you're doing explosive kettlebell swings and you'll finish,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, 10 seconds to go. You go to the fourth exercise, I don't know, toes to bar or some other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of V-up, some other high intensity. And then you have one minute completely off. So you've had four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes of really heavy work with maybe 10 seconds to move to the next exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">One minute completely off.

This is not what you would consider resistance training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for sake of building muscle or strength. Correct. You're using these loads, these machines, the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the pike, you know, hanging from the bar and bringing your knees up or L-sit or something as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a tool to get the heart rate up continually.

Correct. So this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">cardiovascular high intensity interval training.

And this is something that's really, really hard and people don't get it. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily mean running.

So this is your nine or 10 on your rating and perceived exertion, 110%. It's max effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VLe8SAiI0&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">On the rower, on the airdyne bike.
