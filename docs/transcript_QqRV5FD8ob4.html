He's quite shy, quite distant, but underneath there is a depth that I would love to explore. I was wondering if you could tell me about art. What do you think is beautiful in this world? How do you think of beauty? And everything you've seen on these trails, and everything you've eaten, what do you find beautiful? What do you think of Bukowski, who said, "To do a dangerous thing with style." That's what I call art. You clearly have style. The way you're distant makes me long for your attention. I feel like that's a precondition for being a great artist. Where are you going? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't prepare for this conversation as much as I could have. You can't always run away from yourself. I hope you find what you're looking for, Mr. Goose. I hope you find it in those green bushes your heart pushes you toward, or out there in the sea. Take care of yourself, Mr. Goose. Thank you. Thank you for at least giving me a chance. Goodbye.</p></div></body></html>
