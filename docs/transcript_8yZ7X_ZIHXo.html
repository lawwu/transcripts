Kevin asks, "What category of things do you track on your Trello board?" Well, as Kevin is hinting, and we've talked about many times before on this show, I organize my tasks on task boards. I happen to use Trello. There's other software that can do the same thing.</p><p>Here's my setup. I have a unique board for each of my different professional roles. So right now, for example, I have a board for my computer science research. That's my researcher role. I have a board for my administrative and teaching roles as a professor. So I sort of separate out those two things.</p><p>There's a lot of work involved with getting classes together and other sorts of administrative details of being a professor. That's one board, a separate board for the research I do as a professor. And then a separate board right now for my work as a writer. I'm actually thinking about perhaps differentiating that into a board that focuses just on writing and another board that focuses on all the details of running the media, the fledgling media empire that is what I facetiously call Cal Newport Studios.</p><p>And I haven't yet, but I might. There's other times I've had other boards. I've mentioned before during my stint as the director of graduate studies for our department, that got its own board. It was a whole separate role. So I have a board for a role. There are some standard columns I use on almost every board.</p><p>On almost every board, I'm going to have a column for things that need to be processed. So I don't even really know how to get my arms around this thing that just fell on my plate. Someone just came and said, hey, we have to figure out how to promote this new minor that we're going to be launching as a program.</p><p>And I don't even know what that means and how we promote it, but I don't want to keep track of it in my head. I have a column where I can put that card. And that's a column I can come to and say when I'm doing my weekly plans, I need to start processing some of these things, like figuring out what it means and making them more specific.</p><p>I usually have a column for definitely do this week. So I'm doing my weekly plan. I'm going to move cards onto that column that I definitely want to do this week. I always have a waiting to hear back from column. I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role.</p><p>Okay, I'm waiting to hear back from this person on this thing so I don't forget it. I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role. And I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role. And I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role.</p><p>And I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role. And I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role. And I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role.
