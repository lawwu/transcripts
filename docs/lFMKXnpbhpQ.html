target="_blank">00:02:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my point is that we're about to see the exact same transformation happen to the world of business at large.</span></div><div

<span class="t">Before it, I had another one called Teamflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember when I started it, I had a perhaps naive understanding of what starting a business entailed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought it was all about building a cool product and bringing it to market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I found out that's actually the fun part, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Before you get there, people -- I see the founders laughing in the audience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Before you get there, you've got to meet with lawyers and incorporate, and meet with bankers and open a bank account,</span></div><div

recruiters and hire a team, and it goes on and on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mean, you guys know, once you have a business, it's not much easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It just keeps going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So when that wave of generated AI came about, all these amazing products that we're seeing that generate copywriting for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">generate images, I was like, that's awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But it doesn't solve my problem of it's just too darn painful to start a business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, the GDP isn't made of copywriters or illustrators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's made of work and actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's when I got interested in agentic AI, AI that can actually automate the menial parts of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There's this amazing movie, Office Space, by the same guy who made Silicon Valley, I highly recommend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's this awful, depressing character in there, named Milton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">He spends his life in some basement doing God knows what, they call it filing TPS reports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the end, Milton does the most productive thing of his career, which is that he burns the building to the ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what we're going to do, figuratively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The cops are coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think this is a symbol that no one is happy with this status quo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">People are always worried about, oh, robots are stealing people's jobs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.540</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:04:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you want to be Milton?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a huge problem when you look at the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The average manager in the U.S. spends 15 hours every week on this kind of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where you spend your life at work and you hate it.</span></div><div

the product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You can ask it to schedule

here is actually pretty cool because it demonstrates another ability of Lindy, which is she continuously learns from her interactions with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So here I was like, help me find half an hour every week with Eric, and she called it Flo Eric, because previously I had asked her to find certain minutes with Eric tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And she did that, but she named the meeting meeting with Flo, and all my meetings are meeting with Flo, so it's not very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, no, I gave her a little bit of feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I called it Flo Eric, and she did so, she renamed the meeting, and she saved the preference for future instances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And generally, I can give any arbitrary preference of any complexity that I want to Lindy, and she'll remember them and honor them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMKXnpbhpQ&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.820</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:06:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you use Lindy, she can pre-draft your replies for you in your inbox, in your voice, for each individual recipient.</span></div><div
