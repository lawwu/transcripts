I you know, I've certainly been involved in this space in agriculture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4725" target="_blank">01:18:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and increasingly doing more of this work in pharmaceuticals and biotech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4730" target="_blank">01:18:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, when you can have large, unique data sets that you can then model using these tools and these capabilities, and be predictive about what the next product iteration should be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4742" target="_blank">01:19:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it can really change the value and the trajectory of your business. One of the big trends in pharma right now is to move from in vitro testing, meaning you're running biochemical experiments in labs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4752" target="_blank">01:19:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in assays, iterating testing, experimenting to see what molecules work or what protein does what and if it binds to the target, and doing more of this in silica, as it's being called, which is in software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4764" target="_blank">01:19:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And rather than just doing testing and software, you can actually use tools like alpha fold that can be predictive of large molecules, and how they can drive outcomes to make decisions about what to put in your pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4775" target="_blank">01:19:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you take 99% of the junk out of the top of your pipeline, and you only focus on the 1% that the software predicts will be more successful, you much more quickly get drug discovery through the pipeline, and you have a much higher hit rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4788" target="_blank">01:19:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So the ROI is extraordinary, particularly when you're talking about multi billion dollar revenue streams coming out the other end of that pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4794" target="_blank">01:19:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think, you know, the way this reads, these guys raised $100 million in a round last year, sold the company for 600 million, it seems very similar to deep mind being bought by alphabet a few years ago, where the application of the team is pretty broad across a number of opportunities, but bio and tech bought them to focus on the kind of pharma space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4813" target="_blank">01:20:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess tax, you know, in the earlier stage, and you know, I see a lot of teams now that are like, hey, we're AI for this or ml for that a lot of pharma and biotech deals have to have the catchphrase ml or AI in their writing now because of the economic improvement of those businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4830" target="_blank">01:20:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you looking at enterprise software businesses that aren't necessarily about the typical subscription model where you sell a seat license and people pay for that, but have this broad tool set and toolkit where these folks are earning revenue share or participating in a services revenue stream for enhancing the value of their their their their partner in the AI or ml space?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4852" target="_blank">01:20:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's the better business model? Because I think this is where so many new teams are starting out is what's the business model? And what should we be focused on with our ml toolkit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4860" target="_blank">01:21:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the short answer is no, we haven't done any deals like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4865" target="_blank">01:21:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we were not pharma investors. So I don't know how I'd be able to evaluate even if it is a software product. I don't know how to evaluate its effect on pharma outcomes. So I mean, we haven't done deals like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4878" target="_blank">01:21:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Verticals. I mean, like, do you look at ml and AI companies that are more services or partner oriented versus just selling seat licenses to a software tool? I mean, is that a big trend you're seeing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4887" target="_blank">01:21:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we have enough data to tell you what the trend is. We did a deal called Pearl, which is creating an AI for dentistry. So what it'll do is it scans in all of the x rays and you know, dental records from from dental practices. And it gives a kind of a second opinion, it can spot things like cavities and things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4908" target="_blank">01:21:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that, or just changes in the condition where it's really powerful is over time, right? If it's got your last six sets of x rays over whatever six year period, it can detect changes that are probably, you know, hard for a human to see. So they think they can get to like better than human sort of diagnosis by using computer vision. And then we invested in it sort of after that, where we realized, okay, this is kind of like a powerful application. So we invested in a company called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4938" target="_blank">01:22:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Robo flow, which creates tools for computer vision. So Pearl created its own tools for taking a large number of, you know, x rays and classifying them and then creating their own AI tools. Robo flow gives you that same tool set, but you can run it on any computer vision project. And they seem to be building a pretty big universe of software developers who are using their tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4963" target="_blank">01:22:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, this was a team that was bought, they bought a 250% team for $600 million that just had this capability set really and a toolkit. Does that change your outlook for investing in ml AI companies, when you see a $600 million exit for effectively a capability, they didn't have, you know, a core product that was in market, they were doing kind of these co development deals. But I mean, how much does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4985" target="_blank">01:23:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5007" target="_blank">01:23:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that AI engineers go for 2 million each, I think is kind of your point, Dave,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5012" target="_blank">01:23:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">on an M&A basis?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5013" target="_blank">01:23:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, you deep mind got bought for what 600 by Google. And I think they had 200 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5018" target="_blank">01:23:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was like 400.

So yeah, it does seem like, and I think deep mind did not have a business concept in mind when they were funded. They just wanted to do research, right? That was kind of the only thing about that company</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5031" target="_blank">01:23:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">platform capability similar to instant deep. I mean, there's a lot of these, that's what I'm pointing out is like some of these platform capabilities end up just getting bought for, you know, huge sums. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5041" target="_blank">01:24:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Strategy as sex points out the amount,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5045" target="_blank">01:24:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you can invest in a company hoping for an unreasonable acquisition, meaning unreasonable, meaning that reason will acquire. Yeah, yeah, like unreasonable, meaning that your own metrics don't reflect that valuation as a business, you might be worth it. As a strategic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5061" target="_blank">01:24:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">acquisition of somebody else. But you you actually raised an interesting question, which is, is a seat model, the right way for one of these companies to price their product. And you may be right that that the seat license model doesn't really work because, like, how many seats do you really need to buy for these companies?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5077" target="_blank">01:24:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, I mean, one of my like, when I'm prompt engineer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5080" target="_blank">01:24:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, when I was true, like, I mean, we've seen this, we've even seen we've had these debates inside the companies I mentioned, where, like, you know, charging a $10, even $100 a month seat doesn't make nearly reflect the value of the insights that are being created. And so yeah, there are like, you know, there, I don't think this has been figured out yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5100" target="_blank">01:25:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is the big question in ML and AI. When I was at Monsanto, you know, we had all this IP licensing deals we do or new products would come to market. And it was never cost plus or simple pricing, it was always about value capture. If in an enterprise setting, you know, because we sold to farmers, it's like, how much value are you delivering for the farmers, if it's $100 a profit an acre, you try and charge an incremental $30 an acre for that product. And it was always a one third value capture model. And the same is true in biotech and pharma, the producer of the product, or the co developer of the product is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5130" target="_blank">01:25:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">often trying to value capture. And it's not a site seat license, and it's not a service fee, it's more, ultimately, we want to get a royalty on the outcome on the improvement that we can deliver to you. And so there's all these novel business models that are emerging, at least that I'm seeing in pharma and biotech, to participate more meaningfully, ultimately, in the drug development outcome, versus just getting charged a fee for doing a service or a fee for a license to a to a software packet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5152" target="_blank">01:25:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the value of these companies has gone down, I was a early investor, series A investor in a company called Flatiron Health, we sold it for $1.9 billion to Roche, that's the biggest exit in this space for this machine learning enabled stuff that happened in 2018. And so what's really happened is the value of acquisition and M&A has gone down, even as the technology capability has gone way, way up. And why is that it's because this stuff has yet to be proven to actually meaningfully improve the hit rate for these drug</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5181" target="_blank">01:26:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">companies. So whether it's biotech, or Roche, or anybody else, the biggest problem we still have is getting the design space, guessing that better. And these machines are better at doing raw calculations, but they're not necessarily better at veering towards this design space over this design space. And so as a result, you're not improving the either the slugging percentage, or the batting average of these pharma companies. And that's why they're paying less and less. So everybody will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5211" target="_blank">01:26:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">have this capability as an adjunct. The thing that you have to do is sort of what what you guys have said, which is, if there's a company that can actually do better guessing at the top of the funnel, the thing that you should probably do is just give it away in return for a back end rev share, and a royalty. And that business also exists. So you know, the best performing company in pharma is a company called royalty pharma. It's a 22 and a half billion dollar company that has 90% EBITDA margins. It exists in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5241" target="_blank">01:27:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Ireland. It's run in New York by this wonderful entrepreneur, Pablo Legareta. But that's what he does. He buys small pieces of royalties. And his whole thing is like the Paul Graham thing at YC. I'll give you just that little amount of support. And all you need is a little lift in valuation to justify giving me the 6%. And the tooling company, the AI company that does that could win who would go to Roche and buy on tech or Lily or somebody else and just say, Look, use my tools. And whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5270" target="_blank">01:27:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">drug you generate off of me. I just want a 3% royalty. And all you need to do is just show a 3% lift across a portfolio of assets. That would be a killer business model. Because if you look at what Pablo has done, over a large number of successes, that's a ginormous company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5287" target="_blank">01:28:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Jake, how I mean, are you investing in the seed stage ml AI companies?

To be honest, we have we are seeing people play with chat GPT, and kind of do, you know, experiments, but, you know, the more I've used chat GPT, we've connected it to our slack. So you can actually ask a question in our slack in a channel called AI testing, and it will give the answer and everybody can see people like playing with it. You know, it's kind of like a parlor trick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5325" target="_blank">01:28:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I'm in like, that phase where I'm like, Yeah, this is impressive. But it didn't actually solve my problem. And it's slightly faster than doing a Google search. So I am thinking there's going to be a really good business created in taking the open source projects and forking them and verticalizing them like, you know, saxes. One that's doing dental work, you know, like this makes sense to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5354" target="_blank">01:29:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody should do it in accounting, somebody should learn all of gap accounting, which is pretty simple, because it's published, FASB, all of this nonsensical accounting rules, and give you 100% guarantee of no malfeasance. So for example, you guys saw this Brazilian company, you want AI accounting, that's your that's your look at this company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5373" target="_blank">01:29:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">logistic, logistic, diligence, look at this company Americana in Brazil, which just torched $20 billion of enterprise value. Why? Because these guys were using Excel to do a bunch of complicated capitalization and cost accounting made two or three years of mistakes, it added up to two or $3 billion. And they're basically going to file bankruptcy in the next few days. That's completely avoidable human error that should never happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5402" target="_blank">01:30:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And an AI would be perfect for that. Like this is not super controversial to just follow gap accounting. Right? Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you need AI for that. I think you just need software like a database would be good. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5415" target="_blank">01:30:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">no, the problem is the database exists today, like everybody sits on top of Oracle GL or workday, it doesn't prevent these errors. So my point is, you got to get humans out of the system, and the AI should be the accountant, the AI knows the rules, generates the P&L and says, this is it. And by the way, that's way better risk management for the CEO and the CFO. Because as you guys know, if you're the CEO of a public company, you have to sign your signature that these things are legitimate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5440" target="_blank">01:30:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5441" target="_blank">01:30:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I would way better know that a computer did it like an open AI algorithm tells me to mop this P&L is perfect. Then some dude I don't know, at Ernst and Young. Okay. I have a question for sacks. saxy poo. Can you please explain to me why Alec Baldwin is going to get charged with manslaughter for this rust thing? That seems really crazy. Can you say, can you explain what happens on a set with guns? And how the hell did this happen? Like what the hell is going on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5467" target="_blank">01:31:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I've produced two movies, but neither one of them involved, you know, guns or shootouts or anything like that. So I haven't had like firsthand experience with this. I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5475" target="_blank">01:31:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you're a gun owner. So you're an intersection of movie producer and gun owner. So it's a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5479" target="_blank">01:31:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I understand the rules of gun safety and that kind of stuff. Look, Alec Baldwin did not follow the rules of gun safety. The first thing I would do if I was ever in handed a gun would be to clear it I'd like check it to see if it was loaded and clear it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5495" target="_blank">01:31:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And you never pointed at you as somebody you always treat a gun as if it's loaded, even if you think it's not, but he was in a very specific situation, which is he's on a movie set. And the person who's handing him the gun is the armor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5508" target="_blank">01:31:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And someone who's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5509" target="_blank">01:31:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and said cold gun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5511" target="_blank">01:31:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly. It's somebody whose job it is to make sure that the gun is handled properly and unloaded and all that kind of stuff. And they're using it on a set. So I agree with you. I don't quite understand why Alec Baldwin is liable in that situation for the gun going off the person who screwed up here. The person who screwed up is the armor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5532" target="_blank">01:32:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Is the armor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5533" target="_blank">01:32:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question person whose job it was to never allow live ammunition on the set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5537" target="_blank">01:32:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But to handle the guns properly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5539" target="_blank">01:32:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">He hired this person. I thought the whole point of guns in movies was that they were finding blanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5544" target="_blank">01:32:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, they were firing blanks, but they had blanks and regular ones in their kit for whatever reason, because they were shooting real ones as well. But this is involuntary manslaughter. And I think Baldwin is also the producer of the film. So I don't know if this has to do with his hiring of the armor, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5564" target="_blank">01:32:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5564" target="_blank">01:32:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that I can that I can speak to. Listen, you you frequently give stars in an independent movie a producer title. He's not responsible for the physical production of the movie. I bet anything he's not. There's a guy called the line producers responsible for the physical production. And my guess is he wasn't even responsible for the business side of the production. They've got other producers for that. So it doesn't make sense to me if they're going to charge him for having some sort of overall liability as a producer to then not charge the other producers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5594" target="_blank">01:33:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That just doesn't make any sense. So I think this producer credit things probably a red herring. Like I said, I think the armor is the person who is singularly responsible for this situation. They're the ones who screwed up. They're the ones who had a responsibility to make sure that the gun handed to an actor. I mean, Alec Baldwin's an actor. Yeah, look, conservatives in social media are dragging the guy because they think he's a douchebag. And he doesn't know how to handle guns. But that's not his job. He doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5620" target="_blank">01:33:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">ask questions. Yeah, movies. Why would you ever have live ammunition on a movie set? You shouldn't they shouldn't have you shouldn't it's a mistake. So it's not as if like the scene is different if you have a real bullet versus a blank. No, it should. As far as I know, it should only be blanks. If I remember right, there was a story about how the gun armory people were taking members of the cast and crew. And they were shooting guns for fun in the desk. And they were doing like they were doing like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5649" target="_blank">01:34:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">targets and messing around and teaching people gun stuff and just playing around but using live ammunition. And that that led into an accident that there wasn't good kind of transition. That's really bad. That sounds like the kind of negligence that caused this. But unless there are facts we don't know about. I don't know why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5666" target="_blank">01:34:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I was also being charged by the way with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5668" target="_blank">01:34:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, yes. I was being charged with the armor. That sounds totally legit to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5673" target="_blank">01:34:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So guys, listen, I need to run another call. I was going to talk about this really fantastic paper on the one of the driving forces of aging, as demonstrated by a team from Harvard, in collaboration with many others on epigenetics. And the loss of data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5694" target="_blank">01:34:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">integrity and epigenetics really being the core driver of aging in mammalian cells. It's an incredible paper. It speaks a lot to what we talked about last year, Yamanaka factors, and partial epigenetic reprogramming of cells, how they can reverse aging, these guys have demonstrated it in a really powerful way. I'd love to spend some time on it. Maybe we pump that science corner to next week. Wrap up for today. I think we've talked about all sorts of fun stuff. It's been a real pleasure and an honor to be in the seat of the world's greatest moderator. We miss him today. We honor him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5724" target="_blank">01:35:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We look forward to having his return next week.
