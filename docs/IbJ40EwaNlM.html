and you need to have an environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbJ40EwaNlM&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to

before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbJ40EwaNlM&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">gnii wasn't really applicable to
