to the right side of the street to get me, then bill it to my company and take the shortest route because the software was tracking this route to make sure that he didn't take me on a

was so precious that you basically stopped doing whatever you were doing when the sun went down and went to bed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

paraffin, eventually gasoline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All

lighting from the carbon arc lamp and then Edison's light bulb, and that gets us to modern times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

can only be done by governments, and economists have generally categorized those as public goods and externalities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

individually, you wouldn't get it, like national defense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody's going to pay for national defense without being required to because you could become a free rider on other people paying for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other is externalities, when you can get someone else to pay part of your costs by polluting a river instead of paying to get rid of the waste matter that you generate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

several factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One was the increasing wealth of the country made it possible to have these higher levels of government spending and taxation without depriving people of necessities, and we're seeing that now in China and India.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're beginning to clean up their environment, too, but at earlier stages in their development than we did because smart people learn from other people's mistakes instead of waiting to make their own.</span></div><div

Nixon administration that was committed to that policy, and I don't know why him, but we had other fish to fry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had a government in the 1940s, and we should have, so the first world has become

industrialized countries, and I'm counting China and India in those, are later on the curve, and they're the source of most of our pollution now, and that will improve if we don't cut off our noses to spite our face and stop trading and limit the economic growth made possible by capitalism, globalization, and free trade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are the three key factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

they have become multi-billionaires, and I feel they sometimes get a bad rap, I mean, at least in the mass media, they talk about millionaires and billionaires eating their caviar and cruising on their yachts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of these very wealthy entrepreneurs are taking their money and doing it for a lot of public good in order to try to help the world eradicate sickness, and could you talk about, we talked about the public side of things, can we talk about the private side of things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure, and I'm bound to offend somebody here. I think that Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are the exemplars of giving away a lot of money in ways that do good, but they're not the only ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you take someone who has not given away a lot of money, and I'd like to mention Jeff Bezos, because he has more than either of those other two guys, and he hasn't really started giving it away in a meaningful way, that money is not gone from the world economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's invested in businesses, it's invested in the stocks and bonds of companies and governments. If he does buy a yacht, is he doing anybody any good? Well, if you know anybody who builds yachts, and I do, they're not rich people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're working people who have a payroll of perhaps hundreds, perhaps just dozens of craftsmen and engineers and artisans who make a lot of money if somebody buys a yacht, and they don't make any money if no one buys a yacht.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2574" target="_blank">00:42:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they go out and spend the money they've made on food and clothing and shoes and restaurants. The economy is not a zero-sum game. If somebody makes a lot of money, and that money just sits in an account in the S&P 500 index fund or something like that, it's working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't feel that rich people need to give away their fortunes in order to do social good. I've heard it said, and I tend to agree, that if Bill Gates spent $50 billion starting new businesses, he would do more good than if he started a foundation because of all the people who'd get high-paying jobs and all of the technological improvement that those businesses would create over a period of generations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I do want him to give money away to eradicate malaria in Africa. You've got 300 million people suffering from a disease that doesn't kill them, but it makes them unproductive and slows down their ability to ever really accomplish anything.

But in the past, sometimes when we faced problems, we didn't win. The plague wiped out a third of Europe. The 30 Years War wiped out a third of Germany, and that was basically cultural suicide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nature didn't do it. We did it to ourselves. So with more advanced technology, literacy, communication, transportation, knowledge, we're able to solve the problems that we encounter much more quickly and at lower cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in a couple of years, we'll have killed off the COVID virus with some kind of vaccine, and we'll be on to the next virus. And we'll have a tremendous new body of virological knowledge and epidemiological knowledge that we didn't have with which to face that future challenge. And this is going to keep on going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHRbqDVg-w&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In 2120, as opposed to the year 2020, the poverty of Africa will look a lot more like the poverty of Thailand. It'll still be the poorest continent in the world, but it won't be that poor. And we will have effectively eliminated extreme poverty entirely from the world. That is just unimaginable, even 40 or 50 years ago.
