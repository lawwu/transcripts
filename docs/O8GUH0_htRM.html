It'll either say fig.show or plot.show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=197">00:03:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and then just stop.

For example I uploaded a short file and asked it to rotate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=440">00:07:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">file 180 degrees and it was able to do it. Now I'm not saying that is massively useful but it was able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=447">00:07:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to do it. Here is a similar example. I uploaded an image file and then said can you zoom out from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=453">00:07:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">center of the image. Now initially it did zoom in but then I clarified that I wanted it to zoom out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=459">00:07:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">from the center. Just to be cheeky I also asked can you make it black and white. Oh and I also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=465">00:07:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">asked to add music but it couldn't add music. Anyway here is the end result. By the way it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=471">00:07:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">gave it to me as an mp4 file and look it zooms out from the center and it's made the image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=477">00:07:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">black and white. Now because I got access so recently I honestly haven't explored the limits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=482">00:08:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of what kind of video editing I can do with ChatGPT code interpreter but I will let you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=486">00:08:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when I can. Now back to visualizations. I gave it a hypothetical scenario that sounds kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=492">00:08:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">realistic. I sent 231 CVs, got 32 responses, 12 phone interviews, three follow-up face-to-face</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=499">00:08:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">interviews and one job offer which I rejected. I output a downloadable Sankey diagram of this data. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=506">00:08:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">did then get it to change the coloring slightly but I think that's a pretty cool Sankey diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=512">00:08:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Look sent CVs 231 and then receive responses and you can go down 32 phone interviews, 12</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=519">00:08:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">face-to-face interviews and three job offers and one rejected offer. Obviously I could have tweaked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=525">00:08:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that for hours, make it more visual, make it more interactive, maybe make a gif of it but for two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=531">00:08:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes work I think that's a pretty interesting and incredible output. Next and here is one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=536">00:08:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you might say is a little bit concerning and it's about steganography. Now I will admit I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=542">00:09:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">am not at all an expert in fact I know virtually nothing about it. Essentially what it involves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=546">00:09:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">though is hiding a message inside an image or inside some code and GPT-4 was more than willing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=552">00:09:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to play along and it encoded a secret message into an image. There is the image by the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=557">00:09:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you looked at that you'd think that's totally normal that's just a silly little image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=562">00:09:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Well apparently here's what it can do. To a casual observer it looks like a simple image with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=566">00:09:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">some shapes but it actually contains the hidden message "Hello World" then it provided a python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=572">00:09:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">function which can be used to decode the message from the image. Now obviously this is just a silly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=578">00:09:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">example that is totally harmless but am I being crazy in thinking this is a somewhat concerning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=583">00:09:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">ability for future language models to possess especially when they reach the level of an AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=588">00:09:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Often OpenAI talk about future versions of GPT doing scientific research and finding things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=594">00:09:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">humans wouldn't have discovered. But let me explain that a little bit more. First of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=596">00:09:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">let me pose the scenario that it gets better than any human expert at steganography. But anyway enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=602">00:10:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">from me I'll let the experts weigh in on that one. Next, did you know that GPT-4 with code interpreter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=608">00:10:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">can do text to speech? Just before anyone comments though why did I write "Proceed without further</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=614">00:10:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">question"? Because GPT-4 with code interpreter has a tendency to always ask clarifying questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=620">00:10:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you have access to only 25 messages every three hours you don't want to use up half or more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=626">00:10:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of them on clarifying what it wants to do or saying "yes please do that". But I found writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=631">00:10:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">"proceed without further question" means it gets straight to it and essentially you get double the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=636">00:10:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">number of prompts for your money. Anyway as you can see I asked "turn this entire prompt starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=641">00:10:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from the beginning into a text to speech file". Now quite a few times it denied it had the ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=647">00:10:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this but eventually I got it to work. It was actually when I finally gave it this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=652">00:10:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt and it worked. I say it worked but it didn't quite work as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=656">00:10:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">intended.

Here is the text to speech that it came up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=659">00:10:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">"You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.

The only thing is it had nothing to do with my original prompt. Now anyway when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=685">00:11:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you get access to Code Interpreter play about with text to speech because it is able to do it even if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=691">00:11:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">it denies it. Time for a fun one. I asked "create a tree map of the letters in the following quote"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=696">00:11:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm not going to read it out because I am not good at tongue twisters. Anyway I said "give each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=701">00:11:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the tree map a different color and output a downloadable file. Proceed without further</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=706">00:11:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">question". And here is the output and I checked it for the letter P and it was correct that there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=712">00:11:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">were 36 instances of the letter P in the output. And look how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=715">00:11:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's proportional with the number of instances of the letter and the size of each rectangle. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=720">00:12:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that is pretty insane. Okay back to something more serious. I uploaded this file which is an image of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=726">00:12:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">a math problem. Quite a hard one as well. And you guessed it I said "solve the math problem in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=731">00:12:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">image". It then extracted the text from the image presumably using OCR and then proceeded to solve it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=738">00:12:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to get onto this in a second. It is better at math than Wolfram Alpha. I know that's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=743">00:12:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">claim but it's far less buggy. I found Wolfram Alpha crashing very frequently. Anyway here are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=749">00:12:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the two solutions and isn't that incredible. From a photo essentially it then extracts out the math</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=754">00:12:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">problem including the two square roots and then solves it. This is all within the same window of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=759">00:12:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT. No need for any other apps or extensions. Next it can do radial bar plots which I think are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=766">00:12:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really quite beautiful. I'm not saying this is the best one ever and I'm sure you could tweak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=770">00:12:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it to make it more clear and beautiful. But look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=773">00:12:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The life expectancy in the US climbing from 1800 and then it goes clockwise reaching a projected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=780">00:13:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">almost 90 by 2100. Again I'm sure you could do a far better job than me in extracting out a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=786">00:13:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">beautiful diagram. But aren't radial bar plots just beautiful to look at. Speaking of cool diagrams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=791">00:13:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">how about this. I didn't even specify which visualization to do. I uploaded the same life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=797">00:13:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">expectancy data and I just said "what are the most advanced and technical visualizations you can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=802">00:13:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">with this data".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=803">00:13:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Proceed to do them. Now honestly it picks some visualizations that I don't think are the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=807">00:13:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">advanced but nevertheless it was creative. Here is what it did. It does frequently make the mistake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=813">00:13:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of cluttering the axes and having far too many labels so that you can't see anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=818">00:13:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So scrub that one out. Not great. But what about the next few. Remember it just did this on its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=823">00:13:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">own. This is a heat map and you can see some really interesting things from this data. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=828">00:13:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">India starting with a much lower life expectancy than anyone else but gradually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=832">00:13:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">rising but still falling behind the others even in 2100. And look at China. Look how the life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=838">00:13:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">expectancy drops in the 60s and 70s. I think we all know what happened there. Compare that to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=844">00:14:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">US which is a gradual continual ascent. Actually aside from 2020 look how the shade gets a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=851">00:14:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">darker in 2020. Obviously you guys can probably work out what happened around then but then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=857">00:14:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">projections are for it to go up toward 90 by 2100. That's a beautiful and clear heat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=862">00:14:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">map that I didn't even ask for it to do. Let's look at the next one. Box plot. Do you remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=867">00:14:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">those from school? You get the upper end of the data, the highest one, the lowest one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=871">00:14:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the median, the first quartile and third quartile. And it's a great way of statistically representing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=877">00:14:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a set of data and it's done it for every 50th year starting in 1900. Obviously a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=883">00:14:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">slightly less beautiful diagram than some of the ones you've seen today.

Any insights that GPT-4 finds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=920">00:15:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">trends, medians, analyses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=922">00:15:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. You can ask it to add to the original file and then download it. Do you remember that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=928">00:15:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the original file was called Median Age Years? Well notice this file name Median Age Years with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=934">00:15:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">insights. It has created a downloadable new file with the insights included and look at some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=940">00:15:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">insights that I mean. You have the change from 1950 to 2100 and here is the average median age</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=948">00:15:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout the period and the change from 2023</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=952">00:15:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to 2100. Notice that the original file didn't have those columns. They were added by GPT-4 with code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=958">00:15:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">interpreter. And now how about data progression video files. I was honestly shocked when I saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=964">00:16:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that it could do this but I asked can you make a 256 by 256 mp4 that gradually reveals the lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=970">00:16:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">as they progress on the x-axis. This was about the median age over time. Here is what it did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=976">00:16:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And look at how the data and the chart progresses as time moves along. I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=982">00:16:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">really shocked to see this. And the line in red which is going to be labeled at the end is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=988">00:16:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">global median age. And remember it calculated that. That wasn't in the original file. Now I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=994">00:16:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not sure why it picked out these four countries. Maybe because they represent extremes. But either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=999">00:16:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">way I think the result is phenomenal. And I'm genuinely impressed that it did this even though</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1006">00:16:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I know the final result could be improved dramatically. For example far higher resolution and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1011">00:16:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe the global median age labeled from the start. And actually now that it's got to the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1016">00:16:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I can see why it did pick out these countries. Because niger did have the lowest median age in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1021">00:17:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">2100 and it looks like Puerto Rico had the highest and the fastest aging one was Albania. Next and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1028">00:17:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this is going to shock quite a few people. What about image editing. I created this image in mid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1034">00:17:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">journey version 5 and then here's what I asked. I said use OpenCV to select the foreground of this image. And look what it did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1041">00:17:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It picked out the foreground. No blue sky. Now I know it's not perfect but it's nevertheless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1047">00:17:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">impressive all within the window of ChatGPT. This does actually make me wonder if OpenAI and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1054">00:17:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT is eventually not now but in a few years going to swallow all other apps. Or maybe Google's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1060">00:17:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini. But either way one interface one website one app doing the job of all others. And by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1067">00:17:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">way of course ChatGPT is now available on iOS. But imagine you have one app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1071">00:17:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can do image editing, text to speech, video editing, everything data analysis. Not at GPT-4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1077">00:17:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">levels but GPT-6 or GPT-7 levels. If you can get every piece of information, service and application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1083">00:18:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in one interface. A bit like now people being addicted to their smartphones. Won't people be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1088">00:18:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">addicted to this one interface. Again that's not going to happen now but I'm just posing it as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1093">00:18:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">question to think over. For the moment though before anyone gets too carried away it does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1097">00:18:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">still hallucinate quite a lot. So I uploaded this image and I asked it questions about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1101">00:18:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And it answered and I was like wow it can do image recognition. It said this image appears to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1106">00:18:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">digital painting of a humanoid figure at a desk with a rather complex background. I was initially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1112">00:18:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">amazed until I realized that it probably got that from the file name. Because when I asked it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1116">00:18:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">questions it got it wrong. So I said what is on the desk. I look back there's this weird kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1123">00:18:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">microphone and a bit of paper and not much else a keyboard. And look what it said. There are multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1128">00:18:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">floating holographic displays. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1131">00:18:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">A mouse. Not really. A desk lamp. I can't see that. And then tools and devices. Now correct me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1137">00:18:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if I'm wrong but I think most of those are incorrect. Now obviously I need to do far more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1141">00:19:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">experiments to see if it actually can recognize any particular images. And maybe I'm putting it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1146">00:19:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">down too harshly. But at the moment it does seem to hallucinate if you ask it about too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1151">00:19:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">much of the detail of an image. Next you remember how one of the key weaknesses of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1155">00:19:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT-4 is that it can't really count things. Especially not characters, words etc. And even more so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1160">00:19:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it can't do division. And some of you might be thinking well with Wolfram Alpha it can do those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1165">00:19:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">things. Not quite. Here is an example of the Code Interpreter plugin essentially eating Wolfram Alpha</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1171">00:19:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">obviating it making it not obvious what the utility of it is if you've got Code Interpreter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1176">00:19:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I asked divide the number of the letter E's in this prompt by the number of the letter T's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1181">00:19:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you might think Code Interpreter can improve things by doing the character counting. But it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1186">00:19:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">can also do the division. Notice how it counted the characters correctly compared to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1190">00:19:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Wolfram Alpha and of course got the division correct as well. So if it can do advanced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1195">00:19:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">quadratics and do division and character counting etc. It does beg the question what would we use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1201">00:20:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Wolfram Alpha for that we can't use Code Interpreter for. I honestly might not know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1205">00:20:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">something that you guys know so do let me know in the comments. It also got this math question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1209">00:20:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">correct. And notice you get these beautiful math visuals that you don't get with the base version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1214">00:20:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of GPT-4. You get something more like this where the visuals aren't as clear. And notice the base version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1220">00:20:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of GPT-4 gets the question wrong. It can't do division but with Code Interpreter it gets the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1225">00:20:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">question right. Next one is a quick one. Pie chart. Nothing too special but I think it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1229">00:20:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a fairly beautiful visualization. It doesn't seem to matter how big the CSV file is that you upload.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1235">00:20:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">This next example was really quite fascinating. It was a word puzzle. I have tried this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1240">00:20:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">word puzzle on GPT-4 dozens of times. The reason I picked this puzzle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1245">00:20:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it's called a word ladder, is because it really struggles with the puzzle if the number of steps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1250">00:20:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">required is more than a certain number. Usually about five or six steps. It gave me a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1255">00:20:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting border of the limits of GPT-4's planning abilities with language. Anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1260">00:21:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it always gets it wrong. Here is a demonstration with the base model of GPT-4. You might say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1265">00:21:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">why is this wrong? But look at how it's changed from C's to Sags which is more than one letter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1272">00:21:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">change. And that's typical of the kind of errors it makes. What about with Code Interpreter? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1277">00:21:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you can probably guess the ending given that I featured it in the video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1280">00:21:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But it gets it right. I believe it draws upon a hard-coded word set. And this does point towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1286">00:21:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the kind of puzzles that I think GPT-4 with Code Interpreter will be able to solve. Things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1291">00:21:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">crosswords and Sudokus. Okay, not exactly world changing but nevertheless I think quite fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1297">00:21:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And how about Venn diagrams? The reason I picked this example is that I had to go through about 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1303">00:21:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">steps to get it to create this rather basic three-way Venn diagram. This represents the overlap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1308">00:21:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">between dogs, AI, and AI. And that's why I picked this example. And I think it's a really good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1309">00:21:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">example. And apparently all of them are loyal companions. Well, we will see about that. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1315">00:21:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">anyway, it took quite a few steps to get it right which is pretty annoying. But here's the really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1319">00:21:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting thing. Once I got it set up in the way that I like, all I had to do was say, use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1325">00:22:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">format above to create a new three-way Venn diagram. This time for mangoes, movie heroes, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8GUH0_htRM&t=1331">00:22:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">marmosets.
