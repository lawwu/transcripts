He did a good job at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk briefly about what's going on. So I'm pulling from this New York Times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">summary to talk about what's going on in this case. All right. The case in question argued</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Supreme Court last week was brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">college student who was killed in a restaurant in Paris during the terrorist attacks in November</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">2015. A lawyer for the family argued that YouTube, which is a subsidiary of Google,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bore responsibility because it had used algorithms to push Islamic State videos to interested viewers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">using information the company had collected about them. So this case is Gonzalez v. Google. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the Gonzalez family suing Google because Google owns YouTube. All right. So they're saying YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is partially responsible for our son's death. Now, the core legal issue at stake here is found,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm scrolling to find the exact text here. It's a small section, Section 230, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be very specific, Section 230(c)(1) of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The Section 230, so it's a part of U.S. law, has the following sentence in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">speaker of any information provided by another content provider." So as this New York Times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">article clarifies, what this means is it has enabled the rise of social networks like Facebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and Twitter by ensuring that the sites did not assume legal liability for every post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Section 230 was put into law in the 90s. It was actually spurred by a lawsuit that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">raised, I believe, against the early internet service provider, Prodigy, about something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">defamatory that was posted on a Prodigy bulletin board. And this lawsuit back in the 90s argued,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"You can't just say you're a passive host of information because you do moderate comments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You do take some comments down. So the fact that you didn't take this comment down meant you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Prodigy, are responsible for this information, and we are going to sue you." And in response to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we get the Section 230 that says, "No, no, no, it's not the internet service provider's fault.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if they are moderating the content, even if they are trying to get rid of some things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they still won't be held responsible for what remains." Many court cases subsequent to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">passing of the law containing Section 230 reinforce this idea that Section 230 gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">immunity from liability for internet service providers. So at the core of this case is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Gonzalez family lawyers is arguing that they should be able to pierce the Section 230 protection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because new services like YouTube, when I say new, I mean new as compared to Prodigy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as compared to 1996 internet, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, these services aren't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a repository of information like a bulletin board that's perhaps moderated.

It's an interesting daydream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What if the court came back and significantly reduced 230's protection of companies that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithmically curate or recommend information? In other words, what would happen if there was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">radical re-imagined of the internet? Would that be good or bad? That's the deep question I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to explore in today's episode. Should we consider a radically re-imagined internet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So like we always do, we're going to tackle this in three segments. Segment one, let's go a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">bit deeper. We'll go a little bit deeper on this question of what would it be like if we radically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">changed the section 230 and therefore radically changed the internet? How would it be better? How</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">would it be worse? Then we'll do some questions, five questions from you, the listeners that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant to this topic. I'm going to be a little broad there in what I count as relevant to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">topic. So the five questions will all orbit roughly around rethinking our relationship to technology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">such as the internet. So we'll have some hardcore new visions of internet questions, but also some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">more personal. How do I personally change my relationship to the internet? And a few in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">between. And then the third segment of the show, as usual, we'll shift gears and do something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting. All right. So let's deep dive into this a little bit. What would happen if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">radically changed section 230? We can start with existing visions. So people who are advocating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for changes to section 230, we can start with what their vision is for how the internet would change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we'll go forward to the vision I have in mind. Here's the thing about section 230.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">At the moment, it has opponents, so people who want to see it changed on both the American</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">political right and the American political left. I don't know how the social media companies have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">managed to do this time and again, but time and again, they have managed to alienate all sides</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of the political spectrum. It really is a case study in public relations done terribly wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's already a clamoring for changes to 230 from both the right and the left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the American political right, which I think was first, the really start to question section 230,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what they are looking for is accountability on moderation. So their concern is, you can't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">take me off of your platform, kick me off Twitter, remove or demonetize my videos on YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">without being held responsible for why. And if your reason is simply, we don't like your politics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or these particular questions are bad for a particular, let's say progressive policy that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to promote, then you should be held accountable, your major platform. So the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">really comes at it from, you can't just take stuff off the internet for no good reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You can be held liable for why you're doing that.

So this is the right's approach to section 230. They think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">giving too much cover for these companies to do whatever they want. Interestingly, there's a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">case coming to the Supreme court later this session that is getting specifically at a first amendment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">attack, a first amendment argument about whether or not services can remove individuals based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things like political beliefs. The American political left came to disliking section 230</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit more recently, and they want the opposite. They want to reduce 230 protections so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that companies can be held more responsible for what they allow to be on their services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So they want to make sure that if you publish as a Facebook or a Twitter, something that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really damaging that you can be held liable. So they want to actually be able to essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">punish interactive services for what is on their platform. The right wants to be able to punish or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">hold accountable interactive services for what they take off the platform. They're coming at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">230 from two different angles. Here's my take. Neither of these two visions of what the internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">could be like with 230 revisions, we could call them are nearly radical enough. So if you, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">look at the commentary from the right and left, they're imagining a new internet in which it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">basically like the current internet. There's a small number of massive platform monopolies through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which most people interact with each other and the information landscape. They just want each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">these two sides just wants those existing landscapes to be more friendly to their team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And this kind of makes sense. I think about who, if you're a political media figure talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this, it is in your interest for there to be these highly concentrated information platforms that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone uses, because if you have influence on, let's say Twitter, that's massive influence. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">want these platforms to be around. You want them to, because they can give you a lot of power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in the information landscape. You just want them to be more friendly to the things you care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the current visions for 230 reinterpretations coming from the American</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">political spectrum are not that interesting to me because it doesn't get to the core of what we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on the internet. So let's talk about a more radical thought experiment. As long as we're daydreaming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">let's talk about a more radical thought experiment.

We're essentially going to get rid of any implied protection for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">any type of service that does any sort of curation or recommendation of information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this vision, I'm thinking about, you know, it's okay if you're a search engine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because you're not hosting the information.

You're just running a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">servers that people can host WordPress instances on and websites, but you're doing no curation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You're doing no recommendation.

All right, so let's ask about what this would be like. So if this algorithmic internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">went away because the courts waived this one, what would be left?

I spent some time reading about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Urbit earlier today.

It has peer to peer networking built into the kernel of this operating system. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whole idea is if you're running the Urbit OS, it makes it very easy for you to directly connect to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">other people running an Urbit OS on their own machine.

So that's why I think it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">happen. Interestingly, the biggest, I won't get too much into the details here. I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">two big obstacles to this. One is of course, just getting the AR technology sufficiently advanced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That will solve, that's getting a lot better. That will solve. The biggest issue now I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is the computation. So the way you would want to imagine this is going to work is that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2320" target="_blank">00:38:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">computation, so the phone operating system or the TV operating system, the computer operating system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is running efficiently on a virtual instance in a server farm somewhere. And essentially that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">instance is just streaming over the internet to your glasses, the screen images. So all you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on yourself is a box that can accept, here's the screen that's being generated by some powerful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, program. And I just put that screen in the world. So then I don't need my personal device</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to do all the different computation. It doesn't have to actually generate the images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">from scratch itself. So if I'm playing a video game, for example, I don't need my computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">attached to my AR glasses to be calculating all those polygons. That can be in an instance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere and I'm just getting the screen captures, right? And if I have a pipeline where the screen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">can be streamed to me, then my glasses can do anything, right? Because we can have as much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">back end power as we need. The issue, I think the biggest bottleneck to this future is having enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">low enough latency and high enough bandwidth to actually stream those screens fast enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to these devices that it actually looks like a native running device. There's a whole interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">discussion of this in Matthew Ball's book, The Metaverse.

There's a Google product, for example, that does this with video games where they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">stream the screens and you don't actually have to have the video game processor local. It's hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because it takes time to send things across connections. Even the speed of light is not as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">fast as you would like it to be when you're trying to send a hundred frames a second over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">internet. You also need a lot of bandwidth. So there's some real problems that have to be solved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">there. I imagine a future in which you're basically going to have a virtual machine instance that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">follows you geographically. So it's wherever you are, it's in a data center near you. And it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like one powerful instance is doing all of your computations and sending the, it's close enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that it can actually send the screens to you fast enough.

So I think science fiction writers imagine if once we have a world with these augmented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reality glasses, that somehow we're going to be subjected to constant advertisements, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2460" target="_blank">00:41:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">floating in our world that there's like in ready player one, the Spielberg version of that book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's just all these different floating ads everywhere because we could do that.

But these consumer technology companies like Apple, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=2474" target="_blank">00:41:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">don't really care.

And so that's its own movement. It's about this one idea that people are very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3656" target="_blank">01:00:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in, that I'm trying to help people with trying to make a positive impact in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3660" target="_blank">01:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the right way to understand the deep life movement, the deep life dot com, it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when John Haidt started Heterodox University or Heterodox Academy, whatever he called it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a particular movement or organization he created about one idea that he worked on as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3675" target="_blank">01:01:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">social psychologist.

So that's the way I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3679" target="_blank">01:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">understand myself. I work on the intersection of technology and culture. I write about a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3683" target="_blank">01:01:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">different things on these issues. One of the things that has been most impactful that I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3686" target="_blank">01:01:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">worked on has been this idea of the deep life and deep life movement. So I've spun that off into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">its own organization and entity and portal and will be continuing to sort of feed and grow that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's how I understand how all these pieces fit together. I don't know if that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">complicated, Jesse. In my mind, that all makes sense. Yeah, no, I think I like it. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">structured well. And I think the deep life dot com will really be pushing, you know, I'm a slow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">productivity guy, so take our time. But slowly we're growing this slaver growing thing. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">think the new Cal Newport dot com that integrates the academic and writing portions of my life in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3721" target="_blank">01:02:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the one site. And then the deep life dot com as being the home for the podcast, the home for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">video. So that's not living on Cal Newport dot com. I think there's a lot of for me clarity in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Yeah. So I can be an academic who thinks about technology and writes academic stuff on it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3738" target="_blank">01:02:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">also writes public facing stuff on it. And then also have this this entity I created,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the deep life dot com that really helps this one movement that that came out of my work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really help that grow and help a lot of people. But the important thing, I think, is to distinguish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">my general work as a thinker from the deep life dot com.

It's not like the deep life dot com, this podcast like this is me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3766" target="_blank">01:02:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's not like this is all I do.

My academic work I'm working on now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3788" target="_blank">01:03:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is some of it's pretty technical. It's not directly related to it. So I think by having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">being able to separate these two, we can really feed the deep life as a movement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3796" target="_blank">01:03:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and help as many people as possible without muddying it up too much with, oh, and I'm giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3801" target="_blank">01:03:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this lecture at this university on digital ethics or something like they're related,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=3805" target="_blank">01:03:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but they're not all the same thing. So we'll see if that's clear.

It's at BuzzFeed. Michael Cera explained why he doesn't own a smartphone. And honestly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4272" target="_blank">01:11:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a solid explanation. Michael Cera, of course, played George Michael on the epic cult classic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4282" target="_blank">01:11:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Fox TV comedy, Arrested Development.

I made a Arrested Development reference in class. So I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4302" target="_blank">01:11:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about the need that there's, I was saying there's always points when you're doing induction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4307" target="_blank">01:11:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">problems on a, on a exam. So you always get some points for just doing the base case, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4311" target="_blank">01:11:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">easy. There's always points in the base case. And I said this, if you need to remember this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4315" target="_blank">01:11:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just sort of my version of there's always money in the banana stand, which is an Arrested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4318" target="_blank">01:11:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Development reference. Two students came up to me after class and said, I just want to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4322" target="_blank">01:12:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I really appreciated the Arrested Development reference. So even the young kids today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4327" target="_blank">01:12:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">at least some of them have come across Arrested Development.

So Michael Cera was a star of Arrested Development and has done a bunch of other stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4339" target="_blank">01:12:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">since. So this Buzzfeed article has some cool details. So let me just read a few things from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4344" target="_blank">01:12:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this article here. It all warms my heart. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4348" target="_blank">01:12:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about his latest projects, Michael explained why he's rejected modern cell phone technology and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4353" target="_blank">01:12:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">attempted to keep his private life extremely private. The reality is that Michael is not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4357" target="_blank">01:12:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">fan of too much socializing and he's completely opted out of social media. It doesn't feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4362" target="_blank">01:12:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">conscious. He said, I guess it's just something that I didn't elect to do because everyone does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4366" target="_blank">01:12:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it. It starts to feel like a big choice, but it's just not that interesting to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4370" target="_blank">01:12:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, he's so private, you won't even catch him with an iPhone or Android. His explanation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4375" target="_blank">01:12:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">makes a lot of sense. I also don't have a smartphone, he added, and that is a conscious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4379" target="_blank">01:12:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">choice because I feel a bit of fear about it, honestly, like I'd really lose control of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4385" target="_blank">01:13:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">waking life. I think that's cool. So here's the message. My good friend, Michael Cera, and I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4393" target="_blank">01:13:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not use social media. He doesn't even use a smartphone. Between the two of us, we have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4400" target="_blank">01:13:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">involved in multiple Emmy award-winning shows and cool movies. Between the two of us, we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4406" target="_blank">01:13:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actually quite famous. He won all the Emmys, he did all the movies. But I think it's cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the bigger point. When we say I need to use something, like I need to use social media,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4420" target="_blank">01:13:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to have a smartphone. What we usually really mean by need is I'm afraid that some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4426" target="_blank">01:13:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bad things might happen if I don't. And Cera gets into this farther on in this BuzzFeed article</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4431" target="_blank">01:13:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about like, yeah, there's probably roles I didn't get. There's probably some opportunities that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4436" target="_blank">01:13:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't available to me because I'm not out there with a big social media presence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4440" target="_blank">01:14:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's the thing, who cares? He has a cool life. He was involved in a cool show. He's done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4444" target="_blank">01:14:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cool plays. He's done cool movies. He continues to work. He's not a huge celebrity because he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not out there. He's not that visible. So he has his private life still relatively private.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4454" target="_blank">01:14:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't need to use these tools. He just recognized if he didn't, he might lose a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4459" target="_blank">01:14:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunities. And he said, great, what a fair price. What a fair price to pay to have a life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4464" target="_blank">01:14:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that's more under my control. That's what I like about this Michael Cera example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4468" target="_blank">01:14:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to fall into this optimization mindset of like, OK, if I'm going to be an actor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4475" target="_blank">01:14:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">how can I be the most successful possible actor in the history of the world?

How about just like I want to be a working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4482" target="_blank">01:14:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">actor and I have a cool life or I want to be a writer instead of saying I want to optimize to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4487" target="_blank">01:14:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">be the best selling author of all time.

How about just like I'm an author that sells books</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4495" target="_blank">01:14:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and people like them and it's a really cool life. You know, you don't have to optimize everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4499" target="_blank">01:14:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to be the baseball player trying to break the record for AAV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4502" target="_blank">01:15:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's contract. So that's Michael Cera. He's built a cool life without having trying to wring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4508" target="_blank">01:15:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">out every possible bit of exposure or growth. And I like that. The other thing I learned about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4516" target="_blank">01:15:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and Jesse, maybe you're more familiar with BuzzFeed, but what the hell is going on with this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4520" target="_blank">01:15:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this what BuzzFeed is? It's just like pictures with two sentences and another picture that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4524" target="_blank">01:15:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">another two sentences. I never go on BuzzFeed. My goodness. That's the other lesson I take away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4530" target="_blank">01:15:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from this. BuzzFeed kind of depresses me. See, Michael Cera can probably be probably reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4536" target="_blank">01:15:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">long New Yorker pieces because he's not distracted by his phone.

That's kind of depressing, but it's balanced out by the fact that Michael Cera is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWr3NqqL5I&t=4548" target="_blank">01:15:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the man.
