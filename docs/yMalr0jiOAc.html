Now not only is this a very manual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and time-consuming process but this limits our ability to scale and it really makes it difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for us to really provide insights into the products that we have on our platform.

Looking to the future, we're really excited about all the possibilities that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Ask David potentially brings to the table. Now to dive deeper into the technical magic behind Ask David,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll turn it over to Jane who will walk you through the notes and bolts of how we're making our vision a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reality. She might even let you in on what Ask David stands for because I promise you I didn't name this after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">myself. Thank you. Thank you, David. Ask David is a domain-specific QA agent. Let's start with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">terminology analysis. First of all, we have decades of structured data. Those are the backbones of many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">up-and-running production systems. Prior to the introduction of an agent, users have access to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">same data, but they have to navigate through different systems and manually syndicate information. An agent can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">introduce efficiency and integrated user experience. Next, we have unstructured data. As a bank, we manage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">master a vast amount of documentation including emails, meeting notes, presentations. With the rise of virtual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">meetings, we also have increasing amount of video and audio recordings. How do we make full use of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">information? The advancement of LRRM really bringing tremendous opportunity in this area. Lastly, as a research team, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">an organization that helps proprietary models and analytics, which are designed to really derive insights and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">visualization to help decision-making. Previously, it will require a human expert to conduct this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">analysis and offering white glove surveys. With the help of an agent, we can scale the insight generation and we can make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">our service available to more of our clients. Now imagine being a financial advisor in a client meeting and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">your clients suddenly bring up a fund and ask you why it's terminated. Believe me, it's actually a very loaded question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in the past, you would reach out to our investment research team, talk with real David, and then you figure out what's the status and the history of the fund and what's the reason behind it, what's the research about this fund, what's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What are similar funds, how do I curate this answer specific for this client, and you will come up with a presentation yourself manually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">With the help of an agent, we can get access to the same data, analytics, insights, and visualization right in your meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Enable the real-time decision-making. That is our vision of Ask David, and you probably guessed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">David stands for data, analytics, visualization, insights, and decision-making system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is our approach to build up Ask David, which is a multi-agent system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Starting from our supervisor agent, which acts as our trader, it talks with our end user,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">understand their intention, and try to delegate the task to one or more of sub-agents in the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The supervisor agent has access to both short-term and long-term memories so that it can customize the user experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It also knows when to invoke human-in-the-loop to ensure the highest level of accuracy and also reliability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, we have our structured data agent. It will translate natural language into either SQL queries or API calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and it will use large-language model to summarize the data on top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Our structured data is a little bit different from structured data. Usually, it requires some kind of preprocess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But as long as you save it, vectorize it, and put it into a database, we can employ a RAG agent on top to effectively derive information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Lastly, we have the analytics agent. We talked about our proprietary model and APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They are usually in the format of APIs or programming libraries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">For a simple query that can be directly answered by API calls, we'll use a React agent and use APIs as tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But for more complex queries, we'll use text-to-code generation capabilities and use human supervision for the execution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This graph is our end-to-end workflow. It's starting with a planning node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And you probably noticed there are two subgraphs over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One is a general QA flow. So for any questions, for any general questions, for example, how do I invest in gold,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you will go to the left-hand side subgraph. And if the question is regarding specific funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you will go to the right-hand side flow. Each of the flow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as you can see, are equipped with one supervisor agent and a team of specialized agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Once we retrieve the answer, you probably notice there's one node to personalize the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and another node to do the reflection check. I will explain it in detail in an example to follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole flow ends with summarization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So now, back to our client question. Why was this fund terminated?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is how our agent can handle it. So as you can see on the right-hand side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the agent answer was the fund was terminated due to a performance issue. And you can actually click</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">into the reference link to see more about the fund performance and the reason behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What really happened behind the thing? From that planning node, we start to understand this user inquiry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is related to a specific fund. So it goes to the specific fund flow. And the supervisor agent inside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">will be able to extract the fund information as a context and understand that actually the doc search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">agent is the right one to solve the problem. Once doc search agent gets that information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it starts to trigger the tools underneath to get the data from MongoDB.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once we retrieve that information, the data and information will be personalized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The same information can be presented in different ways. It depends on who is asking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, we are talking about the fund termination reason over here. A due diligence specialist may demand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a very detailed answer. And while advisor maybe just need a general answer. So this personalization node will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">tailor the answer based on the user roles. Next, we have the reflection node. It uses LM judge to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the answer we generated makes sense. If it doesn't, what do we do? We try again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the last one, the whole flow ends with summarization. In the summarization node, we do several things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We summarize the conversation, we update the memory, and we return the final answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was quite a journey working on this multi-agent application. We are very excited to share the lesson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">learned. Number one, start simple and refactor often. I know I showed you a fairly complex diagram</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier, but we didn't really focus on building that diagram from day one. So day one, if you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is a plain vanilla react agent. We try to understand how it works. And from there, we need to work on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">specialized agent on the picture tool, which actually is a rag agent, if you can see. We start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">customize the flow. But once we get very comfortable with the performance of the specialized agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we start to integrate that into our multi-agent flow in picture three with the supervisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the picture four, that's our current stats. We actually have the subgraph generated for specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of intentions. Right now, we only have two intentions, but we can scale easily with this architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I talked about fast iterations. But how do we know every iteration we're moving towards the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">direction? The answer is evaluation-driven development. So everyone knows that compared to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the traditional AI projects. Gen AI projects actually has a shorter development phase. But we do have a long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation phase. So our suggestion is to start early, think about the metrics, what kind of goal you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to achieve. As we are in financial industry, obviously accuracy is one of the most important things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And the continuous evaluation helps you gain confidence that you are improving day by day. So there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">additional tips I have over here based on our own experience of evaluation. As you can see on the screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right, so the dark blue bars over here are coming from the metrics of evaluation on our main flow. And the green</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one is actually one example of our sub-agent. So my tip number one is make sure you independently evaluate your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sub-agents. But the key for your evaluation is to find places to improve, right? These help you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out what's the weak link to improve your accuracy. Second point is it depends on how you design</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">your agents. Make sure you pick the right metrics. So if you have a summarization, you may want to check</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">whether your summarization is concise or not. So conciseness is one of the metrics you want to pick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are doing a tool call, maybe you can have the trajectory evaluation instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is a common myth. I think especially if you're a developer, you're talking about TDD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of people say, no, I just don't do that. It's a lot of work, right? But it's not the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the evaluation. You actually can start evaluation with or without ground truth. It doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There are so many metrics beyond just accuracy. And each one of them will provide you some insight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know what? Once you start doing evaluation, you will have review. Once you start doing review,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you're actually going to accumulate more for the ground truth examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Lastly, we have large language model itself as judge in combination of a human review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This automatic solution really helps us scale without adding too much burdens to our human SME to review</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">large amount of AI-generated answers. Talking about SME, our last lesson learned over here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is about human SME in the loop. When you apply a general model to a specific domain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">usually you will get less than 50% of accuracy. But you can do a quick improvement like chunking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">strategies, you can change your searching algorithms, and you can actually make proper engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that can get you to that 80% mark. From 80 to 90, we are using the workflow chains. We are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">creating the subgraphs so that we can fine tune certain kind of questions without impacting each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Between 90% and 100%, that's what we call the last mile. And the last mile is always the hardest mile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">In terms of GNI applications, it may not be achievable to get that 100% mark, right? So what do we do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So human SME in the loop is very important to us because we have billion dollars at stake and we cannot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">afford inaccuracy. In other words, Ask David still consults with real David whenever needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Go ahead. In conclusion, three takeaways for you. Iterate fast, evaluate early, keep humans in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.
