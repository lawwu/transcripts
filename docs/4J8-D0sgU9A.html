You might ask, why is that so? Well, it turns out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a panacea of frameworks, tools, models, approaches, evaluation criteria to choose from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and to effectively put together into one end-to-end pipeline. So we really hope in this talk we can go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">through the critical decision-making process in setting up enterprise agents, really touching on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the insights and key learnings we've had in building these agents, from addressing the frameworks we love,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to discussing single versus multi-agent strategies, as well as addressing some of the critical components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that are less discussed around evaluating LLM agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's start with frameworks. Now, over the past few years, there have been an increasing number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">frameworks that have come into the market from components such as Autogen, Crew AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as LangChain. Now, they all have their own benefits and disadvantages, depending on a given use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">case. But our core learning in the past year has really been to focus on three critical components,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and those are observability, right? Is it easy to debug and fix? The second is the setup cost, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how quickly can you iterate and resolve an issue, as well as build and piece together the entire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">agent you're interested in building? And then, of course, lastly is support. You know, is the framework</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">well-documented? Does it support various models and tools and functionalities?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've often viewed these frameworks under these three criteria. And generally, we tie these three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">criteria to a given use case. And more concretely, what this might look like is building large-scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprise agents often requires high levels of observability, for which we would really recommend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going native or building with LangGraph. Now, of course, the space of frameworks is a continuously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">evolving landscape. And so this is a recommendation at this point in time. But we obviously expect this to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">change as frameworks continue their support to improve observability and ease of use. And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in the same vein, what we'd recommend for quick tests and proof of concepts is frameworks like CrewAI and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Autogen. And the reason for this is that there's generally a low setup uplift with low code to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things working out of the box. And, of course, they're easy to leverage, pre-existing or pre-built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">agents and tools and orchestrate them all together in a multi-agent setting. So these are immediate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">recommendations. Of course, here at Cahere, we're continuously improving our integration support for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">these various frameworks. And we hope to continue doing the support and watching this space evolve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And in part, what we're particularly excited about is seeing a sliding scale spectrum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">across these various frameworks for different use cases. Okay. Now, once you decide on which framework</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to use, of course, you need to decide on the approach or the strategy that you plan to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this framework in, right? Do you plan to use single agent? Do you plan to use multi-agent? Will you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">human-in-the-loop feedback? Our core recommendation, and this is insights that have come from a number of use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">cases, is always start simple. A single LLM with a handful of tools can often go a long way. But more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">importantly, being very diligent about the tool specifications really helps uplift performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we found is, you know, we worked with one client, and one of their asks was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, we've got a long list of APIs. And these API specifications could take in up to 10 to 15 different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters. And could you get a model to successfully run tool calls for these tasks? What we've really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">found is, to achieve the performance gains that they were trying to achieve, we needed to really simplify the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">entire approach. We needed clear descriptions with very sharp examples on how to call the tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as providing and simplifying the input types. So converting complex nested dictionaries into list,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">stir, or full types. Now, in addition to these learnings, we've also found that providing a clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">instruction list, which is short, pithy, and to the point goes a much longer way than providing a long set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of instructions that can actually provide confusion to the model and induce potential hallucinations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">long streams of chat history, in other words, back and forth conversations between the user and chatbot that go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">over 20 turns, for example, and induce certain hallucinations. And this is true across a whole host of models and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">frameworks. To handle that particular problem, we really recommend caching. Essentially caching that history</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and retrieving it whenever it is particularly relevant to a new user query can actually help your LLM agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">achieve better performance through time. And we'll get to what we mean by performance in some later slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, indeed, there are frameworks such as Autogen that support multi-agent style orchestration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, in multi-agent, obviously in the multi-agent setting, it's a collection of simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">agents tied together. And they have a routing model that decides which sub-agent to go to and retrieve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">information from. And there's been a growing interest in the industry to build multi-agents that are very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">robust and versatile. Of course, this requires a good routing model, good reasoning model, and of course, sub-agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that are well-constrained. And so, what we've learned for the router is that it should really contain a list of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">tools with clear descriptions. That always holds. But it should also contain a sharp set of routing instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that can encompass potential edge cases, right? So, if you're trying to route information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">from the router to a sub-agent, and then back to another agent, providing that type of clarity and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">instruction to the model can really help it decide what it should do at each stage, rather than it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">autonomously and continuously trying to attempt things that may not be the most optimal path to getting to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">final answer. Of course, we also recommend that for sub-agents, they should be constrained to performing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">independent tasks with a small set of tools to return the final answer, right? Each sub-agent should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">decomposed into a specific task that it should handle. So, those are key insights we've had from building both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">simple and multi-agents in the enterprise setting. And now, the most important bit, right? We've glossed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">over the fact that agents can act quite autonomously to achieve final results, but we do think safety is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">paramount to any scalable real-world application, right? And here are some examples. If we decide to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a Gmail agent, for example, we may want to request permission prior to sending emails,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We might want the user to get a pop-up that says, "Hey, are you okay with me sending this email?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We don't want random emails to be sent. And this might be true in the HR support bot setting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as in the financial analysis agent setting. What we've learned essentially is that incorporating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">human-in-the-loop is thus, like, really critical for business applications. And what's really nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">about it is that you can codify a set of rules under which human-in-the-loop is triggered, right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">under various criteria, we can force human-in-the-loop to be triggered. And typically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this can happen before or right prior, like, right before a tool is called. But it could also happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right after a tool call is made, especially if the execution output, for example, may contain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">various parts of information that you may not want to process completely. Okay, great. So we've addressed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">frameworks. We've addressed various approaches we've explored and the insights we've gained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, importantly, we need to discuss evaluation. How are we going to assess the performance of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">agent that we've built? So, you know, what really makes a successful agent is a lot of things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot of moving pieces that need to come together for it to be successful. Essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the model needs to make the right tool call at the right time. The model needs to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially receive executed tool results and reason on top of it. And it needs to make tool calls very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">succinctly and accurately passing the right input parameters. And it needs to have the ability to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">course correct even when things are going wrong, right? So what's quite interesting here is for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">final product or the end user, the only thing that particularly matters to them is the final product or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the final answer they get from the agent. But what matters most to, I think, developers as they're debugging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and understanding how the LLM is making decisions is not just the final output, but all the intermediate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">stages that go into getting to the final answer. And so we have an example here where, for example, a user may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ask a model to provide information about weather in New York City on February 5th. Ideally, the model should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">decide to use a specific tool, pass in the right parameters, get a returned set of results from those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">tools and reason over the return response to provide a final output, which is New York City will be mostly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sunny, sunny, etc. Now, as you can see, there are a number of intermediate stages that take place to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">get to the final response. And typically, what we do here at Cohere is we build a golden set of ground truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">user queries, expected function calls, expected parameter inputs, expected outputs, as well as expected final</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">response. The nice thing about doing this and building this evaluation set is that we can run this large corpus of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluations through our agentic framework and assess any critical points of failure or where we think the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">may be going wrong. And this makes debugging particularly easy from an evaluation standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you might be asking why I've mentioned debugging and observability as very important. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it turns out that autonomous LLM agents do indeed have a tendency to fail, as most developers know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we at Cohere are continuously exploring various failure mitigation strategies, right? And what we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">really come down to is this table of insights. It's really short and simple, but it's essentially that if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">working with failures at a low severity or a low failure rate, what we've found is actually prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering can go a really long way to essentially just improving the quality of the tool API specs or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">tool inputs can really help uplift the final mile on performance gaps. However, if you do see a tool type failure or model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucinating on specific tasks in the 10 to 20% range, what we've really found is actually building a targeted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">annotation data set is really useful for closing the gap. And lastly, and perhaps most critically, is if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are seeing a high failure rate, particularly if an API is very difficult to call or API names are very similar and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to disambiguate between them, actually building a larger corpus using synthetic data and fine tuning is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy that we employ here at Cohere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've talked to you about frameworks, approaches,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">various evaluation criteria and failure mitigation strategies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's quite nice here is that at Cohere, we're constantly working on developing and improving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">these various criteria. And one way in which we do this is we're continuously improving the base model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">performance at tool calling. And as you can see here, we're particularly performant on BFCL v3,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a standard evaluation criteria for single and multi-hop tool calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a really highly performant 7b model, as there is a continued interest for really lightweight tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">calling models. In addition to this, we're also codifying the whole host of insights. So in essence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we're bringing together the learnings from the frameworks, approaches and deployment, deploying these models in the wild</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for agentic applications into a single product, a product we've termed north.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And essentially, it's a single container deployment that has access to RAG, has access to various vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">DBs and search capacities, but also has connectivity to various applications of interest, including Gmail,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Outlook, Drive and Slack, to name a few. So you can think of North as a one-stop shop for using and building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic applications as a single package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I even have a demo for you here from North, and this is it in motion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Essentially, it's connected to Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, and G Drive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is asked about opportunities in Salesforce.

It's able to pull the relevant document of interest and essentially provide a breakdown of both the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning chain, the tools that were called and the tool outputs, which is pretty nice if you're hoping to debug</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and assess what the model is doing under the hood.

And you can also update specific tool calling capacities. For example, you could ask the model to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">correct which tool call was used. And ideally, what the model does is it updates its reasoning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and the package decides to then eventually use Gmail and return the relevant information. So I hope this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is an insightful talk and hopefully you've taken away some learnings about deploying enterprise LLM agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8-D0sgU9A&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that we found particularly useful and have packaged into North.
