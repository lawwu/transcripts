I'm Dan Delamarski. I'm a product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">engineer at Microsoft and member of the MCP steering committee.

I work in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Azure API Management at Microsoft. And the both of us are part of an MCP squad at Microsoft. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">guess that's why we are here. Yeah. So we're again talking about protected MCP servers. And why is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">this even important? Why is this even a topic? Well, the thing is, when we talk about MCP servers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and MCP servers that folks connect to their whatever clients, whether it's cloud desktop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">VS Code, VS, not every server should be open because there's a bunch of different APIs that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">might require authorization. They're protected. So naturally, your MCP server needs to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">do the same. It is super important for remote MCP servers because anybody can access them. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if the servers are open to the broad internet and not behind a VPN. But it's not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant for local servers. And mainly because locally, you can do a bunch of stuff already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's just a binary. And we'll get to that in a second. Now, if you're building MCP servers and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">remote MCP servers specifically, one of the things that you're connecting to are likely third-party</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">APIs, whether it's your own or somebody else's. And that API requires user context. That API needs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">know who's invoking it because different customers have different permissions. You might have different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">admin policies. So while your API does control through the help of an identity provider as to who actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">has access, this needs to be somehow exposed to the MCP layer. And, of course, your API will act</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">differently depending on the credentials that you give it. If I'm an admin, I get access to a certain set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">tools. If I'm somebody that's just a contributor, I get access to a bunch of different tools. Now, all these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">considered, one of the questions I get asked a lot is like, "Well, okay, this is all great for remote, but why not local?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the story for authorization for local servers?" And the answer is kind of simple. Local servers are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">binaries on the box. They're binaries that run within the context of whatever machine you have. That means that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that they can do auth in any way you can possibly have. Like, it doesn't need to be auth. You can have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">credentials that are secrets. You can have certificates. You can have pass keys that are bound to whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">credential you have on the box. Like, it's just like you don't have any constraints whatsoever. That means that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">any APIs you connect to can also be done in any way with any of the off-the-shelf libraries. There is, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">special cases here if you do things like remote desktop and all sorts of kind of multi-user scenarios</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">on VMs. But that's kind of out of scope for MCP. That's something that we left to implementers. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">remote servers. Let's get back to that. So, one of the things that if you've browsed kind of the MCP specs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you might know that we have two different specifications. There's one that is stable, that is March 26th,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's one that is draft, that we worked very closely with a bunch of security experts to refine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for the previous specification, the one that is currently marked as stable, MCP required people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that are building MCP servers to essentially spin up their own authorization server. That means you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">building your own token factory. So, if you want to issue tokens to an MCP client to authorize users,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you're the one that has to craft those tokens and manage them and refresh them and assign them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Very complicated. It required people to actually be OAuth experts. Like, if you want to build an MCP</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">server that does OAuth, you need to understand how OAuth works end-to-end, including to the point of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">minting those tokens, which is very complicated. So, the draft spec that we worked with Anthropic and a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of security experts to refine actually does this clean separation between the server, the MCP server,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">which we call the resource server, and the authorization server. So, things like token</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">minting and managing token lifetime actually is not done by the MCP server anymore. It's done by whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">authorization server you're using. So, if you're using Okta, Auth0, EntryID, it doesn't really matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just plug it into your MCP server and it's going to work with the clients that those servers can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">connect to. And the spec, by the way, is going to be stable very soon. Now, I want to hand it off to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Juliet to talk about the fact that... Not every developer wants to be a security expert,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like, we've seen the current draft, now the new one that's about to go live into production,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but not everyone, we have some exceptions here, who do want to become security experts. You actually want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to focus on building the remote MCP server, right? You want to solve a real problem. So, this is why the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">authorization spec, and that's why Dan, why a bunch of people at Microsoft, we partnered with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Anthropic in a security committee to get this new auth spec out there. So, let's see if I paid attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some of the core things that's going to change now moving forward? First of all, no need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">implement the authorization servers anymore. So, that means we can now just rather than implementing it from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">scratch, we can actually attend it or append it to our server overall. We can use the standard ways we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">only need to reference metadata that are going to point to our authorization servers. And there, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">where we're going to get the token. And then on server side, you're going to have the token, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">information here. And all of this are still going to continue standard OAuth 2.0. So, we can actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">as developers, we can rely on all of the libraries that are already out there, all of the services. So, it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">make our lives a lot, a lot easier. What does this also include on client side? So, on client side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">they are now, in a way, responsible for the end-to-end token dance. So, this means if the authorization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">code comes in, we can validate it or the client validates, first of all, is the token, has it been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">acquired successfully? And then on server, it's going to pass it through to the server. And on server side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">which is still very important, you're going to have to make sure if it's been validated correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, of course, on server side, we have to implement the metadata, which I previously just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">talked about. So, again, a lot of enhancements now moving forward with the new spec.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Saving effort. Saving keystrokes. As developers, they don't need to write a lot of security code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">because, again, the risk is higher. Exactly. If you're not a security expert and you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">implementing security code, what are the chances that you're going to get it right on the first shot?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">A hundred percent. And you can start relying on these off-shelf identity providers like Microsoft,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Entra, Okta. So, all of these things. And you, it's just going to be less work for the developer. But,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah. How does it work in practice? Yeah. So, let's talk about, we talked about the new spec. And for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">folks that might be a little confused, like what the heck is the new spec and how exactly it works?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in a new spec, there's a very clear separation of interaction between the MCP client, MCP server,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and the authorization server.

Before I'm going to do something with it, let's just check on Azure API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">management side if all of the things have been implemented correctly, because what we should see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">now in my APIs tab is we should see the endpoint to my remote MCP server, which is the MCP API, and also the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">endpoint that's going to help us handle OAuth. And of course, while the spec evolves, we are also going to evolve the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">samples and all of it that comes with it. So let's test it. I'm going to start MCP inspector here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's open MCP inspector and provide the URL endpoint. So once I connect, now what I should see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is if I click the connect button here, this is going to pop up my content page, right? So it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">show the application name. It's going to make sure that I'm providing the right content. I'm going to allow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">access to it. The first time I'm doing it, I also have to provide the right permissions. So I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to accept this here. And once I'm back, now you can see I'm actually connected. And now I'm going to list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the tools. And as we talked about it, I currently just have three tools implemented here. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">VS Code. How does it work actually now in VS Code, for example? VS Code has MCP support as well. I'm just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">provide the end point. And I'm going to find a name for my MCP remote server here, which let's call it AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">engineer. And it's going to add it to my user settings. And immediately it's going to start running it. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">can see now in VS Code, because they now also support OAuth, they're going to pop up the window. They're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">show a notification about, hey, let's authenticate towards it. I'm going to open it. And we're going to see the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">content page, right? This time with VS Code, different application name here, where we are again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to provide our M content, we're going to allow it. And now back, I'm authorized, I'm allowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to use it in VS Code Insider. So once that's done, you saw now I have access to the three tools here in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">VS Code. So let's test this, what it's going to do in Copilot Studio, GitHub Copilot. And so first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to select and see, perfect, it was able to select my tools, and it's able to detect these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And now once I start interacting, I have my text prompt here, and just kind of do the hello worlds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and very simple example, and GitHub Copilot is now going to run it, it's going to detect the tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">because I've been authenticated, it's going to run it, and hopefully successfully, perfect. And now we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">also double check. So if I open the tool calling here, I can see that the output of Hello, I'm an MCP</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">tool has been successfully provided. And something new, and I know the world is spinning very, very fast. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">as being part of Azure API management, we want to make it easier as well. So we know the similarities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">between MCP servers and APIs. So one of the latest announcements that we have done is, you can now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">also start transforming your REST APIs into remote MCP servers using our tools, using our platform here. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you can configure your already existing endpoint, REST endpoints, into tools that you want to expose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to get like the VS code. And we're going to do this all with our platform, because we want to make it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">easier for enterprise customers, but also developers to get started with this. So here in my use case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I just copied the endpoint that was provided by me by API management, I'm going to hit start and running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, always make sure to implement auth. And that's the beauty about our platform. You can use it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for securing it, but also for hosting in this case. And now I'm able to also just immediately call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's just check if GitHub Copilot was able to detect the MCP server here. Perfect. You can see it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right under my service AI engineering one. I'm seeing the three tools that is all based on my REST API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">in VS code. And now I'm ready to go and interact with it in VS code right here. With this being said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of things are changing in this space. Any good words for the people out there who want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">get started with remote MCP server then? Yeah. So there's links on the screen that you can go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the specification documents that you can learn more about how MCP auth works. We also have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a document that we partnered with Anthropic on. It's called security best practices that outline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the best practices you should be adopting in your MCP service. You want to make sure that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">not pawned. Very, very important. And then I'll also mention that starting with VS code insiders,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we do support the new authorization spec. So you should check it out, download it, install it, give us your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback. And if anything doesn't work, we have Harold at this conference who can help you debug it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHBGhUKAM-w&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So thank you, folks. It's great. Stop by at the booth.</span></div></div></body></html>
