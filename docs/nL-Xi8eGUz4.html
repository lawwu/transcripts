So I have three ideas I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">present. The first idea I'm going to actually pull from an article I wrote in 2011. So this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">classic essay from my newsletter blog. It was very popular at the time, but it has a seed that I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to plant here because it's going to help grow into my bigger point. So for those who are watching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you will see this on the screen now. And I should say, if you're listening to this podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this is episode 285. So just go to the deep life.com/listen, find episode 285,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can get the video. All right. So here's the article. It's called,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're busy, you're doing something wrong. The surprisingly relaxed lives of elite achievers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this article is getting into what is now a over-cited, over-referenced, over-simplified study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from the journal Psychological Review that at the time when I was writing this was still new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and still interesting. This was a study where they looked at violin, professional violin players.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They looked at their training habits. If this sounds familiar, it's because Malcolm Gladwell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wrote about it in Outliers. It was one of the canonical examples about the reality of deliberate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">practice. Deliberate practice being the main way that people get better at demanding skills. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have to practice in a way that's deliberately designed to stretch their abilities past where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they're comfortable. So in the study, they're watching how these elite musicians actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">practice. All right. So I have a few bolded lines from this article I'm going to read now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. First line, the time diaries reveal that both groups spent on average the same number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of hours on music per week. So this is looking at elite musicians and good, but not elite musicians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and comparing them. The elite players were spending almost, I see, the elite players were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">spending almost three times more hours than the average players on deliberate practice. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the setup. Average players, elite players practice a lot. The elite players do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">almost entirely deliberate practice. So that means they're not just playing stuff they already know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They're specifically doing exercises to get them better. So they're, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">taking a section of song that they can't quite play full speed and increasing the speed they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">practicing at to be a little bit more than where they're comfortable to sort of stretch their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ability. All right. The average players, they discovered, spread their work throughout the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The elite players, by contrast, consolidated their work into two well-defined periods. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">elite player slept an hour more per night than the average players. The elite players were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">significantly more relaxed than the average players. So this is interesting. The elite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">players do really hard practice, but not, they don't do the other stuff. They also don't practice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all day. They consolidate their practice into two concentrated chunks. And outside of that practice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they were more relaxed and had more sleep than the average players. So I'm going to read here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">my summary. So I said, this provides, this study provides, empirical evidence that there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">difference between hard work and hard to do work. Hard work is deliberate practice. It's not fun</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">while you're doing it, but you don't have to do too much of it in any one given day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Hard to do work, by contrast, is draining. It has you running around all day in a state of false</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">busyness that leaves you just like the average players from the study, feeling tired and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">stressed. I then conclude if your goal is to build a remarkable life, then busyness and exhaustion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">should be your enemy. All right. So this is really interesting. Like what we're finding here is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">idea that what it takes to get good at something, really good at something is hard, but not hard to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">do. It's hard in the moment, but there's only so much of it you can do per day. And what happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with the rest of your time is irrelevant to whether you become really good. The three to four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">hours that these professional musicians practice every day, that's it. That's what's important for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">them. There's not more they can do. That's about the limit. So the rest of that day is free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So getting good, getting really good can be unrelated to being busy. And at the highest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">levels, like these elite musicians, busyness actually gets in the way of getting good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because it distracts you from the practice activities that matter. It exhausts you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">takes away energy that you could later put into the actual activities that are going to make you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">better. All right. So what's my second idea here? Building on that, I'm going to say rare skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">fuel remarkability. So what I mean by that is, OK, why get really good at something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, getting really good at something gives you leverage over your professional life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It gives you options and opportunities. It is the primary fuel you have for crafting your life to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">more remarkable. And my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, which actually came out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">soon after that article we just read, right? So these ideas are actually replicated in my book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So Good They Can't Ignore You. In that book, I introduced this term called career capital</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that captures this reality.

It's part of the magic of weekly planning is not just finding time for big objectives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but also making time for big objectives.

That's a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">type of thinking.

So if you say, "Look, I work from nine to four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and I have to make it fit.

So it just depends on how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">want to do that.

"With respect to slow productivity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">should I, as a grad student, perform my limited amount of tasks sequentially or spend every day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">doing new research for a couple hours?

So as a grad student, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">research every day.

And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3625" target="_blank">01:00:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I have books from there covering every decade up until our current moment in my own books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so early in this article, I actually go through each decade and I look at all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">books and I say, OK, here's the motivating question. We've been looking at this question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of how to manage your time as a professional since 1959 or before. Why don't we have it figured out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Why isn't there just this is the right way to do it?

And if we look at the advice in 1959, it looks different than the advice that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3661" target="_blank">01:01:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Peter Drucker gives in 1967, which looks different than the advice that Edwin Bliss gives in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">70s, which is different than the advice that Stephen Covey gives in the 80s and 90s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is quite different than the advice that Alan, David Allen gives in the early 2000s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3674" target="_blank">01:01:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the demands of work and our relationship with work keeps changing.

It's a space age optimism. Yeah, you can optimize how you work. Of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3689" target="_blank">01:01:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">let's get data.

Jump ahead to the 1970s and the book, Edwin C.

But then by the 80s, where we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">hypercapitalism and navel gazing, self-actualization, we get Stephen Covey that's like, no, no, no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">here's what we're going to do.

But then you jump to David Allen, Getting Things Done, 2001.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And suddenly you have a reversal. All of that self-actualization ambition is gone again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because what's happening in the world when Allen's writing this book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">network computers in the office, email, and the explosion in work volume and distraction that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">has just begun.

We just want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3778" target="_blank">01:02:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to automate the hell out of work so that we can just find some mental peace.

Let's just have a mind like water</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3796" target="_blank">01:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">moments of zen. He's responding to the issues of the time. So then the piece says, what are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">issues of our current time? And I would say in the pandemic and pandemic aftermath, too much to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">nihilism about our work, like what's all this busyness for, and communication overload are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">defining features. And I say, so what's the right advice for right now? And then I give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3819" target="_blank">01:03:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">classic Cal Newport advice, right? So if you want to see classic Cal Newport advice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Trojan horsed into the New Yorker, you will find that in this article,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3828" target="_blank">01:03:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I talk about structured task systems, Trello boards with roles and statuses and columns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3835" target="_blank">01:03:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I talk about multi-scale planning, daily, weekly, quarterly, or strategic, whatever you want to call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And I talk about communication rules, office hours, for example, things you can put in place,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3847" target="_blank">01:04:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">reverse meetings, things you can put in place to take the interactions you have to do in your job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and prevent them from unfolding in these asynchronous back and forth all day long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-Xi8eGUz4&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like the core gospel of Cal Newport.
