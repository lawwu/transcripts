Not once, ever. And yet they spend literally hours per week doing it. When I ask them what is your rich life, they will always say things like spending more time with my family, traveling, new experiences, just going out with my partner and going out for a date night.</p><p>One of the, I think, core principles here is to really get honest about what your rich life is. Your rich life does not have to be what mine is. In fact, it never will be. Ours are going to be completely different. That's how it should be. But then once you know what your rich life is in crystal clear clarity, you ask yourself the questions, get your partner involved.</p><p>Then you look at what you're actually spending your time and money on. Wait a second. Am I actually aligned with what my vision is? You know, we claim we want to travel, but the last time we traveled was like six years ago. What's going on here? We claim we want to be more in touch with our family, but when was the last time we actually spent money and time seeing them?</p></div></div></body></html>
