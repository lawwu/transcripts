If you, as a random citizen, want to buy one share of Apple stock directly on an exchange, it'll cost you tens of millions of dollars in a year to get set up to be able to do that.</p><p>You got to get like a physical COLO, maybe? You know, you have to like have market data agreements with these companies. You have to think about the SIP and about the NBBO and whether you're even allowed to lift on NASDAQ right then. You have to build technological infrastructure to do it.</p><p>But all of that comes after you get a bank account. And let's even talk about that stuff. Getting a bank account that's going to work in finance is really hard. I've probably spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of my life trying to open bank accounts. And one of the things at early Alameda that was really crucial to our ability to make money was having someone very senior spend hours per day in a physical bank branch, manually instructing wire transfers.</p><p>And if we didn't do that, we wouldn't have been able to do the trade.</p></div></div></body></html>
