back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We used to do index conferences 20 years ago where you were on panels as the head of index research and development at Russell, and I was the moderator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had people like David Blitzer from S&P and Sanjay Ayers from Morningstar, all of the index creators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we discussed the creation and management of original traditional indexes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">which you were very much involved in even back in the 1980s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So could you tell us a little bit about your background and how did you end up at Morningstar back in 2020?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, just to tie into your comments, I think clearly this has been a great industry to be a part of for the majority of my career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the rising tide that has floated many boats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I feel very fortunate to have been able to be part of what was once, you know, a sleepy backwater, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I can talk about, you know, what indexes really was back in the early days, but it really has come to dominate the investment management landscape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually started at what's now called Russell Investments is much more known as an investment manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I started in 1984, Russell was the preeminent consultant to basically institutional pension plans around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, ERISA had just passed, I think, in the late 70s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there was quite a bit of science developing around the institutional asset management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Just for clarity, could you tell us what ERISA is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so ERISA stands for the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a U.S. regulation that basically established the concept of a fiduciary, the notion that a fiduciary must only operate in the best interest of a beneficiary of some sort of, in this case, pension plan or other sort of investment vehicle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So ERISA really established the need to have more of a science and a deliberate process around investment management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, I spent a number of years at Russell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I also worked at FactSet for some time, so I was able to dive into the software world, really helping asset managers pick stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I definitely worked on the active side as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But then, as you mentioned, in the early 2000s, you know, basically went back to Russell, got back into the index business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Russell went through an acquisition by FTSE, so it became FTSE Russell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I basically continued on in a capacity basically managing product development, product management, research, and then ultimately came to work at Morningstar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So in about four years ago, I actually joined a number of my former Russell colleagues at Morningstar, and I'm right now the head of the product and research team for Morningstar Indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I understand you have 40 years in the business this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, in October of this year, I will celebrate 40 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if you knew how old I was, you could do the math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually started at Russell when I was in college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It was basically just a part-time job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I was looking for work to help pay the bills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I got a job in the performance measurement group, basically keying in data and doing a variety of activities in what was largely the back office of Russell as a consultant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's great to have you on the podcast because we're trying to get a view of where indexes began, how they evolved, what is involved in the construction of indexes, of a good index, the different types of indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe it's important to do this conversation about indexes and index methodology in the early years and the evolution of it because more than 50% of the money now in mutual funds and ETFs is passively invested in indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a huge industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, when we started out, it was less than 3%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's more than 50%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that it's important that we go over what makes a good index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">What are we looking for in a good index?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that is the underlying foundation for what the fund is trying to replicate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a big difference between the index and sometimes the index fund because one of them is theoretical and the other one actually has to be created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is some cooperation between the index providers and the fund providers to make that happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll get into some of that in a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's go back way, way back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The first, you could call it an index, was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was created in 1896 by Charles Dow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it had just 12 stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Why don't you tell us a little bit about that market indicator?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think at the time, the goal was really to try to get some sense of how is the U.S. market doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And even more specifically, it's interesting, those were actually more sector-oriented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">What we would think of as sector-oriented indexes, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You had the industrials, you had, I think, the transports, the utilities, and I think financials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So ultimately, it was interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They were really more sector-based.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But obviously, the industrial average is the one that was the forebearer of what we now see as the DJIA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the other themes here throughout the history of indexes is technology, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the time, you didn't have computers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Charles Dow computed the index on pencil and paper, collect prices from the companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had to do all the calculations with pencil and paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was, again, the first instance where we were now able to get an overall sense of how are U.S. stocks behaving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Dow Jones averages were price-weighted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So it didn't matter how big the companies were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What really mattered, and still does today, is what is the price of the stock?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So a stock that had a higher price, let's say $50 a share, that went up 10%, that went up 5 points, versus a stock that was at $10 a share, that went up 10%, and only went up 1 point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though both stocks went up 10%, the one that went up 5 points counts more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of archaic, but it worked at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, if you think about it, the implication there, it was the way you would have constructed that in actual portfolios, it implies that you had the same number of shares in each company is how you achieve what we would call a price-weighted index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so obviously the problem there is shares are somewhat arbitrary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If a company is worth $1,000, you can issue 10 shares at 100 or 100 shares at 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So using shares as a weighting mechanism, you could argue, is somewhat arbitrary, doesn't really accurately reflect the economic reality of how big companies are, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And to your point, that will have an impact on how accurate the performance is of the index that you're getting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, as outdated as that methodology is, it's still quoted in the media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing that the media quotes, even Bloomberg, is the Dow, the Dow, the Dow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it's a universally known measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that is probably one of its biggest strengths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's reported on most newscasts every day in all the newspapers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Even in the index industry, as vendors, we try to chastise people for using competitor indexes in any of our conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet we all know where the Dow is, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If I asked you what level was the Morningstar large cap index at yesterday, I don't even know, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I should admit that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But generally, people know if I tell you the Dow is at $35,000, you kind of know what that means relative to history, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's this sort of universal constant that we all can reference around the world, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the dominance of the Dow lasted a long time because, again, technology didn't allow anything to take its place until the first price-weighted index was created by the Cowles Commission for Research and Economics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And Alfred Cowles created this index in 1938, which was merged with Danden and Poor's data in 1957.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was the basis of the S&P 500 index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If I recall correctly, it was only the S&P 200, but then it became the S&P 500.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was quite a different index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And as always, you know, if people want to sort of challenge you on your dates, recognize that in some cases there were precursors, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there may have been other sorts of things going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, what we all sort of acknowledge as the real beginning of the S&P 500 was, for purposes of comparing, you know, over time, was in 1957.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">What really made the S&P different than the Dow, maybe a couple things, is it was clearly more broadly representative of the U.S. market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So it definitely captured more than just the industrials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it would have been more representative of all the various sectors in the U.S. economy at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also it was capitalization weighted, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So even before you had all this academic theory, which talked about why you might want to hold stocks in proportion to their market capitalization, which is shares times price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The S&P started to do that, you know, at that early date.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And about 25 years later, Frank Russell came in the picture with the broader Russell 3000 that covered 3000 stocks and then began slicing and dicing that into the Russell 1000 large cap, 2000 small cap, and later on value and growth indices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You were there just about that time when this evolution took place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first set of Russell indexes were launched in 1984.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">As you mentioned, that was the broad market Russell 3000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The growth and value indexes came in the late 80s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And really what was going on there is we talked about the Dow and then even the S&P 500 really were designed more to sort of reflect the U.S. market, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about the U.S. stock market, U.S. equity as an asset class, they were what we would call an asset class proxy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the S&P 500 was still just an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It was sampling from all the companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't represent all the companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But really the goal of the Russell 3000 was to take that to the next level and basically hold just about all investable companies in the U.S. market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It was less about being a sample index and really being more of a comprehensive capture of the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was happening at the time is Russell was heavily engaged in manager research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about, you know, this practice continues today, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">People that really believe in active management are, you know, first you have to find good active managers who you believe can pick stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so typically the way a manager research team does that is they have to compare those managers to a benchmark, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all relative to a benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing that was happening back in that day is traditionally a lot of these large institutional pension plans were generally run by the banks as just these big sort of typically balanced funds and you had this big equity component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But what you saw is, you know, this is also sort of the evolution of the asset management industry where you now started to have asset managers, you know, sort of distinct organizations outside of the bank, trust departments, and they started to specialize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the real key here was what Russell was observing in their manager research function is asset managers weren't just buying the entire market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Some managers were starting to buy large stocks, growth stocks, value stocks, so if you had to think about a chicken and egg scenario, the chicken was what they called manager universes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The peer groups of managers were being established by the manager research teams, and then what you found is you needed a good benchmark to sort of represent that peer group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So as Russell was doing its manager research comparing, one of the things I recognized is you can't use the S&P 500 for all of these managers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the S&P 500 might have worked in the large cap space, but now you have managers investing in small companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, coincidentally, if you look at performance of small companies, it got really bad in the mid-80s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So when the Russell 2000 was launched, you know, small cap managers wanted a more fair benchmark, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They looked really bad when you compared them to the S&P 500.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So having a better benchmark actually enabled them to, you know, not lose a lot of business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it really was the launch of the Russell indexes was really based on coming up with better benchmarks to compare active managers to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">In summary, the Dow Jones was created more of as a price indicator, so you could tell the general direction of prices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The S&P 500 came along, it was more robust, it was used more as a valuation indicator for the market, and also began to be used as an economic indicator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=852"

index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was Russell who came in with the idea of benchmarking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Where let's look at the entire market, or as much of it as we can, 3,000 stocks at that particular time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And use this in ways, and slice it and dice it, if you don't mind me using that term, to what the asset managers were doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">so we can create good benchmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And with that in mind, AMER at the time, which is now the CFA Institute, was watching all of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was a member of AMER since the early 1990s, and there really wasn't any rules or structure to, well, what is a good benchmark?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And Larry Siegel, who I had on this podcast, who is now the research director of the Research Foundation of the CFA Institute,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">he wrote a book called Benchmarks and Investment Management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was published back in 2003, and it listed out what makes a good benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have to have that list in front of me, and I'll go over it real quickly here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, the number one thing is it has to have a simplicity and an objective selection criteria,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">where a clear set of rules, how this benchmark is being created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing is it needs to be relevant, relevant to the investors, and that's what Russell was trying to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You were looking at it saying, well, you're a small cap, let's have a relevant index that's relevant to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It has to be comprehensive, so it has to cover all of the stocks that are in that category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It had to be easily replicated so that other people can pick up the rules-based methodology and replicate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It had to be stable, so not a lot of turnover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there had to be no barriers of entry, like there were no illiquid securities, and they were eliminated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, there was a last one called expenses, which were if carrying these stocks for some reason had expenses that had to be factored into the performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyway, there was a set of rules that were created, and it seemed to stand the test of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">because the index conferences that I went to in the early 2000s, everyone was talking about this set of rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you remember that time period?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I remember because those became codified, I think, in the CFA curriculum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, and the candidates were tested on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I want to focus in on, Dov, indexes must be rules-based.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you give us more insight as to what rules-based means?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If I would summarize sort of all those rules, the whole point is if you're going to be trying to assess an active manager's skill from just luck or being in the right place at the right time, the benchmark had to be fair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what these are really as principles of what does it mean to be a fair benchmark, it implies that there's a passive alternative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So that if you decided that you weren't willing to take a risk on active management or didn't want to pay the fees, that you had a choice to do something that required less information at a lower cost, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The passive alternative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of those characteristics were sort of summarized that, in theory, an investor should be able to say, you know something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think active management works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to pay the fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I can invest in something else, even if it's in theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The benchmark at this point was still a theoretical portfolio, but it should exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole concept of being rules-based was I should know in advance how the stocks in this index are going to be constructed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">As you said, in theory, it should be able to be replicated if I wanted to invest in those stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It needs to be transparent as part of understanding all of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Those rules need to be published.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the whole point is there should be little to no subjectivity or discretion on behalf of the person managing this list of stocks, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the whole concept that persists to this day is there may be a lot of insight that's used to construct the rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But once those rules are put in place and published for everybody, that's what's followed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You have certainty in terms of we know how the index is going to be constructed and maintained over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the whole point about being rules-based.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if I recall, when the Russell 1000 and the Russell 2000, which is the Russell 3000, basically split between large cap and small cap, it was just a benchmark at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't a product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There were no index funds following it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It only was reconstituted once a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If I recall, it was based on prices at the end of May, and it was redone at the end of June.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, that's correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So when this became a product, when index funds started using the Russell 1000 as their benchmark, so it was a Russell 1000 index fund and a Russell 2000 index fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So money was actually being traded around these two indices, that front-running started to occur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, hedge funds started to say, well, we know a month beforehand what's going to go into the Russell 2000, what's going to come out, what's going to go into the Russell 1000, and we know how much money is being managed to these indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's jump the gun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's get in front of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And this caused some problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you talk about that era of Russell?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think one of the side effects of being transparent is, like you suggest, we're conveying information to the marketplace in advance of the trade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So index providers doesn't impact us as much, but it clearly would impact potentially the index funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a number of different dimensions here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the first one is, just in terms of whether there's front-running or not, there are a lot of academic studies that were done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Some would show a stronger effect for some indexes than others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The S&P 500 index effect is fairly well known, and then there was some effect around the Russell 2000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the arguments was, better to provide this information broadly than not at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you had to err on the side of, well, even if we know there's people that might try and trade advance, the solution isn't to not disclose that information to anybody, because that just creates even more suspicion around the index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the argument is, as long as we're providing material information to the public all at the same time, that's the most fair approach from an index provider's point of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing I would highlight is, obviously, the fund managers were aware of this, and potentially they could employ different techniques.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not aware of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That might be another topic for discussion, another speaker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think, clearly, the fund companies, knowing that this potentially could happen, also could develop different sorts of trading strategies and timing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Vanguard, I think, was one that was very notable for how they traded around the rebalancing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They wouldn't disclose that, but I think it was all because they were aware of this potential impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Where I was going with this was that Russell actually changed their methodology because of it, and they went to what's called a migration strategy, where instead of June 30th, all these stocks now come out of the 1,000, go into the 2,000, all these stocks in the 2,000, go into the 1,000, and all this took place that everybody knew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">They actually began to do phase-ins over time to try to slow down any front-running that might occur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Could you explain the phase-ins?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and that's actually, I guess, one of the other dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And strictly speaking, that was not always done for the reason you suggested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at the evolution of indexes, they started out, as you said, theoretical portfolios trying to be representative of a particular asset class or segment of the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think about it, that would imply that for purposes of really trying to achieve the best representation, you might rebalance really frequently, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But as a practical matter, if you're really trying to run money, you realize, well, that creates turnover, and turnover is a cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the reasons for the banding or buffering or packaging was also to reduce the amount of turnover because, as you said, if you're only rebalancing once a year using prices as of May, that's a singular event that can cause a lot of trades going back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the reasons to introduce this more banding or buffering or migration methodologies is to kind of reduce the turnover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you could argue that companies on either side of that breakpoint really aren't that different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was also a theoretical argument for why you may not necessarily want to move companies wholesale or all at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was really more to achieve lower turnover, to be more easy for asset managers to replicate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be another reason to have that buffering or banding type rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there were actually indexes where if you could have the same stock in the growth index as you did in the value index, it was just maybe 50% was in growth or 40% was in growth and 50% or 60% was in value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was split that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a slowly migrating one direction, slowly migrating the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And these were the sort of non-growth, non-value stocks, but you had to put them somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And, yeah, and again, the other motivation there was, you know, again, in order to be a fair benchmark, if you looked at, you know, growth and value managers, they would argue that, well, there's some stocks that growth managers might hold and value managers might hold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, the original growth and value indexes, a company was either all growth or all value, and then the indexes were completely exclusive in terms of the companies they held.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you actually looked at value manager portfolios and growth manager portfolios, you would actually see empirically there was an overlap there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, not only did that reduce turnover, as you suggest, but it also was more reflective of what asset managers actually held.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And your current firm, Morningstar, when they developed their indices, they actually decided it's not going to be just value and growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They were going to have a core component as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was Morningstar's way of catching the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, it's a much more fair representation of growth and value portfolios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing I would highlight is, you know, the methodologies have evolved, you know, where Russell, you know, at the time, all we used was price to book, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Literally, price to book was the sole determinant of growth and value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, that's evolved over time where, you know, Morningstar actually uses, you know, five characteristics for value, five characteristics for growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the idea is, it's really hard to capture the growth value dimension with a single variable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You really need to have a more robust description of what is a value stock and what is a growth stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, at Morningstar, we do that for the indexes and the style box, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also a consistency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at a Morningstar style index, it is constructed very similarly using the same signals as is done for the style box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems when I look across all the index providers, S&P, Morningstar, Russell, Crisp, MSEI, et cetera, that the cuts for large cap, mid cap, small cap are fairly similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that when you look at the performance of all the different small cap indices, there's a fairly narrow range of return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Same thing, perhaps, with mid cap and certainly large cap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a very narrow range of return because the cuts for what is large cap, what is mid cap, what is small cap are fairly close.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But when it comes to value and growth investing, the way or the methodologies that are used to determine what's growth and what's value are all over the map.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">As you said, Russell uses a single-factor price-to-book model and Morningstar uses a multi-factor model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">All of the under-index providers have their own methodology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Value is in the eyes of the beholder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the returns, therefore, are much more disperse among the index providers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Some accounting values can be subject to, I hate to say manipulation, but they can be managed, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you think about it, originally, value might have been defined by price-to-earnings, but I think there's definitely concerns about how earnings can be managed using various different accounting techniques.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Book value tended to be more stable, but even book value has issues when you have companies with maybe large write-offs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think the whole idea is, you know, coming up, again, with a more robust way of defining value, potentially looking at different variables, taking some sort of an average across those variables, and coming up with a signal that you could argue is much more robust as you're looking at individual companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's move on to other asset classes, like fixed income.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, fixed income creates a challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of fixed income is not traded on a stock exchange, so a lot of it is just not traded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, you still have to come up with indices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And Lehman Brothers came up with the first aggregate bond market indice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, in episode 45 of Bogle Heads on Investing, I interviewed Nick Gendron, who was at Lehman Brothers and worked on the aggregate bond market index and is now doing the same thing at Bloomberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you done much work with fixed income indexes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I have not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not – my background is typically in equity, but obviously, at Morningstar, we have a full suite of fixed income indexes that would mirror the sorts of exposures that you would see in more of an aggregate, like a formerly Lehman aggregate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It was interesting talking with him about TIPS, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, and why they were not added to the aggregate bond market index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I got the feeling in talking to him where it was Lehman's original belief that TIPS should have been added to the aggregate bond market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was actually the companies that were licensing that index, either as a benchmark or using it to run money against, that back in the early 2000s, when TIPS were first coming out, they were the ones who asked that it not be included.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's this tension between having an index that is the best representation of a particular asset class versus something that's tradable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">On the equity side, the analogy might be REITs, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I think generally when you look at the small cap indexes, REITs tend to show up in fairly healthy proportions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some asset managers that don't – either aren't allowed to invest in REITs or don't like REITs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you would have seen a similar thing on the equity side where there's people who would have said, hey, can you keep REITs out of the portfolio?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a similar principle there in terms of what is the real purpose of the index and why you might try to leave certain stocks out or securities out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And this gets to my next point, which is nobody was telling Russell back in the 1980s what to include in their Russell 3000 or even in their original growth and value and size indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody was telling you that you were coming up with a benchmark and the asset managers didn't have any real say in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems though things have changed and that the index providers now are creating indexes, yes, that are benchmarks, yes, that are used as the basis for index funds, but that the asset managers who that they're licensing these indexes to also have some say in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, in my interview with David Blitzer, which was podcast number two, he talks about going out to the major holders of the S&P 500 and discussing these issues with them, not to say particular companies, but just a more significant part of changes that occur in indexes have at least some participation by the licensees of the index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, I think, you know, as we look at now the sort of latter part of the index history, it's more about, you know, indexes being created as for the basis of an investment product, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The last 20, 20 or so years or 30 years, I guess, especially, you know, with the advent of the ETF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yes, I think it's more about choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what you were mentioning, it started out much more research driven, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Russell and other firms, as a result of their research and, again, doing things like, you know, assessing active managers would come up with what they felt were the right principles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But as the industry has evolved, it really is now, you know, people are now being given more choices of how they want to invest, the ability to get more discrete, granular exposures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a lot more input now from clients from the market in terms of what sort of additional choices do people want to have and what should they have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1787" target="_blank">00:29:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's much more demand driven now than research driven, I would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember when South Korea was going to be taken out of the emerging market index and put into the developed market index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a big discussion about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, one index provider did it and another one didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure where it fits right now, but there was big discussion about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">How much is it going to impact our portfolios?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we're in that camp as well where we continue to have, you know, South Korea as an emerging market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But this really comes back to the benefit of having a rules-based methodology because we have rules for how companies get classified as developed or emerging, which determines their inclusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, the beauty of not having to have some sort of an internal meeting is if someone says, well, why do you have South Korea in your index that's different than the other guy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We can point to the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the rules we use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You could anticipate if South Korea were to move, you can see what were the criteria that were used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You can anticipate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you may not agree with us, but at least you can understand why we did what we did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, as you said, it could be debatable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Depending on the criteria you're using for defining who's developed, who's emerging, you might get a different answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's important to be transparent and have rules around why you make those decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to touch on this last point and call it the care and feeding of indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some terms that we threw around out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">One of them is called reconstitution, and then there's rebalancing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Talk about the difference between reconstitution and rebalancing of an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this one we get into sort of the arcana of the jargon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But strictly speaking, reconstitution means we basically reapply all the rules for determining the membership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we're looking at something, let's say, like trying to construct size indexes, we would basically go out and look at the market capitalizations of all the companies and reconstitute the indexes in terms of who's now in the large cap index, who's now in the small cap index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We would also then assign weights accordingly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A rebalancing is you don't necessarily reset all of the membership, but sometimes shares outstanding changes happen for companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So rebalancing is when you basically reset the company weights back to their targets, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So you aren't changing the selection of stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You're sticking with the existing set of stocks, but you're now rebalancing them back to their target weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's sort of more of it in a general way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So reconstitution means completely choosing or resetting the membership of the indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Rebalancing typically means we're just adjusting the weights of those constituents back to their targets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And Russell did this once a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">How often does Morningstar do this, the reconstitution part?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Best practice generally is semi-annually, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're only rebalancing one time a year, you have to hold on to that now for another year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think semi-annual rebalancing seems to be this happy medium in terms of really making sure you're representing the market by, you know, reconstituting the index every six months and not just holding it stale for an entire year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how often do you rebalance, you know, shares outstanding?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Quarterly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Quarterly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Effectively, the portfolio is the weights are being reset on a quarterly basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, two times would be because of the reconstitution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But then off the reconstitution cycle, there's a rebalance happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And what about, you know, big new issues that come to the market?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there exceptions for big new issues?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">How would you include that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Generally, IPOs come in through the normal reconstitution process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The goal isn't to capture these things as quickly as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Generally, you want to have some sort of a seasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the expectation is, you know, IPOs will generally get picked up at least within six months during a reconstitution cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's the other thing to highlight is, obviously, we have the quarterly cycle, you know, rebalancing reconstitution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're basically managing a paper portfolio that has to replicate the experience that an investor would have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So things like splits, other corporate actions, we actually are simulating those as we manage the index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's on a daily basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So spinoffs, mergers, acquisitions, anything that's going to happen to a company in reality, we have to reflect in the index portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's something we do on a daily basis, you know, reflecting corporate activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to talk about the difference between full market replication and free float.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Back in the late 90s, there was a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Wilshire 5000, if you recall at the time, a lot of the stocks in there were, you couldn't really replicate the Wilshire 5000 because so much of the stock was held by insiders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so eventually, index providers changed their methodologies to go to free float.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could describe the difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the academic theory would talk about holding companies in proportion to their total market capitalization, which is their, you know, shares outstanding, what are listed on the exchange times their price, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the total market capitalization of the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what we use to reflect the size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you mentioned, what actually happens is not all shares outstanding are necessarily trading in the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they're locked up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can have situations where a company might have only 50% of their shares are trading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though you might see their total market capitalization as one number, in reality, only 50% is available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about it, if someone is trying to replicate an index with a large amount of money, if they try to achieve that relative weight, in some cases, especially for smaller companies, it can have a price effect, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, I think the reason S&P moved to float back in the early 2000s was because they had a major addition that came in at total market capitalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">All the index fund managers were trying to, you know, to hold that at the weight, and it created this huge price impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't remember the stock, but it would show the impact of trying to hold a company based on its total shares outstanding, as opposed to its float shares outstanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people call this the opportunity set for investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the free float is the opportunity set we all have on the outside that we can invest in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The shares that Mark Zuckerberg holds or Jeff Bezos holds of his own company, they're not part of the free float.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is what's available, and this is how the indexes are created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They all moved or migrated to free float, I want to say, in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically now, with the exception of very few indices, all of them are free float.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And free float really is a proxy for what we would call capacity, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2148" target="_blank">00:35:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So how much of a stock realistically can you hold before you start to create price impacts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's related to liquidity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people would say liquidity, but strictly speaking, we use the term capacity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But float is really a proxy for how much of this stock is really available for the general investor, such that index funds or all investors, in fact, right, can hold, can get positions in that particular security.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about the S&P, and we've talked about Russell indices, and there are, of course, many other total market indices out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of them is kind of my favorite wonky index, and I know that a lot of people who are listening to this may not agree with, is the NASDAQ 100, which is what QQQs, the ETF QQQs, a benchmark to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2191" target="_blank">00:36:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the history behind the NASDAQ 100 is a little bit wonky in itself because the New York Stock Exchange decided that in order to get publicity, they were going to create their own New York Stock Exchange index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it started to get some

we need our own index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So they created the NASDAQ 100, which was supposed to be the largest 100 stocks that trade on the NASDAQ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2215"

NASDAQ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a cap on the value of any particular stock that you could have in the index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2228"

target="_blank">00:37:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But you should be aware that using an exchange as the criteria for creating a portfolio is somewhat arbitrary.</span></div><div

out with industry sectors and they came out with the technology industry sector ETFs and index funds, I said, well, if you want technology, why would people just buy that?</span></div><div

continue to get into indexes as a product as opposed to indexes as a benchmark or economic indicator or price indicator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">This has become a huge business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">As an index provider, you've been in the industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2317" target="_blank">00:38:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you used to get paid at Russell for using your benchmarks if somebody wanted to use your benchmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But now, as a benchmark for ETFs or for index funds, it's a really lucrative business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2332" target="_blank">00:38:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it like the most lucrative part of indexing, is it not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Depends on the provider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think clearly it's become a bigger and bigger component of most index providers' revenue streams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2343" target="_blank">00:39:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Every provider potentially has a different mix of how much they make from data subscriptions versus licensing for investable products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then even things like derivatives, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2351" target="_blank">00:39:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Potentially, you might consider that a third stream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">As we've talked about, we sort of captured the first two uses of indexes, you know, asset class proxy, a measure of the market, and then benchmarks for active managers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This latter stage of the index world is the use as the basis of an investable product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Since the advent of the ETF in the early 90s, that's really now where we've seen most of the growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But as I mentioned, so prior to the ETF launch, you would have seen providers like Russell and MSCI would have made the majority of their revenues licensing the index data to active managers because they were using it as a benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">S&P was actually making money more around, you know, trading of futures and options, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you kind of had that investable side there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But once the ETF got launched, what you saw is incredible demand now to use indexes as the basis of funds, which has now continued to this day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's definitely a much bigger component of our revenue streams as it has been, but most of us still make a decent amount of revenue from the data subscriptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a term for the indexes that are created solely for the purpose of creating a product, special purpose indexes, spindexes for short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It outperforms the

important for the investors to say, why do I think these companies are going to do better, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the reason I want to get this exposure?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes back to, what do I know that others don't know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2498" target="_blank">00:41:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all about

markets would tell me that all companies have been priced equally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2502" target="_blank">00:41:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, if I'm willing to buy one of these more narrowly described indexes, I must think I know something that the market

in index funds, I think it's safe to say that most of that money are in these core products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2565"

the press is around what you call the spindexes, most of the flows and AUM that you hear reported is still going into the broad beta products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

early 2000s, it's not that way anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in order to launch an ETF, you had to have an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You had to follow an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There were no actively managed ETFs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If somebody wanted to launch an ETF, they had to have the index created first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2607" target="_blank">00:43:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I remember, I think it was 2004, a new index was created called an Intellidex index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was created by the American Stock Exchange for the benefit of PowerShares.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">PowerShares was a new ETF company that launched ETFs tracking these Intellidex indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I first looked at those Intellidex indexes, I said, there's no way the SEC is going to allow this to be called an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But I was wrong because these Intellidex indexes were quantitative fund selection, alternative weighting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2643" target="_blank">00:44:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They weren't cap weighted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They were weighted by other methodologies using fundamentals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were pure active management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The only difference was they were created first in a index and then the fund manager, PowerShares, followed within 80% because that's the rule, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a fund manager, you have to do 80% of what the index is to be able to call yourself an index fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But they were calling themselves a passive index fund provider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I almost fell off my chair when I saw this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, where is the SEC on this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But this has now become the norm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Active management can get away with being called passive index investing if they created some sort of a rules-based index first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only that, it used to be you had to go out and you had to hire an indexing company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you can do self-indexing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So me as the fund company, I can create my own index and then I can follow the index in a fund or an ETF and I can call myself a passive index fund manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you feel about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you can see I have issues with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a huge turmoil in the industry, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Not only the Intellidex, but I think you saw with the fundamental index a few years later because, again, most people's concept of an index was it has to be broad market, market cap weighted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But clearly, something like an Intellidex was obviously an active strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2726" target="_blank">00:45:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I could make an argument that even when you start to break up the market by large, small growth value, that implies you're making an active decision somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But most people didn't think that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's been this incredible blurring now of what's active, what's passive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2738" target="_blank">00:45:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that just highlights, as you say, you can now have much more, call them active strategies, doing a variety of different things, but positioned as an index for purposes of an ETF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2748" target="_blank">00:45:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, it really begs the question, then what is the distinction now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it does come back to rules-based and transparent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's no longer this academic definition of active and passive because everything's really active now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you go past the broad market portfolio, right, you're now in some sort of active space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So really, the distinction now is, is it truly rules-based, i.e., is there any discretion, and is it transparent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because obviously, the whole concept behind an active strategy is, I must know something the market doesn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to share that because I'll lose that edge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So in theory, if I'm making something transparent, it's not active, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just that sort of reverse logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2782" target="_blank">00:46:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's sort of the litmus test I'm applying is, are they making the rules transparent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2788" target="_blank">00:46:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's still what we would call an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's interesting the pivot these active managers took over the years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The way they responded to Jack Bogle back in 1976 was, you know, indexing is un-American.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think we're beyond that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And indexing is not only here to stay, but it's probably the preferred strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're an active manager, you've got to do something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got to muddy the water, and you've got to try to convince people that what you're doing is better than traditional broad cap-weighted indexes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We were at an indexing conference back in 2007 when the S&P 500 was 50 years old, and research affiliates ran a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal congratulating Standard & Poor's for 50 years, and then said, and now we're the indexes for the next 50 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they're trying to muddy the water.</span></div><div class="c"><span

type of indexing, which is the basic traditional indexing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2843"

more expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of them don't

comment I would make is, you know, that's sort of as American as you can get, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2855"

working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It just sometimes takes time

<span class="t">Because I know when S&P started coming out with the SPIVA study, and even before that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there were other studies, academic studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've been looking at these studies, reading these studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done my own studies for more than 25 years, and the data always seemed to come out the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're just using these traditional, low-cost, total market index funds or broad market index funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">active managers have a very difficult time outperforming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that what you saw,

much?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Not really.</span></div><div

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure if there's been attribution there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think what's really important for people to understand is this whole sort of constant distinction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">between or debate around active and passive management generally focuses on are markets efficient or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's always sort of been the traditional sort of belief you have to have whether active management works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But to me, an even probably more important principle that Sharpe defined was the zero-sum game, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That his point was the sum of all investor portfolios equals the broad market, which is just a big average, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So by definition, passive managers are going to get the market experience, right, by investing in the market portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So his whole point was it's a zero-sum game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so half the people have to outperform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">By definition, half the people have to underperform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So even going into these studies, your expectation should be about half of anyone trying to be active is going to underperform the market average, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We all can't be above average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, that's a really important principle for any investor to think about because it comes back to do I know something or do I think I can find someone who knows more than the market, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Because half of the time I'm going to be right and half the time I'm going to be wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So to me, the whole zero-sum game principle, the arithmetic of active management is really the most – it's the more powerful concept to think about as an investor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's active management less fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Morningstar does a study every year where they analyze the fees based on capitalization weight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last one I saw saw that active equity funds, although they've come down a lot, are charging still about 0.6 on average, whereas index funds are much lower, like 0.06.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that difference, that 55 or so, 60 basis points difference, is meaningful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you have to get over that hurdle rate before you even start to outperform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And the bonds, it's about 40 basis points difference between the active bond funds and the index funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's just one asset class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You're looking at U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds, and they all come out to about the same over the long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But I did a study with Alex Benke, who used to be a better mentor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We did a study back in the, oh, about 10 years ago, and we made a case for index fund portfolios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you're looking at all these things just in isolation, you could say, well, index funds outperform active funds in the U.S. stock market, say, you know, 75% of the time over a five-year period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And in bonds, it does this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">In international, it does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But what if you were going to have a diversified portfolio of U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds, maybe real estate, maybe just those four asset classes together in a portfolio?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What if you just used all index funds?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, actually, the performance of that portfolio goes up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, yes, maybe one of them you may have, if you were trying to pick active funds, you may have picked out of those four, you may have picked an active fund that did better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3098" target="_blank">00:51:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But the other active funds you picked maybe did worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">When you put them together, the dynamics of putting a portfolio together of a lot of traditional low-cost index funds is that that portfolio outperforms a portfolio of active funds almost 90-something percent of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in my view, we've got products out there like balanced index funds and target-date retirement funds that follow indices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think these are wonderful products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you feel about those?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, people just assume that investing is hard, and therefore, you know, you need to spend a lot of time and energy and hire all these smart people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the reality that you're highlighting is there are possible ways for you to achieve your goals with fairly simple portfolios and simple products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's no question for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think there's human behavior then becomes part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3147" target="_blank">00:52:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, every once in a while, I might go to a slot machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I'm smart enough to know that I'm probably going to lose all my money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, to be honest, I mean, some of it can be entertainment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I think some people like to brag at cocktail parties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, it's definitely a fair point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think I would also reemphasize maybe something that I haven't said directly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The only true passive investor is holding the broadest portfolio, market portfolio possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the point I made earlier, even if you're starting to hold large-cap, small-cap growth value in these broad exposures, there's an active decision in there somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think, you know, as much as we highlight that, you know, active managers, it appears that they're not able to beat their benchmarks, I'd say anyone who's sort of starting to do anything active, even if it's just managing those more discrete exposures, it's the same principle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, what do you think you know more than the broad market portfolio?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It even simplifies things more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In essence, if you truly wanted to be a passive investor, you would just hold the broad market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't even need to hold the broad market components like large, small growth and value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We have something called the three-fund portfolio, which does exactly that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that, well, I couldn't ask for a better ending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOofxK4jgV8&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Rolf, it's been wonderful having you
