Let's say you do okay at work meetings, but you want to just like own the room. You want to be like a powerful force of leadership and speaking up and authority. So then you say, okay, I'm going to have a commitment.</p><p>Like every single meeting, I'm going to intentionally speak up and I'm going to intentionally steer at once. I'm going to intentionally ask a question. And so you start to build that. That's the action side. Now the habit that really strengthens that, and it serves multiple purposes. It neutralizes the critic and it builds your optimal coach.</p><p>And this one is right after the meeting is done. Don't just do it in your head, force yourself to do it on a note file on your phone or on a sheet of paper where you write down three wins from the meeting right afterwards. What are three things that you did that went well?</p><p>You might say, nah, nah, I don't need to do that. I know I was fine. It went great. No, no, no. This is going to really encode it into your, your identity. And it doesn't matter what you write down. It matters that you're training your brain to say, Hey, when I go into these situations, I'm competence.</p></div></div></body></html>
