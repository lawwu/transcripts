And those sleep spindles, we didn't talk about their function yet, but they're really important for moving memories to our cortex. It's a unique time when our hippocampus, sort of like the REM of our brains, writes it to a hard disk, which is the cortex.</p><p>It's a unique time when they're connected. So if you don't want to miss that, you don't want to miss REM sleep, which is also a part of a consolidation process and schema-changing process. And alcohol, before we go to sleep, will do that. Until we've metabolized alcohol and put it out of our bodies, it will affect our sleep badly.</p><p>So probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol within the four to six hours preceding sleep, given the half-life. Given the half-life. Or it all would be better, but I know some people refuse to go that way. Maybe a little bit is okay. I don't know what the dose response is, but there are studies out there you can look at.</p><p>Great. So we're still in the first stage of sleep, and I apologize for slowing us down, but it sounds like it's an incredibly important first phase of sleep. What about the second and third 90-minute blocks of sleep? Is there anything that makes those unique? What is their signature, besides the fact that they come second and third in the night?</p><p>There's more and more REM sleep the later, the night we get. There's also a change in hormones, the growth hormone and melatonin levels are starting to decline, but other hormones are picking up. So it is a really different stage that you also don't want to shortchange yourself on. And I think that's the stage many studies are showing that those are the times in sleep when the most creativity can happen.</p><p>That's when our dreams can incorporate and put together old and new things together into a new way, and our schema are built during that time. So yeah, we can change our minds best during those phases of sleep.</p></div></div></body></html>
