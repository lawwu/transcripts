And I remember just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">playing with my two at the time two year old son and I couldn't get up off the floor because I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">too fat and stiff from sitting in my chair. And I was like, this is this is not good. And I looked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at like, what do I have to show for it? I didn't even have zero inbox. I wish I could say I did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I didn't write I just had like, my Twitter feed was all answered or something.

And I think you're you sort of captured that in this latest book is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">people are fed up with doing more. Yeah, I mean, I think people aren't anti productivity really so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">much as they're anti overload. Right? Like this idea of I have too much to do, which doesn't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">mean I'm really busy, because I have a lot of things to do. But it also means that the administrative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">overhead that comes with each of these tasks is now starting to pile up to the point where I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">barely actually making progress on any work, like the state of overload is uniquely deranging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the pandemic put a lot of knowledge workers into that mode. And they personify that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">frustration by saying, well, you know, screw you productivity, right? Because I mean, you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about loosely, what is productivity? I don't know, like trying to do more, like trying to produce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">more, and more is the absolute less thing I need. So I mean, I think the pandemic, a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">had your same experience, which is overload got to a place where it's side effects became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">intolerable. Something has to change. The hard part was figuring out what, but I think most people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">agreed something had to change. Yeah, for me, I started with the physical, because a friend of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">mine ran a personal training company, he was like, you need a trainer. And I was like, Oh, I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to say no to that. Because that's, that's just fact at this point, if I can't get up off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the floor from playing Legos. So that started things, but then it was like, well, I'm feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">good and playing with my kid more. So maybe I will put some tasks aside. And I sort of almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">accidentally discovered some of this where I was like, you know, now that I actually feel good,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to spend any more time, I don't want to spend time going in the opposite direction by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, trying to do more busy work.

But aside from other people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going through it in the pandemic, at the same time, it seems like there's more happening with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this because people are actually taking action. They're not just feeling it. They're starting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">go to hell with this, right? That we heard of quiet quitting. It's kind of related to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I know it. Yes. Yeah. I wrote a New Yorker piece about this a couple years ago that got some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">attention. So yeah, I'm pretty familiar with it. What can you tell us what that is? For those of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">us who probably don't even have never heard of this? Well, the way I see it now is quiet quitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was actually one of several waves of reform disruption within knowledge work that happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because of the pandemic. So the quiet quitting wave, this was largely Gen Z, though it did extend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond there, sparked by TikTok. So it got sparked by TikTok and then spread through other social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">media. The idea was to do the bare minimum at work. So I'm not officially quitting. I'm keeping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">my job, but I'm not going to do almost anything beyond the bare minimum. And it's usually the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sentiment was expressed in a sort of antagonistic employer employee relationship. Like I am about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">more than my labor.

It spread really fast because of social media virality. It also kind of got squashed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty fast because there were some pretty obvious, I would say, reactions to quiet quitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that were less than positive.

I understand the desire to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that, but it's actually really good if you're the type of person who can put the work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in because if all your if all your colleagues are quiet quitting and you're like, I'll take the lead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on that project, that's that ends up working out for you.

Okay, and I have to sit in the room while y'all wait for the fax because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">then we can bill the client for my hourly rate in addition to the other 20 associates who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sitting here. And it's like the untold thing, the untold sort of grift was, "Yeah, if there's 30 of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">us waiting for the fax, we bill like thousands of dollars per hour.

This is like the 1950s and '60s. The term knowledge work is coined in 1959 because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it wasn't a big enough sector of work, the sector where you use your mind to add value to information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It just wasn't a big enough thing to even label until the mid-20th century.

So one of the big ideas is we're very, we're bad at managing our workloads and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we should care about it. Right. Because the issue is everything that's on our plate brings with it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">administrative overhead. Right. So like everything I say yes to, that generates emails, that generates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">meetings. I have to support this thing I've agreed to do. So as you say yes to more and more things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">more of your time has to be servicing the administrative overload of all the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on your plate.

So workload really matters. And the way that most people implicitly manage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">their workload is with stress because there is no, in most knowledge work circumstances,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">no transparent way of saying how much are you working on and how much should you be working on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and how do we manage how much you're working on?

It's none of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">business. So what people do is stress.

That feeling of overload</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is now worse than the feeling of saying no to another person.

So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">always have like 20% too much work to do. So what happened with the pandemic for knowledge workers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Overnight, you got like a bonus 20% worth of tasks, right? Because we have to shift our operations to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">run remotely. Like it generated a bunch of tasks overnight. So we have a lot of knowledge workers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">at the red line. And then like overnight, hey, let's add 20% more tasks we can't avoid. It pushed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people over. I think that was one. Two is more simple. We do in person a lot of quick ad hoc</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">interaction. I grab you after another meeting, like Jordan, what's going on with, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">client X and we can just like figure it out in a minute, have a quick back and forth and figure it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">out when we weren't in person anymore.

So we also began expanding a bunch of two-minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">conversations into 30-minute conversations. Right. And also keep in mind, those two-minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">conversations were well placed.

So it was time that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">was otherwise unspoken for. Right. So then that created the Zoom apocalypses where we had meeting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">after meeting after meeting because we were expanding a lot of the ad hoc into 30-minute plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">blocks on our calendar. So those two things, we were at the red line and we got pushed over by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">20 percent. And then we had like a big increase in meetings. The best number I saw was from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Microsoft annual work survey.

But it was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">underlying reason why we were set up for that to push us over the edge is in a pseudo productivity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">regime, you're like, hey, activity is all that matters.

And I think that's kind of the idea, right? - Yeah. I mean, so this is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">most of that chapter is on how do you get away with this. Because if you have control of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">own schedule, and let's be clear, if you're an entrepreneur or a solopreneur or whatever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not that this is trivial, right? Even after you get over the psychology of doing fewer things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not that it's trivial, but there's like one key trick if you're an entrepreneur,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is you can't reduce what you're working on each day if you don't reduce the number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">projects you're working on, and you can't reduce the number of projects you're working on unless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you reduce the number of missions you're pursuing in your job. So start from the top down. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">simplify at the highest level what you're trying to do, then you'll have less projects you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">working on, and then, so that's the key trick for there. But if you work for someone else,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">most of the ideas that I give are based on making workload transparent. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just like you were saying, like, the biggest thing that helps support pseudoproductivity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is that no one talks about their workload. It's all informal. And so everyone sees everyone else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">as a vessel to make their life easier by executing work that they need done. And when they just see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you as a black box work-executing vessel, it's like, this would be great if you could do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's annoying to me if you can't. What you need to do instead is break that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2972" target="_blank">00:49:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mental model by making your workload transparent. And there's a bunch of ways to do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but, like, the simple way – here's, like, the vanilla way of doing this that's actually really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">effective – is that you keep track of what's on your plate, and you divide it between actively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">working on and queued up for me to work on, right? So you make a distinction of the things you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">said yes to, actively working on, queued up to work on, and here's the order it's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And you let other people into this context. And so someone comes up and says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, can you do this for me?" One way or the other – you can word it however you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">word it – but one way or the other, you're basically saying, "Yeah, sure. Here's my workload</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">tracker. Just throw it on there at the end of the queue of things that I'm waiting to work on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and, like, let me know, like, what I need to do it or that I should call you when the time comes."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now they have to confront two things. One, "Oh, he's not actively working on this yet. It's at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the back of this queue, and until it gets up here, he's not actively working on it, so no emails,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">no meetings until he's actively working on it." Two, they get a realistic picture of your workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and they realize, "Oh, OK, he's saying yes, but all of these things have to get done first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">so it might be a while." So either I'm going to say, "You know what? It's not that important,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">or my expectation is going to be recalibrated, or if I'm your boss, I say, "No, no, this has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to be done now." You're able to bring them into the workload process, be like, "Great, I'm with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you.

You let me know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which one is lowest priority." They're now involved in that as well, right? And they now have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">explicitly – and I'm saying this in a way that sounds somewhat confrontational. The book talks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">about how to do this, you know, without just being like, "Hey, boss, use my spreadsheet." But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially, this is the mindset that completely changes people's relationship with work assignments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">- Man, I love it, because instead of no, it's no, and here's a bunch of great reasons why, or yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but here's also why.

Because most people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the trade-off is, "I have to be emailing all the time.

And I really push — and I talk about this a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch in the book — is, like, if you're an entrepreneur, you can experiment massively,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like, here's an example. It's an entrepreneur. It's a solo shop. She, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3897" target="_blank">01:04:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">does coaching, and then she has maybe four or five sort of part-time virtual-type people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3902" target="_blank">01:05:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So it's like that scale of a shop. And she figured out at some point, she's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">"Here's what I'm going to do.

And she's like, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3911" target="_blank">01:05:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not too hard to work out.

So I realized at some point — people don't realize that if you're at a research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3947" target="_blank">01:05:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">institution as a professor, the school pays your salary for 10 months. And the two months over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">summer, they don't pay your salary. And so, like, what most people do is their research grants,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3958" target="_blank">01:05:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they ask in their research grant budgets for what's called summer salary. And that's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3962" target="_blank">01:06:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you fill in those last two months as it's coming out of your grants, right?

And in fact, the push I had was — when I first started was, "Well, if you — you can get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3973" target="_blank">01:06:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">three months, technically speaking, if you have three different research grants, you can take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3977" target="_blank">01:06:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">month of summer salary from each and actually get paid three months' worth of salary in two months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=3982" target="_blank">01:06:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what you want to try to do."

And there's a lot of professors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4022" target="_blank">01:07:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">who make that same trade who don't also write books and do whatever. What they do is they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4026" target="_blank">01:07:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">just adjust their spending.

I can take the whole summer." So a lot of professors who don't do research will teach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4036" target="_blank">01:07:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">summer classes to try to fill in their salary.

And I won't say doing nothing because she gets a lot of stuff done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4439" target="_blank">01:13:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But she's also one of the I had a problem many years ago where I separated from one business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">into another. And she's like, you need a she didn't call it a cool down period. But it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">basically what you talk about, which is like a cool down. She's like, go to Hawaii for two months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4455" target="_blank">01:14:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and just don't do anything. And that was too scary. I didn't take her advice. I kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4460" target="_blank">01:14:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">probably should have let me get your opinion on that. Because I I had an interesting argument</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4465" target="_blank">01:14:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about this with with Ryan holiday. So I want to get your opinion, right? What do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4469" target="_blank">01:14:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">would happen if you're with Amazon, right? That in terms of I'm not No, no, I'm on podcast one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4475" target="_blank">01:14:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's funny. I almost went to Amazon. That's okay. So let's say I talked about it. Let's say next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4478" target="_blank">01:14:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">time you negotiate your contract with podcast one, like what if you said, yeah, I podcast 10 months a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4484" target="_blank">01:14:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">year, right? And then like two months, I don't. So and it's like you go to like Hawaii or do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4489" target="_blank">01:14:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. So I brought this up on on Ryan show, because I'm really thinking about this is, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4495" target="_blank">01:14:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">know, telling my my ad agency, I'm independent, but my ad agency books about a year in advance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4499" target="_blank">01:14:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">worth of my ads, right? And I was like, yeah, I'm thinking of telling them, let's book, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4504" target="_blank">01:15:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">45 weeks, or whatever, 46 weeks. And I'm just going to take when I'm gone in the summer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4510" target="_blank">01:15:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like not worrying about like podcast or whatever, because I was doing the same sort of math,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4513" target="_blank">01:15:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? I was like, yeah, it's less money. But like, does it matter? Like, for me, I'm not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4518" target="_blank">01:15:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not the pen, you know, it's all kind of funny money to me. Anyways, it changes each year. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like, whatever, why not? That would be great not to have to record. Ryan was very worried about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4526" target="_blank">01:15:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this. Right. And this was in public. So I'm not talking about school. He's like, I don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4531" target="_blank">01:15:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about this. I'm worried about this, because you're going to lose your audience. And people are not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4535" target="_blank">01:15:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to become used to listening to you anymore. And there's like a whole momentum thing. So okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4538" target="_blank">01:15:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you be the arbiter here, because I'm going to try to convince you to do the same if I do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4542" target="_blank">01:15:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that is that really scary? Or is it we're just telling ourselves the story? Yeah, I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4548" target="_blank">01:15:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">nervous about not doing the work. With podcasts, though, tons of them go in seasons, right? Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4555" target="_blank">01:15:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it used to not be the case. Tons of podcasts go in seasons. Now it'll be like 12 episodes or 24</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4560" target="_blank">01:16:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">episodes of this TV goes in seasons, right, but they have to advertise the next season. What I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4565" target="_blank">01:16:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what I would do if I were you in this particular situation is in certain apps, like Apple podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4571" target="_blank">01:16:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">will stop downloading, it'll be like, hey, this show hasn't been updated. Do you still want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4574" target="_blank">01:16:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">listen and people have to kind of like re opt in. What you could do is take episodes like this one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4579" target="_blank">01:16:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm doing with you. And you could be like, alright, that was that was half decent. Why don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4582" target="_blank">01:16:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I save that? And I'll do that. I'll air that during my summer break. And I'll do it. I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4588" target="_blank">01:16:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">air the one I got did with Ryan during my summer break. And we'll I'll run two of those that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4592" target="_blank">01:16:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">already done. You did like no work other than being the work you're doing right now sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4596" target="_blank">01:16:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">here suffering through this conversation with me. But you're doing no work to produce,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">write and edit the thing really, your team can get it done ahead of time. And then you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4604" target="_blank">01:16:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">something to put in your feed. But it's not doesn't require you to then sit down and produce it. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4610" target="_blank">01:16:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, you could, of course, and you've already thought of this, you could also record episodes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4613" target="_blank">01:16:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in advance, right? That's the other solution. And then you don't have to do any work during that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4617" target="_blank">01:16:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">time, right? That's sort of the ideal, but that requires you to do all the prep and all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4621" target="_blank">01:17:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">production for those episodes. Yeah, so it could be a sort of a pseudo hiatus, right? It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4627" target="_blank">01:17:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, in the summer season. It's it's like reruns, right? And then like the new stuff starts again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4633" target="_blank">01:17:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's like enough to like keep you active in the podcast freeds and Apple doesn't unsubscribe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4638" target="_blank">01:17:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you and people like, oh, this is a good one or button your downloads go down.

I've put episodes where somebody interviews me and people are like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4679" target="_blank">01:17:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">wow, I've never heard you interviewed before.

And again, I'm going to cover a lot of this in the show,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4705" target="_blank">01:18:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in the show clothes.

And like, when that coffee is done, I'm kind of like, done with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4738" target="_blank">01:18:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">particular project that I find helps me do certain kinds of work.

There's just so much in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4751" target="_blank">01:19:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your book that is very practical. I don't want people to think that the whole book is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4754" target="_blank">01:19:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">two guys complaining about how there are too many meetings, because that's not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4758" target="_blank">01:19:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not what you wrote about. Yeah, I mean, there's the there's the reduce part. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4762" target="_blank">01:19:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there's the amplify part. Yeah, how do you produce better stuff, which is which is the glue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4768" target="_blank">01:19:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for everything else, right? So this, this third principle obsess over quality. It's the glue for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4773" target="_blank">01:19:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the other two, right? If you don't do that, if you don't care about like, how do I like really begin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4779" target="_blank">01:19:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to care more about what I do best and like, push myself to do it better. If you don't do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4782" target="_blank">01:19:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you only just try to reduce workload. And you only try to work at a natural pace, that's probably not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4787" target="_blank">01:19:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to work. Right? Because it keeps you in this mindset of just like, I don't know, I don't like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4791" target="_blank">01:19:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">work, I want to do less of it. It's not very sustainable psychologically. But when you obsess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4794" target="_blank">01:19:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">over the quality of what you do, those ideas become inevitable and natural. It's like, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4799" target="_blank">01:19:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm trying to do this thing better. Busyness is incompatible with me doing this better. So of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4804" target="_blank">01:20:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">course, I want to try to simplify things. And then that's why the flywheel starts getting pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQdGW5rnJiY&t=4808" target="_blank">01:20:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">quick.
