When we first started this show, our assumption is, most people would ask questions about the markets of their portfolios. That's the kind of stuff that came into my inbox. Hence the name, Portfolio Rescue, right? But as the show has gone on to bring a more range of questions in, things will continue to expand.</p><p>So we get questions now, barely any of them on markets or portfolios. Some of them are, but mostly it's taxes, retirement, insurance, spending, housing, debt, and just a bunch of other topics, too. Sometimes people ask me fashion advice, which I'm more than happy to give. So we felt it was time for Name Brand to better align the show with the questions that are coming in from our audience, because you guys are the ones that are giving us the topics every week.</p><p>So Portfolio Rescue will now be called Ask the Compound. And it worked because we already had the email, right? Duncan, AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. So it's not like it's a huge departure. Still going to be lots of investing in markets and portfolio-related questions, but Ask the Compound just makes more sense when you consider the breadth of questions that we get.</p><p>We also weren't really rescuing that many portfolios. We had people writing in, "Hey, I make $400,000 a year." We're helping on the edges, right? Yeah. They were asking questions. So remember, AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. Our sponsor today is Bird Dogs. Duncan, I just got a new shipment in of these bad boys.</p><p>See them? They're so comfy. You got-- Oh, yeah, yeah. I have those. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The liner's great. My favorite thing is still the side pocket, because you put your wallet in there, and you don't sit on it. You don't think your rear end falls asleep if you're sitting on a wallet.</p><p>I hate that. Go to Bird Dogs, BirdDogs.com. Use the code BenPR. BenPR. Still using the old Portfolio Rescue references here, but that's what they gave us before. You get a free Tumblr. I don't use a lot of Tumblrs, because I'm not a coffee drinker. I know a lot of people use them, though, right?</p><p>So remember, BenPR. Really quick here, the whole premise of this show has always been that our audience dictates the content, right? So the content. Each week, we pick the best or most relevant topical questions. Last week, there was a handful of questions with people who have six-figure salaries or seven-figure net worths, right?</p><p>I have all this money, not to brag, all this stuff. A few people in the chat, listen, I'm in there. I'm listening to you people. I'm hearing the feedback. They said, "All these not to brag questions are useless to me, because I'm not in that same financial stratosphere." Fair pushback.</p><p>I'm willing to listen to feedback. I will say, though, a lot of this stuff does scale, though. You know, like, even if you don't have $4 million, a lot of the principles still apply that we're talking about. Here's the thing. So many of these finance questions are useful if you know how to apply them to your circumstances, right?</p><p>I started my career in the institutional asset management business. I worked with nonprofits who had portfolios of hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, sometimes tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions, up to a billion dollars, right? So the circumstances were different for each of these organizations, depending on the size of their portfolio.</p><p>But there were still plenty of similarities to how we manage the portfolios, right? Each investment plan looked at the organization's risk profile and time horizon and spending needs, and then created an asset allocation based on those premises, right? So the way I saw it is the investment philosophy is universal.</p><p>The strategy is just personal. So I always thought, like, the billion dollar or hundred million dollar portfolios, it was just an extra zero. You still have to think of investing the same way. And I think that the personal finance topics are the same thing. Sure, this person has $6 million, and maybe you only have $60,000 saved in your IRA, but they're still thinking about a lot of the same things.</p><p>Sure, your financial life becomes a little more complicated, and we have more money, and maybe there's some other strategies on the edges that you have to think about. But the big questions, the behavioral stuff, getting the big building block stuff right is still exactly the same, no matter how much money you have.</p><p>I've always thought that. And so what you're saying is go back and watch all of our old episodes if you haven't yet. Yeah. And what do you know, we got a handful of questions from viewers that don't involve not to brag situations this week, so let's get into one.</p><p>Yeah, and thanks for the questions, because yeah, we literally said last week, I think, these are the questions we're getting. You want to hear something different? Send some questions. And people did. So up first, we have a question from Matt. "A few weeks ago, you got a question about paying off a 6.5% mortgage early versus investing that money.</p><p>It seemed the consensus was against the early mortgage payments. Well, I have a 6% five-year auto loan on a truck that I use to haul a camper, which I live in full time. Since I do not benefit from the mortgage interest tax deductions, would it make more sense to aggressively pay off the loan in this case?</p><p>I currently have enough money in stocks that I could pay this off if I sold everything, not counting my retirement accounts. I own land that I plan to build a house on in the next two to five years. I'm 33, single, and I owe $40,000 on my truck. I have no other debt and make about $50,000 a year." This one sounds like a "House Hunters" episode.</p><p>I like this one though. So the auto loan is different from a mortgage because we're dealing with different time frames and different financial assets, right? Houses have generally appreciated in value over time and make for a good inflation hedge over the long run. Automobiles, on the other hand, are a depreciating asset.</p><p>I think the good rule of thumb is the minute you drive it off the lot, an automobile is going to be worth 10% less. I don't know if that's an old wives tale, but I've also heard, "Take an additional 10% off the sticker price every year for like five years." And that's your car depreciation, right?</p><p>Housing is a form of consumption that I think has similarities to a financial asset. Automobiles are a form of consumption that have similarities to a liability. That's the way I look at it. So, a hurdle rate of 6% per year is pretty simple on this one, but you should probably consider the tax implications of selling if you have any gains in the brokerage account.</p><p>And you can do some cost-benefit analysis. I did a little back of the envelope here. $40,000 in debt at 6% over five years, we're talking $6,400 in total interest payments over the life of the loan. So, that's not egregious, but you can save yourself some money if you pay it off.</p><p>So, that's your bogey in terms of taxes and opportunity costs if you decide to sell some stocks to pay it off. I think this one really comes down to psychology. Your expected return should probably be higher in the stock market, but if this is part of your living situation, that's potentially a different story.</p><p>I think if you do sell some stocks to pay this off, and you pay the loan, just make a pact with yourself that you're going to use those monthly payments you would've been paying towards the car loan, and dollar-cost average right back into the market, or save for your house maybe that you're going to build sometime.</p><p>So, if you're going to pay it off, don't let those payments go to waste if you decide to take care of them. Put those to good use, because then if you're taking away from a financial situation, you should help it out in other ways. Duncan, camper? Maybe is that your housing situation fixed?</p><p>No, no. I'm happy to announce, I mean, we've talked about it, but yeah, after eight Airbnbs to start the year, I'm actually settled down in a new place now. Seriously, eight Airbnbs? Yeah, eight Airbnbs. So, I did my due diligence. I'm not a shareholder, but yeah. All right, I am, so I'll take it.</p><p>All right, let's do another one. Good experiences. Overall, very good experiences. That's good. Yeah. Okay, so up next we have a question. I don't see the name. Okay. We have about $30,000 in credit card debt. My wife and I have decent jobs and live with a modest middle class Midwest lifestyle here in Wisconsin.</p><p>I'm trying to picture what that means, but find it hard to put much towards the payments other than minimums. We are making credit card payments of $750 a month with $450 of that being interest, and they say their rates are between 14 and 20%. My wife recently left her job and has a $200,000 ESOP, is that employee stock option plan?</p><p>Nailed it. Yeah. Balance that we need to roll over into an IRA. I'm thinking of taking an early distribution on $30,000 to pay off these cards. I understand that there's a 10% penalty, but getting rid of a $750 monthly payment would be great for our peace of mind. What do you think?</p><p>Love the show. Shout out Grand Rapids. My wife and I grew up in Western Michigan. Lots of Western Michigan shout outs. We're just blowing up here on the West side of the mitten. One of the things my father ingrained in my head from a young age, this is Ben's rule number one of personal finance.</p><p>I'm not a shouter. I don't pound the table much. Pay off your credit card balance every single month. That's it. We're talking 15% to 20% interest. John, give me a chart on the average credit card interest right here. I think it's close to 18% or something. It's ridiculously high.</p><p>This is an annual return that would make Buffett blush. There's no other expected return on investment that's going to do better for you than paying off your credit card debt. At the extremes, I think there's two types of credit card users. One, people who pay off their balance each month, and then they use a credit card for convenience or the ability to earn rewards.</p><p>This group just doesn't or shouldn't care about what the rates are. Two is people on the other extreme who pay the minimum balance, have a hard time paying it down, and accumulate more debt over time because that's a huge compounding rate against you. So I like the idea of using credit cards to earn rewards, maybe build up your credit score, but if you're paying the minimum, you're just falling behind every single month.</p><p>So you could do the cost benefit here of paying that 10% penalty. I'm guessing there's no benefit of not using that money to pay this off. So this person never really said how they got into credit card debt. That's probably maybe the first thing they should do after they pay it off.</p><p>It probably makes sense to consider how you got in a situation in the first place, but I'm guessing it'd be a huge relief to pay it off, especially if you're only making the minimums. But I would think long and hard about how you got into in the first place.</p><p>Was this a big one-time expense that you had to do to get into it? Or is this just budgetary problems where you made some bad choices or you had no other choice, but you just credit card debt? So paying it off is great, but if you just go back into debt, that's not going to help much.</p><p>You know what I've found is the average person really does not understand how credit cards work. And I don't even understand all the intricacies myself, and I've read quite a bit about it. But people do not understand the compounding aspect of credit card interest rates. Oh, no. I remember my sister, when she first got out of college, she said, "It's great.</p><p>I'm just putting all this stuff in my credit card, and all I have to pay is the minimum every month." And I said, "Yeah, that's all you have to pay, but do you realize how much money you're accruing?" She didn't realize that the debt grew on itself. She didn't know.</p><p>She had no idea. But this is the simple stuff where, yeah, you get rid of this, whatever you have to do, the Dave Ramsey snowball approach, whatever it is, get out from under it. And when are they going to bring these rates down? 27% or 24% interest rates on credit cards?</p><p>If credit card rates didn't come down with 0% interest rates, I think they just never are. I think it's just unsecured debt, and they're always going to have people default. I mean, before you pay it off, it's worth it to call your credit card company and say, "We're paying the minimums here.</p><p>Can you help us out a little bit?" Sometimes they could help you a little bit. They may laugh in your face and say, "No, pay it off," but it's worth asking. I'm kind of surprised that Elizabeth Warren hasn't gotten up in there and done something, you know? All right.</p><p>Let's do another one. Okay. Question three is from Miguel. "Big fan of all the shows. Thanks for the info you provide. I recently accumulated 100 shares of a couple of blue-chip stocks -- Apple, Disney, Google, and AMD. Is it a good idea for me to start selling covered calls on these stocks?" Covered calls are something we never got questions about until the bear market, basically.</p><p>Yes. It does seem like a bear market. Let's bring our favorite stock prognosticator on here, Mr. Josh Brown. Josh. Hey, Josh. Hey, guys. So great to be on my favorite show. Thank you, guys. Thanks for coming. And a new background. Josh, these are the kind of things -- I don't know if you know this.</p><p>This is actually a penitentiary behind me. It's a few snipers -- It does look like you have a prison yard behind you. This is 39th Street, and our office faces -- no, not 39th. What is this? I don't know. We're on 40th, right? 40th. We face 40th. No, that's 40th -- no, 40th is the front of the building.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, you're facing 40th. Okay, let me fix this. The western exposure of our headquarters looks over Bryant Park. So you see, right? But that's facing down 40th in the corner, and then behind us is 39th. It was nice of you to use your six minutes of sunlight to be with us today.</p><p>That was very nice. So, Duncan's right. Covered calls are a bear market phenomenon. No one talks about this when stocks are going up and we're in a bull market. But when stocks are going sideways or going down, people say, "This is a free lunch. I'm generating income on the shares I own.</p><p>What's the downside?" So do you ever dabble in options at all? I honestly don't. I think it's like an extra added layer of complexity. That's not for me. Some people swear by the income you can get. I think it just adds a layer of complexity that some people don't understand.</p><p>Yeah. As a retail broker, we did this, and we loved it because it was two commissions on the same trade. You would sell a guy a stock, and then you would sell him a covered call to "protect the stock." And then if he got called out, it was even better.</p><p>Then it's another commission, and then another commission because you have to buy a new stock, of course. So retail brokers loved selling option strategies to retail clients, but that's 20 years ago. So does this make sense for Miguel? I think no, because he said he's accumulated a couple of hundred shares.</p><p>So what is the covered call premium that you're able to bring in from selling those options contracts? I mean, we're talking about not a lot of money for a lot of annoyance, a lot of aggravation to not really bring in that much money. Because if you get called out of one of these stocks, meaning you bought it, it worked, the stock went higher, and it was called away from you at a lower price than where it is, then what do you do?</p><p>You buy it back, or you have to go find a new stock because you don't want to pay up for the stock you just lost. So I don't like it from that standpoint. Then there's tax consequences wrapped up in that as well. And then the other thing is, why are you buying them to begin with?</p><p>Is it a trade? If it's a trade, and you want to use options to risk manage the trade, all right, I suppose. But this sounds like when you say the word accumulate, it sounds like you're accumulating an investment. So why would you want to put a ceiling over the upside of those stock positions?</p><p>If you're going to be a long-term owner of these shares- Like I'm not sure what it accomplishes. Yeah. Get your income. In the same way. Last thing, in 0% interest rate land, yeah, you got to do some stuff to generate income. But you don't need that now. You can buy a six-month or a one-year T-bill, and you can generate current income and leave your stocks alone.</p><p>So I am anti that approach. And we've had people before reach out and say that there's ETFs you can get too. I would much prefer if you're going to do this and try to earn some option income, have a professional do it for you instead of trying to do it yourself.</p><p>Understanding the absolute premiums, and that's hard. There are covered call strategies that are now in an ETF wrapper. So if you want to make that part of your portfolio strategy, I think you can do that in a pretty low-cost way and not have to be logging in and checking options all day.</p><p>So look, if you're talking about a million-dollar position, and it's a company you worked for, and you can't sell it, and there's a huge tax liability, but you want to protect that position, options are a smart way to do that. But that doesn't sound like this is the scenario that Miguel is describing.</p><p>Yeah. It's not a free lunch. It sounds like it is, but it's not. There's so much more that goes into it. It's much work. You're accumulating shares. Yeah, it is. Keep it simple. Okay. I'm being told by Nicole to back up from my mic. Thank you. Is this good?</p><p>You guys can say it on the air. You don't have to hold up cue cards. Hey, we try to be professional around here, you know? What is this, The Tonight Show? Just say, "Josh, back off your mic." We're working on it. We're working on it. Okay. Up next, we have a question from Tom.</p><p>"I'm in my late 30s, so I know I should look at this environment as an opportunity to buy at lower prices, but I'm sick of the bear market." Me too. "I got caught up in investing, in tech in 2020 and 2021, so I'm down way more than the S&P 500, probably down 25% to 30% from my previous highs.</p><p>It would help to hear your best and worst case scenarios between new all-time highs this year and a 1970s environment where we go sideways for years." I can relate to this question because I'm kind of bored. It's getting boring. Well, I think the last three years have kind of taught people the wrong lessons, that they think everything is a top or a bottom, and everything has to be like we either go up really fast or down really fast.</p><p>It's hard to wrap your head around this. Most of the time, the stock market is somewhere in the middle. Just by sheer definition, the stock market can't always be at a top or a bottom. John, throw the chart up here. I looked at the new all-time highs by decades.</p><p>It's actually been a decent amount in the 2020s. This is a great chart. I think there's roughly 2,500 trading days per decade. So if you average this out, it's like, I don't know, 6% or 7% of the time that we hit a new all-time high. So it doesn't happen as often as you think to hit a new all-time high.</p><p>Even in the 1970s scenario where we had all this volatility and stuff, I think the stock market before inflation was still up 6% per year. So it's not like you went nowhere. It's a more volatile/boring market. I think people just want there to be an event that happens that, "Okay, we're back," or, "No, we're not," because we are kind of in the middle ground.</p><p>The stock market was down 25%. Now it's down, I don't know, 12% or 13%. So it does feel more boring, but maybe people should take that as a good thing. It's not always a bad thing that the stock market is not as volatile as it was the last few years.</p><p>So I had this conversation with my driver yesterday coming back from the airport. And he's talking about how frustrating the market is right now. And he wants it to go back to new high. First of all, the two words that you need to remove from your vocabulary is "boring" and "exciting." Neither one of those should have anything to do with investing.</p><p>That's one. Two, how old are you? Why do you want new all-time highs? Aren't you a buyer? Is this it? You're not going to buy a stock ever again? You bought tech stocks in 2021 and you're done? That doesn't seem likely. Are you 100 years old? So I actually don't understand why people can't...</p><p>I mean, I do understand. It took me a long time. I shouldn't say that. I think that people need to refocus their energy and what they get excited about, because we're all forced savers. My driver's young. This guy's younger than me. I don't understand. You're going to buy stocks next year, you want to pay up just so that the old stocks you bought are higher?</p><p>What does that do? Are you selling them all and living on the money right now? Probably not. So if you're not a seller, like you're an accumulator, you're a buyer, boring is great. Flat market is great. 1970s would be okay. It's not great for our lives, but we don't have control over what's going to happen.</p><p>The one thing that the 1970s were great for, and 2000 to 2009, which was also a lost decade, is that every 401(k) contribution you made, you were heavily rewarded for during the next bull market. You just had to wait. So if you're not using the money tomorrow, I don't know why you want all-time highs.</p><p>I think that's the biggest question. When do you need the money? And your point about the 70s, they didn't have 401(k)s back then. They didn't have the ability to invest a little bit of money out of every paycheck. And yeah, so having things... I know my retirement money is not going to be touched for, I don't know, 25, 30 years.</p><p>It's sure it's not fun to look up at what your account used to be worth and realize like, "Oh, it's worth less than that now." But long-run returns are the only ones that matter. Yeah, right. Listen, in an IRA, in a 401(k), you can't touch it. So what the hell do you want to...</p><p>And you're contributing more to it. So you want to buy your parents' stocks from them at record highs? I could see why they would like that. Why do you want that? Yes, exactly. So I think that's kind of where you have to come down on, is just understanding that if you have the ability to make 12 or 24 or however many purchases you're going to make out of your 401(k) or IRA this year, and the market just kind of goes nowhere.</p><p>And it is funny, though. People say the market's boring. The S&P is still up, I don't know, 7% this year. That's kind of a lot for not even halfway through the year. So I know it seems boring, but... You know what else is funny? All the commercials on the radio.</p><p>Like if you listen to Bloomberg Radio, CNBC Radio. So I often, when I'm driving, I'll listen to Sirius XM. All the commercials are like people selling, like the way they sell is they start the commercial with, "In today's volatile times." Dude, just today? They were rolling that years ago, too.</p><p>Yeah, back when... Yeah, every year. We've had less volatile years than this year, but we've had way more volatile years. We have a guy in West Michigan who's on all these billboards and he sells insurance and annuities, of course, and he's literally holding two safes on his arms. Like an actual safe.</p><p>Like, "I'm going to keep you safe from the stock market volatility." It's so gross. You're right. Can we get Ben a billboard? Let's get Ben a billboard in Michigan. We don't... That's not how we roll. We only do business with fans. We don't trick people with billboards. If you're a fan of ours, you can become a client or stay a fan.</p><p>You can't come in here through some bizarre channel where we put billboards up with a picture of a safe. Never make it through our process. I've got no slogans, Duncan. Sorry. Okay, okay. I tried. Last question. Okay. It was more fun, though, I have to say, when the market was going up every day.</p><p>I miss those days. Well, of course. Everyone feels better when the market's going up, but you should... Yeah. It's like, "Am I up 3% or 4% today?" No, I'm just kidding. Okay. So question five is from Frank. "My wife and I are 34 and we have very different views on finance.</p><p>She would rather take more trips and spend more now while I have a savers mindset and want to work towards early retirement. I enjoy the occasional trip each year, but not one each quarter. We also have a newborn on the way in two months. I'm of the mindset that we'll never be able to save enough, and that's based on my upbringing.</p><p>My wife's family did very well financially, so she's never seen the other side and what the struggles are like. I'd like to take more trips to make her happy, but I don't want to sacrifice early retirement. Should we lower our retirement savings rate in favor of more after-tax investing?</p><p>We could still save but have access to the money if we wanted to take these extra trips." All right, this is the kind of thing that... This is a relationship problem. Yeah. This is a psychologist kind of thing. I just got to get on the same page. Yeah. Have you read the Die With Zero book yet by Bill Perkins?</p><p>I haven't. You've heard this, Josh, or not? I know of it, but I haven't read it. Okay. He was a hedge fund manager, an energy trader. I don't agree with everything in it, but I think it's kind of eye-opening. His point is that you should be spending now so...</p><p>and not, say, waiting for the future. Just go for it, and your net worth should peak way sooner than you think. Your net worth shouldn't peak at 65. It should peak at, like, 50 and start spending it down. So that's one side of it. The other side is, how do you think about having a huge, like, just, like, philosophical disagreement with your significant other about how you should spend money, right?</p><p>Like, I don't... That seems like something that almost should be handled before you get into the relationship as opposed to during, because I don't know how you're going to change the fact that I'm a huge saver and you're a spender. Where do we meet in the middle? I think it works.</p><p>My wife and I are the opposite. Like, I get emails from, like, Madison Square Garden and Barclays and the UBS Arena, like, "This concert is happening." I'm like, "I'm buying it. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going." She's like, "What are you doing?" But we hash it out, and we end up at a reasonable compromise.</p><p>If it were up to me, I don't even know how much money we would have saved, not a lot. And I wouldn't... My attitude is I'll just go make more, because I'm insane. And I don't think about early retirement. I'm going to die doing this. Maybe today. Stay tuned, guys.</p><p>So, listen, if you're doing something that you hate, then early retirement maybe is a goal. But hopefully, that's not the case. And maybe that's the bigger issue, that you're so focused on stopping working that you're willing to go 30 years denying yourself things like family trips. And, like, in the end, like, what do you have to show for your life?</p><p>It's the moments that you remember forever. Like, we took the kids to the Caribbean, or we did a cruise. I don't do cruises, but we did a cruise. Or, like, those are the things that really matter when all is said and done. And so, if you're not doing those now, when do you want to do them?</p><p>I promise you, it doesn't become more fun when you're 60 or 70. Here's the thing, too. If you hold everything back now and retire at 55, you're not going to hit a switch when you turn 55 and all of a sudden be okay with spending. At that point, it's going to be even harder to turn this big around.</p><p>It's worse. Yeah, you're right. The compromise thing is part of it, to say, here's our travel budget per year. We're going to take either one really great trip or two smaller trips, whatever. You have to have some sort of compromise where you plan it out and put it into your budget and then figure out the saving from there.</p><p>But yeah, I'm a big proponent of -- I'm more of a balanced person. Yes, I'm a big saver, but you have to get those experiences out of the way once you -- I'm middle-aged now. I know that it's not going to last forever. Out of the way? No, you have to -- it's your life.</p><p>Out of the way. All right, we knocked that one off the list. What's next? Listen, I'm a planner. Hey, Seattle Michelle in the chat is pointing out -- I can't believe I've never noticed this before -- how much Duncan looks like The Edge from U2. The reason that's relevant is I'm going to be in Vegas in October for one day, like a business trip, and it happens to coincide with U2, they're doing a residence at The Sphere.</p><p>And The Sphere is -- Madison Square Garden opened this state-of-the-art entertainment destination on The Strip, and I think U2 is the opening thing for it. So I'm just trying to get sprinkles to buy a ticket and come with me, and let's go see U2 at The Sphere. And she's like, "Yeah, but we have to take our daughter to see two more colleges." And I'm just like, "Yeah, but when is this ever going to happen again?</p><p>I happen to be in Vegas for something cool like this." So that balance, I'm not saying I'm always right or she's always right, but you have to have those conversations. And so maybe this is less a financial question, it's more like a relationship question. And maybe you should just leave her.</p><p>No, I'm not saying that. My wife and I are kind of similar. My wife, she'll spend on a lot of the small stuff and not think about it. When it comes to big stuff, she's like, "I don't know if we should get this." And I'm kind of the opposite.</p><p>It's the little stuff that kills me for some reason, but the big stuff, I don't mind about. So it is this balancing act where I think it's good to have some give and take, but then you have to figure out what's the middle ground and what are your limitations you're putting on any of it.</p><p>And also, John, we need a side-by-side of Duncan and The Edge, because that's a great call. Oh, man. It's nice to see that Frank is empathetic here, right? Frank is trying to think about her side of the situation and trying to do right by her and not just be like, "We have to save every dollar." And we've had questions from people talking about spending tons of money on joining a country club or something, right?</p><p>To me, something like taking trips is probably something that is going to enrich your life more. I don't know. I've never... Yeah, as long as you're not wasting your money on handbags. Yeah. It's situational, because where I live, or not really my town, but on the north shore of Long Island, the country club becomes the center of your social life.</p><p>It's where you meet with your friends every weekend. The guys play cards, you golf with your wife and another couple, and then your kids grow up with the kids of the other families, and it becomes like... I thought that was Starbucks. No, no. It becomes a community. So I think it's a walk of life question also, when you're like, you can't just be like, "I'm not a country club guy.</p><p>I have five seconds of attention for golf." But I'm saying that question, like, "Is this a good use of money? Is that a good use of money?" What's the context? What does it mean for your life and the experiences you're going to have? Do the people you care about, are they into that shit?</p><p>Because then maybe that is the right way to spend money. So these are very rarely boiled down to a nickel and dime financial question.
