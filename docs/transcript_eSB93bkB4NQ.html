I mean, your face is like right up in it. We can see your bloodshot eyes. Oh God. It's really unbelievable. 9 a.m. start time. It's a little rough on Jacob. It's a little rough on Jacob. That's true. I want my second cup of coffee already.</p><p>This is a lifestyle choice we may regret. Let your winners ride. Rain Man, David Sasson. And it's said we open source it to the fans. And they've just gone crazy with it. Love you, besties. Queen of Kinwa. I'm going all in. Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the All In podcast.</p><p>It's Saturday morning. It's ridiculously early, but we're taping the show because one of the besties happens to have left the continent with us from an undisclosed location, Chamath Palihapitiya. Are you in a wine cellar or in catacombs? I am in. I am in. Wait for it. Wait for it.</p><p>Wait for it. Wait for it. Wow. Were you able to see that or no? No. What was that? Are you in the cathedral somewhere? You mean the ceiling of your room? It's incredible. You paid for the four walls, and now you can afford the roof? Fantastic. Okay, hold on.</p><p>Hold on. Okay, hold on. I'll do a little. Let's see if you can just see outside and get a sense of the view. Oh, you can't. Oh, no, it's hard. We can't. We can't. Just pause for a second. Oh! Whoa. Hold on a second. And then the-- Oh, no, that's my architect.</p><p>Hold on. Look at this. Wow. I'm going to go out here. I love how the house is already built, and he's still paying the architect. Yeah. He's like, "Do me a favor. This came out great, but can you rip down these four rooms and then just start over?" All right.</p><p>Well, we lost Bestie C as he walks around his castle in some European country. Welcome to Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. What time is it there for you? Well, it's six in the afternoon--six in the evening. I was in London last week, and holy mackerel. The weather--if you want to see climate change, spend some time in Europe because literally day over day, London on the first day I landed was--call it 24 degrees Celsius, so whatever that is, 80, 78 maybe.</p><p>Beautiful. Literally, the next day, it was 62 and raining, and it just kept bouncing back and forth. It is the weirdest thing. And if you're in Europe right now, you just see some of the craziest weather patterns, day over day, massive thundershowers, then it's completely normal. I mean, no wonder everybody here takes climate change so seriously.</p><p>You actually feel it every day. And with us as well, David Sachs is here, the Rain Man himself tearing up the Twitter. We've been off for two weeks, so there's a lot to cover. And, of course, the queen of quinoa, chairman of the production board, David Friedberg. Right off the bat, I think we got to go science and get the Friedberg ratio up from the get.</p><p>Let's go with the Friedberg. I'm going to go with the Friedberg. I'm going to go with the Friedberg.
