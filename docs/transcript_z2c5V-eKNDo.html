So any of us, if we look at what we wanted 10 years ago and what we wanted 20 years ago, what our priorities were, what our values were, it's very easy to identify ways that you have become more mature, that you've just changed your thinking on things, but it is much harder to recognize that you are very likely to continue to evolve in what your preferences are and what your priorities are going forward.</p><p>But I think just this humility to recognize that you are likely to continue to change. And I think one of the things there is you can't know exactly how you'll change, but if you look at people who are further along in the journey, you certainly see common patterns on how people tend to evolve, and so try to learn from those.</p></div></div></body></html>
