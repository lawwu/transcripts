Just like big, massive amounts of urbanization, a lot of like really interesting buildings and construction. I mean, just in terms of like raw output, right?</p><p>I would also put like Japan in like the late 20th century on there, basically at the peak of like concern, like wonder, like, is Japan gonna take over the world? And they, you know, they were really interested in building their stuff quite quickly. They spent a lot of time and effort trying to use their like robotics expertise to try to figure out how to build buildings a lot more quickly.</p><p>So they had these like really interesting factories that were designed to basically extrude an entire skyscraper just going up vertically.</p></div></div></body></html>
