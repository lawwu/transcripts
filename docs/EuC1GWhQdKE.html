up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Electricity, this amazing new force,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is all the rage in the

claiming that it's going to change everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, something very interesting happened around this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Or rather, it didn't happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You see, despite electricity's obvious superiority in comparison to the traditional techniques at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like steam engines, it didn't immediately improve manufacturing productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, because factory owners were simply trying to replace their old technology with this new technology into an outdated paradigm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's picture a typical factory at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a huge coal-fired steam engine on one end, and we have a network of transmission lines going across the top,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">all driving hundreds of machines locked in the same rhythm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">These legacy steam power factories were incredibly inefficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if one station needed power, all of a sudden you had to turn on that entire steam engine and it had to power all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Factory layouts were dictated by the limitations of the transmission lines, not by what was best for the process or for the workers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">When electricity arrived, many factory owners simply swapped out the steam engine for an electric one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And sure, you know, they added some lights and, you know, workers didn't have to toil next to a coal-fired furnace all day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But the fundamental limitations of the factory remained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this real electrical revolution, well, it didn't actually come until we imagined factories from the ground up with electricity at its core.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Factories started to become flexible and adaptable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">They allowed for smaller, specialized tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Workers could bring their tools to the items instead of having to lug the items back to their workstations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The entire manufacturing process became more efficient, more humane, and more productive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let's fast forward 140-something years to today, and you can see that we find ourselves at a similar point in regards to AI and LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Enterprises, startups, developers are all building and integrating LLMs into their products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But often, they're just tacking it onto their existing product surface, adding a few star icon buttons in the top left corner, and calling it a day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is not the first time we've seen this in Silicon Valley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's think back to when mobile first emerged, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Companies simply tried to just shrink down their website and put it on a phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't until we redesigned apps from the ground up with the unique capabilities of mobile, like always-on camera and GPS,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that we actually began to see true innovation in the space and adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This is when the Snapchats and the Ubers of the world started to emerge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just as companies and just as factories went through their, you know, replaced steam engines with electric one phase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and tech companies went through their just-hire-a-couple mobile web dev people phase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we're now in our magic star icon phase with respect to AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, it's funny, but the thing is you can't blame any of the companies or developers that are actually trying to do this right now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, all of us are trying to do this, but in many ways, we're just still so early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs are non-deterministic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">They're hard to build on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They're completely different than what most developers are used to using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Reliability is still an issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Prompts still take rounds and rounds of optimization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've also just started to scratch the surface of potential product opportunities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So far, not much has really stuck beyond just the text box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We've been missing something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Something that's a little hard to put a finger on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But just last week, I think we scratched the surface of a potential new product feature that we can build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">As some of you may have heard, last Thursday, we released our new model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">3.5 Sonnet is the first model that we released in the new Claude 3.5 family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's only the middle model, and yet it is better than our last best model, Claude 3 Opus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In my opinion, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is one of the best models in the world right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And the benchmarks seem to back it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">MMLU, human eval, GPQA, tool use, all the common characters here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's top of its class in many regards in these academic lab-type environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I am most excited for is how it actually does in the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The model is particularly strong in RAG use cases, thanks to its 200K context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It also has near-perfect recall over that entire context as well.</span></div><div

problems better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not getting stuck in those same loops as much as previous models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the best methods that we've found for actually measuring more complicated chains of reasoning is pull requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They have a defined task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They usually take a few steps to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the model is able to iteratively write and test its way to a solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">In our own internal pull request evals, we're seeing that Claude 3.5 Sonnet scores a 64%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And to put that number in comparison, Claude 3 Opus only scored a 38%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">3.5 Sonnet also has state-of-the-art vision abilities.</span></div><div

also released a new product feature that I think is actually more inspiring to developers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of thinking about and building those AI products from the ground up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called Artifacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Artifacts separate the content that Claude produces from the actual chat dialogue itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This allows you to work collaboratively with Claude on things from essays to SVGs to React websites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Artifacts become really powerful when you combine it with 3.5 Sonnet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Those coding skills plus that reasoning ability plus that strong visual acuity enables a new product experience that's really fun to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also a developer's best friend in that it allows you to quickly take screenshots and figma diagrams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and quickly turn it into code and components that you can actually just go use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">As you can see in this, I basically cloned our entire Claude AI chat layout in React just from a single screenshot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And this feature has practically been hiding in plain sight now, just waiting really to be discovered for over a year and a half.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe this tweet is right, and we really are early on this S-curve of productionizing LLMs, which I think is actually pretty inspiring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And Artifacts is not the only AI feature that we launched recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">On Tuesday, we released Projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Projects enables dev teams to work and collaborate much more efficiently by grounding Claude's outputs in your own knowledge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's style guides or code bases or transcripts or even your past work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">On our Claude team plan, you can even share these projects in your chats with all your teammates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">At Anthropic, our engineers now upload code repos and documentation that they use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've started to see people actually just share the chats and the artifacts instead of Google Docs or site documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Projects is another great example of when you think from an LLM and an AI standpoint first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you can actually start to build product experiences that complement these technologies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and don't feel like a simple add-on to what you already have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So now that hopefully the creative product juices are flowing in everyone's minds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to dive a little bit into API improvements that we've rolled out recently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and things that allow you to actually build this cool stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I also want to give a preview of what's coming next that will enable you to build even more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So a month ago, we released our new Tool Use API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Tool Use allows you to give Claude custom client-side functions that it can then intelligently leverage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Tool Use also enables things like consistent structured JSON output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">With 3.5 Sonnet, I've actually started to see devs give Claude hundreds of tools at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">On the developer console front, we're also continuing to iterate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We added a prompt generator that uses Claude to write prompts for you based on a task description.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see in this video, we put in a task description, and then out comes an optimized prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once that prompt is all done, you can actually just start editing it right in the workbench itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see we've also added support for variables, so you can edit prompt templates as well, test things like RAG use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, we're also working on a new Evaluate feature, which is currently in console right now with a beta tag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we will plan to share more on this and continue to iterate on it very soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So what else is next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there's two things that I can share right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">First is that you can expect more models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">3.5 Haiku and 3.5 Opus are coming later this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With each model generation, we're looking to increase the intelligence, decrease the latency, and decrease the cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The number one thing that I tell developers is to not forget to build with that in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Models will become smarter, cheaper, and faster in orders of months, not years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're planning your product roadmap, be ambitious enough to build with the belief that new models may arrive during your development period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We are also working on other areas of research like interpretability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In one of our latest papers called Scaling Mono-Semanticity, we explained how we've been able to find features within models that activate for different topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you identify a feature, you're able to clamp its value and turn it up or down to actually steer the model's outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">A few weeks ago, we showed Cloud.ai users how this worked through GoldenGate Cloud, which was a version of Cloud that had the GoldenGate bridge feature turned up significantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, fan favorite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We currently have a few beta testers also experimenting with a steering API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This allows developers to find and clamp features for specific attributes and actually turn that dial up or down, which, again, allows you to control Cloud's outputs in addition to actually just prompting it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We hope to be able to roll this out to more developers in the very near future as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if anything in this talk has sparked any ideas, I want to encourage you guys to just go out there and build and make quick prototypes as fast as you can to get that validation and that feedback loop started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And for even more of an incentive, we actually just launched another build with Cloud contest yesterday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It runs until July 10th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The top three projects will each receive 10K in Anthropic API credits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
