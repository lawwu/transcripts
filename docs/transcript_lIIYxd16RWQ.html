So I think they're going to screw up a lot of historical relationships in the years ahead. I think that part of it is going to be bizarre.</p><p>But then they have the offsetting millennials that are just as big as they are. We're getting into middle age these days. So that shift, I think, is interesting. I've just been having talks with people that I think the need for financial advice in the years ahead is going to be greater than anything we've ever seen.</p><p>Because again, you have all these people who did the DIY thing and saved and invested and they did just fine on their own. And then they realize in retirement, okay, now I'm really on my own. I'm in the water with no life raft. I don't have any income coming in anymore.</p><p>I'm just living on this portfolio. I have to think about taxes and withdrawal rates and what happens to my family and estate planning. And God forbid, something should happen to me. I'm the one who's been dealing with the finances. What happens to my spouse or my kids if something should happen to me?</p></div></div></body></html>
