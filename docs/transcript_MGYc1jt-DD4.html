Investing is so personal, and the right strategy depends on your situation, your risk tolerance, your long-term objectives, and a lot more. I sat down with Tad Fallows, who started this group called Long Angle, which is a private network for high-net-worth investors, and I got to attend their summit.</p><p>We talked about the 10 lessons we took away from the conference, and it was so interesting that, despite that there were so many people, so smart, focused on investing, there was no one right answer. And even in the sessions where different types of alternative investments were being presented and shared, there was no perfect answer between those either, and it wasn't just that diversification was the only answer.</p><p>It depended on how important liquidity was to you, how much risk you wanted to take on, how interested you were in exploring the topic, because some types of investments take a lot of time and energy and education. That was one really big takeaway for me, because I think I've always been hearing, "Oh, real estate's amazing, let's chase that.</p><p>"Oh, this is awesome, private credit, angel investing." And you could chase that strategy of trying to find the best thing, but the reality is everyone is different, everyone has different ideas.</p></div></div></body></html>
