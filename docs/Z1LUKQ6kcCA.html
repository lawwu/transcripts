So, just mark it down as sin is being redefined today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I have some notes on your handout there that in the world of secular psychology, sin is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">redefined as a disorder or a syndrome. Here are some ways that sin is being redefined. Letter A,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">some say sin is a lack of self-esteem.

This is on the slide here. He says, "Allow me to tell you who you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really are.

So, this is the new reformation. On your handout, you have letter B, "Sin as a disease</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">model." We no longer have sins that need to be repented of. We have disorders that need to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">managed.

He said, "Has no one committed any sins? Where indeed did sin go? What became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of it?" Now, when an unbeliever is saying, "What happened to the doctrine of sin?" you know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to take care to rearticulate the doctrine and understand it for our own lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have letter C on your handout, the victimization model. "I'm not a sinner. I'm a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">victim." This starts all the way back in the garden. Adam said, "The woman whom you gave me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree, and I ate." Adam was basically saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"It's not my fault, God, that I ate the fruit. It's the woman's fault, and it's not her fault,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">God. It's really your fault because you're the one who gave me the woman. It's everyone's fault,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but mine." And you see that dynamic being played out in so many people today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the victim model. "I'm not a sinner. I'm not responsible. I'm a victim." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we could say much more about that, but let me move on. Sin is being redefined,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and when you redefine sin, you redefine the gospel.

"The Doctrine of Original Sin." Anthony Hokema defines the doctrine of original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sin in this way, "Original sin is the sinful state and condition in which every human is born."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"Original sin is the sinful state and condition in which every human is born."

But the doctrine of original sin says that my sin is related to the original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LUKQ6kcCA&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">root of the human race, which is Adam.
