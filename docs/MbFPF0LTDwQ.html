respond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to the request, there isn't this

target="_blank">00:01:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just think it's an interesting dynamic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's obviously not one that people can pre-program themselves for, but I do think it's an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">dynamic as opposed to what you're describing where emotions can kind of ratchet together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like gears, and that can be wonderful when people are in, you know, ecstatic states or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">happy or that there's like the banter of certain couples that seem pretty emotive is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm also familiar with observing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But those couples also seem like more volatile, like when somebody is upset, the other person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">gets upset that they're, and it just starts to deteriorate pretty quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want two highly reactive people to be together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You also, I think, need to think about, there's a saying, we marry our unfinished business, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say that there's somebody who had a parent who was very kind of avoidant or withdrawn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That person, if they haven't processed that, will be drawn to the partner who is more avoidant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but not because it feels good, but because it's familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so sometimes in the kind of couple that you're describing, and I don't know the experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of your friends, but I've seen a lot of couples where it looks like that would be a good match</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">because one person is, you know, sort of more in the emotional sphere and one person is less so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes what that is, is one person gets very lonely because they're not really getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of emotional interaction that they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can be a solution for some people because they don't know how to be with a different kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">of person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also feel like you want to make sure that you have figured out your unfinished business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're not just, you don't just have radar for the kind of person who hurt you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So what often happens is people haven't processed whatever it was that they wanted more of or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">less of when they were growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they go out into the world and they're looking for a partner and they literally have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">radar for a person who is exactly like the person who hurt them, but doesn't look like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like, I'm going to choose someone who is the opposite of the parent who hurt me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you find this person and after you get to know them a little bit, you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">wow, that person drinks a lot too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't realize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or that person is really withholding too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't see that at first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Or that person yells a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't notice that at first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're like, how did I get into this exact situation that hurt me as a child?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because your unconscious is saying, you look familiar, come closer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what we're trying to do is we're trying to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We're trying to master a situation where we felt helpless as a child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We couldn't control the situation with our parents when we were growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we think, again, this is completely outside of our awareness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to win this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to master this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to get love from that kind of person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it doesn't work out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that you really want to make sure that you are choosing someone for healthy reasons and not because there's some unfinished business that you're trying to work out with this person who is not going to meet your needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">To go a little bit further into this idea, which, by the way, I fully subscribe to, based on your explanation of this and my belief that our unconscious mind is driving a lot of our choices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">My understanding is that what you just described doesn't adhere to mom, dad, male, female compartmentalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by that is that I think a lot of people will hear what you just said and assume, okay, if my dad hurt me in the following ways, then let's say it's a woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said, you know, my dad hurt me in the following ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe he was a drinker, withdrawn, or he was violent or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But if her mother was the one that was the drinker, violent, and or withdrawn, and she's heterosexual, my understanding is, based on the dynamics that you describe, if she will find those traits in a man because she's heterosexual, she's seeking men for romantic partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that sometimes we put the mom-dad labels on top of the attraction to, again, staying in the heterosexual framework here, the opposite sex framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then people say, well, why is it that this woman always seeks out these, like, what ended up being really terrible guys?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

people think that having one parent that gave you what you needed is protective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some ways it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing that hurts is the thing that gets the most attention inside of our bodies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't necessarily think it, but we felt it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We internalized it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It lives inside of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yes, having a good parent, one of the two, if you have two parents, one of the two is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's interesting that it's not like we seek out the person that's like the good parent always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes, again, because we're trying to work something out, we seek out someone like the parent who really hurt us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's such a flaw in our wiring.</span></div><div

helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's where, you

| <span class="t">And I think it's really about what are the things that are outside of your awareness but that are sort of driving the car?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like we think we're the driver of our own car, but often, like, someone else is driving the car and we don't realize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.400</a></span> | <span

personally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so often it's because there's some force that you are acting out that you don't even realize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the role of therapy is to kind of hold up a mirror to people and help them to see something about themselves that they haven't been willing or able to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You said that people will pick the person who's exactly wrong for them, who feels exactly right, at least at first, that it has this kind of come here, this summoning aspect to it.</span></div><div

hope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But in this case, you said that people come to find that that person is exact, harbors some of the exact same traits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm calling them that, behaviors, traits, you know, whatever it is that hurt them in the context of their child-parent relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do you think initially it presents as the opposite?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.780</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if childhood was not optimal or even miserable, it still feels familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And humans in general are very afraid of uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They're very afraid of the unfamiliar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember when I was in therapy, my therapist said to me, you know, you remind me of this cartoon, and it's of a prisoner shaking the bars, desperately trying to get out.</span></div><div

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So why do we stay in this prison?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Why don't we walk?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Why don't we even see that it's open?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And why don't we walk around the

comes responsibility and uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.500</a></span> | <span

now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't blame it on mom or dad or this situation or that situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so once she sort of works that through, by the end of the therapy, she became

a guy like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFPF0LTDwQ&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm not really
