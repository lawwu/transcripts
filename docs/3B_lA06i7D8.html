I'm sure he has millions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of sub-goals and sub-purposes in everything he does.

Most of those goals and purposes are hidden from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">us, but what has he revealed as his main or his ultimate purpose? Where's everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going? That's the question that has burned in me ever since I was 22 years old and became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a lover of the all-ordaining, all-planning God. And then the next question becomes, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if I could discern what his ultimate goal was, how can I join him in it? I want to fit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in to his ultimate purpose. I don't want to strive against it. I want to be right in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">sync with what God is pursuing in the world. Nothing seems more obviously reasonable to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">me or hopeful to me than that God's creatures should gladly fit into his purposes." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">surely that's his call on us. That's what he's beckoning us to do. "Find my purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Join me in it." So that's my second question then. Is there a way I can join the purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of God once I have found out what his ultimate purpose is? And then the question becomes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how do I do everything I am doing so that I help that ultimate goal come about or so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that I can be used by God to make it come about? I want everything, not just a few things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but everything I do to somehow contribute to that purpose. So that's why mission statements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">seem helpful to me. They keep me focused on the great things of life. But let me caution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">us here. I think the particularities of life are too variable for our mission statement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to be very detailed. I know our friend asked that it not be too general, and yet I might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">disappoint him because I find big, big general purposes really helpful if they're the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">kind.

You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">change, your job changes, you have kids, you get sick, you move.

So if you want your mission statement to last more than a few years, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">will need to be high-level and general, and that's mainly what I have in mind when I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of my own statements that guide my life.

And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B_lA06i7D8&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible seems—that is, "How can I live that way?
