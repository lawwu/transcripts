And they were trying to get people to take out, it was a whole internal presentation about how you got someone to take out a risky mortgage when what they really wanted was the same 30 year fixed rate mortgage that their, that their parents had had, and it was all the tactics and tips you could use to twist their arm to take out this, this riskier mortgage, because those are the ones that were in demand to be packaged up into subprime mortgage backed securities.</p><p>And so Walmart could turn around and sell those mortgages for more money to Wall Street than they could the fake 30 year fixed rate mortgages. And then I remember thinking, there's just something wrong with a world where all of the responsibility is on consumers to understand, and none of the responsibility is on the people selling the product.</p></div></div></body></html>
