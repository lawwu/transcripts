And there were hundreds, there may have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">thousands of them. And so they had uncovered really this enormous library is the only library</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ever to have sort of survived in any form, even though it was badly damaged.

And so to find underground hundreds of definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not in good condition, but still present, you know, papyrus scrolls were on a few of them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can make out the lettering was like this enormous discovery. People immediately in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">well-meaning attempt to read them started trying to open them.

And so hundreds were destroyed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">People did things like cut them with daggers down the middle.

And a typical scroll,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, could be 15 or 20 or 30 feet long, and managed to successfully unroll a few of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they found on them, Greek philosophical texts in the Epicurean tradition by this little known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">philosopher named Philodemus. But we got kind of new text from antiquity, which is not a thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">happens all the time. Eventually, people stopped trying to physically unroll these things because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so many were destroyed. And in fact, some attempts to physically unroll the scrolls continued even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">into like the 2000s, like 1990s, 2000s, and, and they were destroyed. So the current situation is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we have 600 plus kind of roughly intact scrolls that we can't open. And I heard, I heard about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this, and I thought that was incredibly exciting, like the idea that there was information from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">2000 years in the past, we don't know what's in these things. And obviously, people are trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to develop new ways and new technologies to open them. And I read about a professor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">at the University of Kentucky, Brent Seals, who had been trying to scan these using increasingly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">advanced imaging techniques, and then use computer vision techniques and machine learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of virtually unroll them without ever opening them. And they tried a lot of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">things. But their most recent attempt in 2019 was to take the scrolls to a particle accelerator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in Oxford, England, called the Diamond Flight Source, and to make essentially an incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">high resolution CT scan of the sort of 3D x-ray scan. And they needed really high energy photons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in order to do this, and they were able to take scans at eight microns, so these really quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">tiny voxels, which they thought would be sufficient. And I thought this was like the coolest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">thing ever. You know, we're using technology to sort of read this lost information from the past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and I sort of waited for the news that they had been decoded successfully. So that was, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">2020. And then I think COVID hit, everybody got a little bit slowed down by that. And last year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I found myself wondering, I wonder what happened to, you know, Dr. Seals and his scroll project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I reached out, and it turned out they'd been making really good progress. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they'd gotten some machine learning models to start to identify ink inside of the scrolls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but they hadn't yet extracted words or passages. It's very challenging. And I invited him to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">out to California and hang out, and to my shock, he did. And we got to talking and decided to team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">up and try to crack this thing. And the approach that we've settled on to do that is to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">launch an open competition. We're going to, we've done a ton of work with his team to get the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">into a shape where, and the tools and techniques and just the broad understanding of the materials</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">into a shape where smart people can kind of approach it and get productive easily. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm putting up together with Daniel Gross, a prize, you know, sort of like an X prize or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like that for the first person or team who can actually read like substantial amounts of real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">text from one of these scrolls without opening them. And so we're launching that this week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I guess maybe it's when, when this airs, I don't know. The stakes are kind of big,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like this, like what gets me excited are the stakes. So the six or 800 scrolls that are there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's estimated that if we could read all of them and, you know, somehow the technique works and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">generalizes to all the scrolls, then that would give us approximately a doubling of the total</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">text that we have from antiquity. This is what historians and classicists tell me. So it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, oh, we would get like a 5% bump or a 10% bump in the total ancient Roman or Greek text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be like, no, we get all of the texts that we have. Again, you know, multiple Shakespeare's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is sort of one of the units that I've heard. So, so that, that would be significant. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't know what's in there. You know, we've got a few Philodemus texts. Those are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of some interest, but there could be lost epic poems or God knows what. So I'm really excited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, my bet is there's like a 50% chance that someone will encounter this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity and get the data and get nerd sniped by it. And we'll solve it this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I want to make tangible, like what could be gained if we can unwrap these?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you said there's a few more thousand scrolls. Are we talking about the ones in a Philodemus's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">layer? Are we talking about the ones in other layers? You know, you'd think if you find this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy Villa that was owned by Julius Caesar's father-in-law that we just like dig the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">thing out. Um, but in fact, most of the exploration occurred in the 1700s through the Swiss engineers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tunnels underground. So it was never, the Villa was never dug out and exposed to the air.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You went down 50, 60 feet and then you dig tunnels. And, you know, again, they were looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for treasure, not like a full archeological exploration. So they mostly got treasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">In the nineties, some additional excavations were done kind of at the edge of the Villa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And they discovered a couple of things. First, they discovered this, like it was a seaside Villa</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that faced the ocean. It was right on the water before the volcano erupted. The eruption actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pushed the shoreline out by depositing so much additional mud there. So it's no longer right by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the ocean, apparently. I've actually never been. And they also found that there were two additional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">floors in the Villa that the tunnels apparently had never excavated. And so at most, a third of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the Villa has been excavated. Now they also know when they were discovering these papyrus scrolls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that they found basically one little room where most of the scrolls were. And these were mostly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">these Philodemus texts, at least that's what we know. And they found apparently several revisions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes at the same text. And so they think the hypothesis is this was actually Philodemus's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">working library. He worked here, this sort of Epicurean philosopher. And in the hallways though,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they occasionally found other scrolls, including crates of them. And the belief is, at least this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is what historians have told me, and I'm no expert, but what they have told me is they think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that the main library in this Villa has probably not been excavated. And that the main library may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">be a Latin library and may contain literary texts, historical texts, other things. And that it could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">be much larger. Now I don't know how prone these classicists are to wishful thinking. It is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">romantic idea, but they have some evidence in the presence of these partly evacuated sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">scrolls that were found in hallways and that sort of thing. So there are descriptions. I've since</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">gone and read a bunch of the first-hand accounts of the excavations. And there are these heartbreaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">descriptions of them finding an entire case of scrolls in Latin and accidentally destroying it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">as they tried to get it out of the mud. And there were maybe 30 scrolls or something in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vguhnSgc9Y&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there clearly was some other stuff that we just haven't got to.</span></div></div></body></html>
