Praise YAH. Praise YHWH from the heavens. Praise Him in the heights. Praise Him all His angels. Praise Him all His hosts. Praise Him sun and moon. Praise Him all stars of light. Praise Him heavens of heavens and the waters that are above the heavens.</p><p>Let them praise the name of YHWH, for He commanded and they were created. He caused them to stand forever and ever. He gave a statute and it will never pass away. Praise YHWH from the earth, sea monsters in all deeps, fire and hail, snow and clouds, stormy wind, doing His word, mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars, beast and all cattle, creeping things and winged bird, kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth, both choice men as well as virgins, the old with the young.</p><p>Let them praise the name of YHWH, for His name alone is set on high. His splendor is above earth and heaven, and He has raised up a horn for His people. Praise for all His holy ones, for the sons of Israel, a people near to Him. Praise YAH. 1 1</p></div></div></body></html>
