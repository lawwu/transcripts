And I wonder for people in their 20s, if they like shouldn't go to San Francisco. I feel San Francisco, the entrepreneurs are held in excessively high regard in my view. And look, I guess I like entrepreneurs.</p><p>There is a set of career paths that I think some set of people ought to pursue and would derive most fulfillment from pursuing that are really valuable for the world if pursued, that require accumulating a lot of expertise and really studying a domain in tremendous depth. And I think San Francisco valorizes, and look, this is also San Francisco's great virtue.</p><p>San Francisco valorizes a kind of striking out on your own, iconoclastically dismissing the sort of received wisdom and the founding archetypes and lore of the Steve Jobs and the Bill Gates and all the rest. And I'm way less successful than those people, but to some extent Stripe, in as much as it fits a pattern, is an instance of that pattern.</p><p>And look, that's great. And I'm kind of happy that that phenomenon exists in the world, but the world needs lots of other things, right? And I don't think San Francisco particularly, I mean, I'm again using San Francisco as a kind of metonym for a cultural orientation, but I think that San Francisco doesn't really encourage the pursuit of really deep technical depth.</p><p>And we're recording this in South San Francisco, most noteworthy in the corporate world for of course being the headquarters of Genentech, co-founded by Bob Swanson and Herb Boyer. And they produced cheap insulin for the first time with recombinant DNA. Herb Boyer couldn't have done that at age 23. Herb Boyer first had to accumulate all of the knowledge and the skills required to be able to invent that over the course of a multi-decade career.</p><p>And then, I don't know what age he was when he finally went and invented it, but he was not in his 20s. And I feel San Francisco perhaps doesn't culturally encourage one to become Herb Boyer. I don't quite know how to synthesize it yet, but as I think about advice for people in their 20s, look, I'm not going to normatively pretend or presume to know kind of in which direction one should go in one's life.</p><p>And obviously there are successful examples of basically every strategy. And I'm really glad that you're doing what you're doing at what age? 23. 23. So that's- Wait, a podcast isn't. I'm not inventing recombinant DNA here. Look, I think information dissemination is a really valuable thing in the world. Anyway, I don't presume to know what people should do with their lives, obviously, but I wonder in as much as I'm trying to give advice, and especially maybe if they're reading my advice and not someone else's advice, maybe they're kind of thinking about career paths that look sort of directionally like mine.</p><p>I think my advice might be, maybe you should do something like what I did or I'm trying to do, but there are other paths as well. And I think a lot of really important invention in the world and a lot of the things that I'm most happy are happening actually require a very different trajectory.</p><p>And I think there were counterfactual versions of my life where I pursued that path and well, who knows how well it would have worked. So what practically does that look like to hone your craft in any of these disciplines that take a long time? I mean, you've spoken and tweeted about some of the problems with modern universities.</p><p>Is that still the de facto path if you want to be the great biologist that Ark hires or something? In many domains, I don't know, right? So in hardware, which is not a small domain, most things in the world involve stuff and things, and I just have no facility with or experience with doing things in hardware.</p><p>And so if you want to become like a super skilled practitioner there, what's the best career path? I don't know. Maybe it's to drop out and join SpaceX or something. I'm not necessarily endorsing just pursuing the most establishment and credential-oriented path. I think people should try to find the gradient of maximal learning in whatever it is they care most about.</p><p>For biology, look, not that I'm a biologist, but it is very clear that in order to do really good work, there are a lot of bench skills one has to acquire, and then there just is a lot of actual specific knowledge. There are very few successful pure autodidacts in biology where you, at some point, in virtually every case that I'm aware of, have to have had direct experience in and with a top lab where you're seeing how people actually do it in practice.</p><p>I think software is different to many other domains where you can learn a very significant fraction of the craft and the practice while being sort of a dog online and just kind of watching other people do it. In software, more of it just takes place in a remotely consumable fashion.</p><p>You can watch the factory, so to speak, through open source and mailing lists and GitHub and things like that in a way that I think isn't the case for pharmacology or for sophisticated manufacturing or for semiconductors. Maybe one version of what people in the '20s should do is get some ideas to domains you're interested in or care about, but then figure out where can you learn the highest standards, where are the highest standards embodied, and where can you go and experience that firsthand?</p></div></div></body></html>
