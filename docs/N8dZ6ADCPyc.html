I'm sure that every single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">industry has its own hype merchants. It's just that in a field as important to the future as AI, I don't want you guys or anyone to fall into the extremes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The extremes being that every new development is just one click away from automating everyone's job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and the other extreme being that AI is just all hype and there's just literally no substance there at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Just quickly though while we're on this particular Gaia benchmark which was written in part by Jan LeCun,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">famously a skeptic of LLMs, I and perhaps you are quite impressed by these scores compared to OpenAI Deep Research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is it is a public benchmark so we are slightly reliant on trust that they didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">over optimize to game essentially the benchmark. For example, because the answers are public, you could keep training your model and optimizing it until it reached a certain bar on this particular benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">For the few of you who haven't actually heard of Manus AI, what is it and what does it do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's a bit like a combination of OpenAI's Operator and Deep Research systems. Think of Operator as an agent that can take actions on your computer, it can click things and indeed book restaurants, do that kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Operator can be fairly cumbersome though and require a lot of babysitting where it'll do one thing at a time and then ask you another question. In contrast, Deep Research, after clarifying your query, will go off and search, in this case, 37 sources in 14 minutes and produce a comprehensive output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Deep Research in particular, I think is great, but the reason that Operator and Deep Research aren't particularly popular or terribly widespread is that until very recently, they were limited to the $200 tier called the pro tier from OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The final bit of context comes from Claude Projects, which you may or may not be familiar with, which you can think of as interactive previews of the work you've done with Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Put all of that together and ignore every single bug and you have Manus AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I asked, for example, create a simple website densely packed with text about what happened with LLMs in March 2025, lit up only by the cursor, which is acting as a flaming torch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Notice the model would have to do a fairly comprehensive web search a la Deep Research to find out everything that happened with LLMs in March 2025, but then also do a Claude project to make an interactive website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it would have to come up with this little window. So like OpenAI's operator, you could see it taking actions in real time. In fact, you can stop it and guide it. And when it all works, it's pretty impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is that website and I had to do pretty much nothing to get it working like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is where Manus is great, tying together all of these disparate capabilities, albeit not being incredible at each of them, but tying them together into this one agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's get a few things out of the way to dispel some false notions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Manus uses dozens of tools and several models, but the key model behind it as of today, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation, according to the information, is Claude 3.7 Sonnet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that model is fairly expensive and incredibly rate limited, which has led to one estimate reported in the MIT Technology Review of a per task cost of about $2 for Manus AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we rush then and call this China's second DeepSeek moment, we've got to realize a couple of crucial disanalogies with DeepSeek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">DeepSeek made their own model. Manus AI is a compilation of other people's models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And second, for me, what made the DeepSeek moment was how cheap it was and how widespread the availability was, hence it rocketing up the app charts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">At $2 per task, if you just did, say, five tasks per day, you can just calculate what the cost would be over a month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, this is probably why even YouTubers like me, who got early access, hit maximum daily usage limits pretty quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Tell me what you think, but no, I don't see Manus AI as the second DeepSeek moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What about quality, though?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in my opinion, it does everything really quite well, but nothing at state of the art level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me give you a few examples and try to bring in comparisons with DeepSeek from OpenAI, Grok3 DeepSeek, and even Gemini's DeepSeek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, the names are confusing, but Manus AI is multimodal in the sense you can upload an image and get it to perform a task based on that image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, I said list the founders of each company featured in this image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So it would have to recognize the names of the companies and then, of course, perform a kind of deep research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried this with all four of the tools I just mentioned, and I'm going to give you the results in order of speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Fastest was deep research from Gemini Advanced, which told me that adding files is not available yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That was done in less than one second, which is quite impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Next was Grok3 DeepSeek, which took only two and a half minutes and analyzed 344 sources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It was fast, but skipped plenty of the companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The results were generally accurate, but as you can see here, it said unknown founders for a bunch of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas I found it relatively easy to find the founders for quite a few of these companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Manus AI and OpenAI's DeepResearch took roughly around the same amount of time, about 15 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But the performance of Manus AI was noticeably worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What I mean by that is if you scroll down, there were two companies where it gave up trying to find the founder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not the only one, of course, to report accuracy issues.</span></div><div

Manus AI was asked about the gaming console market and ignored Nintendo Switch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be far easier for me to just hyperventilate about all the things it can create and the research it can do if I don't check the accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me try to give you another example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And trust me, I want to be as fair as possible to Manus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">This time, I gave all four of those agent tools that I mentioned a kind of meta task to research about each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Create a table comparing deep research from OpenAI, Manus AI, deep research from Google, deep search from Grok3 with rows for at least 10 features, price, speed and 20 clickable sources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">On this one, arguably, Manus did as well as deep research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It took far, far longer, around 20 minutes, but I don't know if that's because of the rate limits that are going on at the moment because so many people are using it or if that's just an inbuilt limitation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what Manus came up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you can't see Grok3, that's because the UI of Manus is a lot more jank compared to the others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The output is solid, if not entirely reliable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me give you two examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">First, on the cost per query, it said it cannot be calculated for itself, Manus AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, while it's true that pricing is not public, as I showed you earlier in this video, there are some public estimates about the price, $2 per query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, you might say that one's debatable, but how about this one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Towards the end, it said, what about performance metrics for Manus?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">No published benchmark results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Its own website gives the Gaia benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">On the column right next to it, it quotes the Gaia benchmark for OpenAI's deep research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it can't be fully relied upon to quote its own benchmark results, then it does make you wonder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Did it fully deserve the absolute cacophony of hype that it got in recent days?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's be fair though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It did give me 20 clickable sources for me to conduct further investigation, which is what I asked for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Deep research from OpenAI only gave me 15 sources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And worse than that, it didn't give me a table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It gave me bullet points and that was pretty disappointing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It too didn't cite Gaia, although it did link to an article which mentioned Gaia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of slightly better for deep research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Grok3 did a commendable job, but you could tell it was drawing on less compute because the table at the end felt a bit rushed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Its own research had confirmed that deep research was available for 10 queries per month to the plus tier, but this wasn't covered in the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, its research had highlighted certain benchmark scores, but these weren't mentioned in the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini's deep research did a decent job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very quick, but the table was fairly scant on detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">This is definitely not to say that Google DeepMind aren't cooking though, and there are plenty of developments from that company that I want to cover very soon on the channel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, like Operator, Manus can do things like actually book things for you, but according to all reports and my own experience, I would really caution against necessarily trusting it that much to do so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Manus AI for me is very much then fitting into the pattern that I've seen for four trends that have emerged in 2025.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I did a video on this five days ago for my Patreon and the trends are that models are getting pricier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They are very patchy in performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They have epic moments, but can be internally deceptive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I will have much more to say about reward hacking on this channel very soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Here then for me is the lesson of this video, which is this kind of marketing actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Two million people have signed up to the waitlist and there is something there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">As you've seen in this video, Manus AI is a great compilation of different tools and models and often gets the job done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But because this "sophisticated press push" reported in an interview with Xiao Hong, the founder of Manus AI, was so successful, expect more of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Expect an endless list of new companies pushing these YouTube campaigns and tweet storms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Hype works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">There's just no other way around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But if Manus AI comes out at being, say, $200 a month, I personally would give it a miss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much for watching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have any interest in jailbreaking, what I wouldn't give a miss is the Gray Swan challenges recently announced on their website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.780</a></span> |

to get involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The prize pool is over $130,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">From my perspective, you're helping the models become more reliable by red teaming them in public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's kind of like a public service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dZ6ADCPyc&t=768"
