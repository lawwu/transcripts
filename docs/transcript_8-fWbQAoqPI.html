Let's talk about a product, Granola. Just by a raise of hands, how many people have either tried or used Granola today? What they realize is actually there's a whole other set of customer needs that have been unmet, which is, I don't want you to take all of my notes.</p><p>I just want you to help me take better notes, empower me around this specific task and user. And that's what they built the product around. Now, because the realization is that you can't stop here. You can't stop by just assembling your initial set of Lego bricks. You have to sequence over and over again.</p><p>You have to take those first three Lego bricks, leverage them into another unique set that you assemble. And you see Granola doing this. Now that they've enabled this, they've started to create project and team workspaces and start to enable a new set.</p></div></div></body></html>
