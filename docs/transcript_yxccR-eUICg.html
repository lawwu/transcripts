My rock, do not be silent to me, lest, if you are hesitant toward me, I will become like those who go down to the pit. Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you for help, when I lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary.</p><p>Do not drag me away with the wicked and with workers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbors while evil is in their hearts. Give to them according to their work and according to the evil of their actions. Give to them according to the deeds of their hands. Return their dealings upon them, because they do not regard the works of Yahweh, nor the deeds of his hands.</p><p>He will tear them down and not build them up. Blessed be Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my supplications. Yahweh is my strength and my shield, my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart exults, and with my song I shall thank him. Yahweh is their strength, and he is a strong defense of salvation to his anointed.</p><p>Save your people and bless your inheritance. Be the shepherd also, and carry them forever." - Matthew 5:1-3 - - - -</p></div></div></body></html>
