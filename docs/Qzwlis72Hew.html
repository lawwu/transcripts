Wayne Grudem has a really good section in his Systematic Theology on union with Christ, and I want to commend that reading to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then two books that I would recommend and highly encourage you to purchase and to have on your bookshelves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">These two books are well worth the price of admission.

The doctrine of the believer's union with Christ is one of the most encouraging truths in all the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there anyone here tonight who doesn't need encouragement?

This is one of the most encouraging truths in all the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And you want to use this doctrine as a weapon, a weapon against discouragement.

If you look at your handout there, John Murray writes this, he says, "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not simply a phase of the application of redemption.

What Grudem is saying there is that every aspect of the Christian life is related in some way to the doctrine of the believer's union with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And Martyn Lloyd-Jones, the great preacher, speaks of the encouraging, uplifting effect that this doctrine ought to have upon our souls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "Here, then, is the doctrine that is before us, the doctrine of our union with Christ.

target="_blank">00:43:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul can't even introduce his epistles in the opening salutations without a reference to the doctrine of the union with Christ, the believer's union with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2643" target="_blank">00:44:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you ever notice

because of the emphasis of the doctrine in Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.300</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:44:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">A third reason why this doctrine is important is because of its connection with the blessings of salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's as simple as Ephesians 1 verse 3 where Paul says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us," here he is again, "in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So apart from Christ, there is judgment and woe, but in Christ, there is every

to enumerate the specific blessings of salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll note here he takes pains to repeat the phrase, "in Christ" or "in Him" in order to pound into our minds and into our hearts the understanding that none of these blessings come to us apart from Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">All of

target="_blank">00:45:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">He talks about the blessing of election in verse 3, "even as He," that is the Father, "chose us," believers, "in Him," that is in Christ, "before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2782"

according to the purpose of His will, to the praise of His glorious grace with which He has blessed us," here it is, "in the Beloved," who is that? That is Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul talks about the blessing of redemption, being bought from slavery. He talks about the blessing of forgiveness of sins, our sins being removed from us as far as the east is from the west.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2819" target="_blank">00:46:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse 7, "in Him," there are that phrases again, "we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of His grace which He lavished upon us."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2831" target="_blank">00:47:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">"In all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of His will according to His purpose which He set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time to unite all things in Him, things in heaven and things on earth."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Paul talks about the blessing of an eternal inheritance in heaven. Verse 11, "in Him we have obtained inheritance having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of His glory."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there is the blessing of the Holy Spirit. Verse 13, "in Him you also when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in Him were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it to the praise of His glory."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The blessing of election, the blessing of adoption, the blessing of redemption, the blessing of forgiveness, the blessing of an inheritance eternal in the heavens, the blessing of the promised Holy Spirit, Paul says repeatedly over and over again, all of these blessings come to us in Christ by virtue of our union with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We have received every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ. So if you love any of these blessings, or if you love all of these blessings, then you must also love the doctrine of the believer's union with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What about the blessing of sanctification? What about the Christian life? What about Monday to Friday? How I live each and every day? What about marriage? What about how do I deal with my roommate? What about how I conduct myself at work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">How does the doctrine of union with Christ relate to those issues of sanctification? I'm glad you asked because Romans 6, verse 1 explains that the doctrine of the believer's union with Christ is the foundation for all of our pursuits in sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, if we are not united with Christ, then there is no hope that we are going to grow in our sanctification. It is only because we are united with Him that we can pursue greater Christlikeness and greater holiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul says in Romans 6, verse 1, "What should we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means. How can we who die to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, notice there, that's not water baptism. That's what we call a dry verse. There's no water there. The word "baptizo" literally means to immerse or to submerge. Paul is speaking here of our immersion into the person of Jesus Christ, which occurred at the moment of our conversion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">When you and I believed in Jesus Christ, we were literally immersed into His person, immersed into His power. The Bible talks about a baptism of fire, a baptism of suffering, a baptism into water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Here, Paul is talking about our immersion or our baptism into the person of Christ. We were literally immersed into Christ Jesus. That's union.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul says there, "Do you not know that all of us who have been literally immersed into Christ Jesus were immersed into His death?" We were so totally identified with the person of Christ that when He died, we died. As Paul said, "I have been crucified with Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse 4, "We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead, by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">For if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His. We know that our old self was crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we also will live with Him." Now, that's a passage I've used in counseling ministry just to tell believers that you are not a slave to sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You do not need to live in bondage to sin. Yes, there will be a battle, but you do not need to have a sin as a functional master over your life. On the basis of this text, I am telling you that you are not a slave to sin, and you're united with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm excited to see what God's going to do in your life as you meet with me and as we look at God's Word together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one of the ways you use the doctrine of union with Christ with a believer in counseling ministry, just reminding them that when Christ died, you died, and when He rose, you rose, and you are no longer a slave to sin because you are united with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">St. Clair Ferguson names eight ways the salvation is in Christ. I'd encourage you to get his work and just look at that in further detail. A summary of that shows up on Justin Taylor's blog at the Gospel Coalition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Eight ways the salvation is in Christ. He said we are initially united with Christ in regeneration, the glory of our new birth, of being made alive in Christ. It is at regeneration that we are united with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, we appropriate and continue to live out this union through faith. Paul says the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God. Number three, we are justified in union with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul says, I count everything as lost because of the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ, my Lord. Christ Jesus, my Lord, for His sake, I've suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ and may be found, here's the key phrase, in Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ. Paul doesn't want to be found in himself and have God judge him on the basis of his own accomplishments. He wants to be found in Christ and be clothed with the righteousness that comes from Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Number four, we are sanctified through our union with Christ. Jesus said, apart from me, you can do nothing. Number five, we persevere in the life of faith in union with Christ. We'll say more about that in just a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Number six, we are even said to die in Christ. Revelation 14 verse 13, blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Number seven, we shall be raised with Christ. Number eight, we shall be eternally glorified with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So note, all of the blessings that we receive, we receive in Christ, election, adoption, redemption, forgiveness, the gift of the Holy Spirit, our eternal inheritance in heaven, and then all of these different aspects of salvation are communicated to us that they occur by virtue of our union with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3336" target="_blank">00:55:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We are regenerated in Christ. We are justified in Christ. We are sanctified in Christ. We persevere in Christ. We die in Christ. We will be raised in Christ. We will be glorified with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">John Owen writes that union with Christ is the cause of all other graces that we are made partakers of. They are all communicated unto us by virtue of our union with Christ. Hence is our adoption, our justification, our sanctification, our fruitfulness, our perseverance, our resurrection, our glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And Millard Erickson says that in one sense, union with Christ is an inclusive term for the whole of salvation. The various other doctrines are simply subparts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you get the idea why I said to my wife last night, you know, we just don't make a big enough deal about this doctrine as we ought to in the church and in our Christian lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this ought to be, as Martin Lloyd-Jones said, I mean, this is the exhilarating doctrine that brings assurance and comfort and hope and joy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3412" target="_blank">00:56:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We ought to make a much bigger deal of the truth that we are united with Christ. And indeed, James Stewart has made this observation that union with Christ, rather than justification or election or eschatology or indeed any of the other great apostolic themes, is the real clue to an understanding of Paul's thought and experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3440" target="_blank">00:57:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to touch on some of this fairly briefly because I'm running out of time here. But let me just pause in a moment. So this is how it works in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe you can relate to this. Maybe this helps you. Maybe you'll say, Dan, that's just you and I can't relate to that at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3456" target="_blank">00:57:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is how it works in my life. When I pray and when I come into the presence of God the Father, and I remind myself of the fact that He is a holy God and I'm a sinful man, I immediately feel a sense of unworthiness to come into His presence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3474" target="_blank">00:57:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I immediately go to my many failures, my many sins, sins of omission, sins of commission, my lack of godliness, my wrong frame of mind and heart when I come in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3490" target="_blank">00:58:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know about you. Maybe some of you wake up every morning and you just feel instantly godly when you wake up in the morning. For me, it takes a couple cups of coffee just to feel half a Christian in the morning some days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know what I mean, it's just you're dry, you're struggling to pray, you feel very unworthy to come into God's presence. And that's when I use this doctrine that Father, you will accept my prayers and you will accept me not because of who I am, not because of what I've done, not because of the good frame of my heart, not because of the bad frame of my heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You will accept me because I am united with your Son. And because I am coming to you in Christ, through Christ, with Christ, because of Christ, on the basis of Christ, because you love your Son and I'm united with Him, you will accept my prayers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3544" target="_blank">00:59:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remind myself that not only do I have the right and the access to come into the presence of the Father, but because of Christ, because I'm coming in Christ, I have the right to come boldly, with confidence, with access, with freedom of speech, to lay all of my cares and all of my concerns and everything that is on my heart to come to my Father because He accepts me on the basis of His Son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remind myself that He is pleased with Christ. He will never reject His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, He cannot reject me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3585" target="_blank">00:59:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remind myself that it's the Spirit's ministry to testify to the believer's union with Christ so that I have this confident prayer language. I can cry out, "Abba, Father," and know that the Father will accept me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=3603" target="_blank">01:00:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how it works in my life. When I'm struggling to pray or I'm struggling to just act as a Christian, I use the doctrine of union with Christ.

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=4505" target="_blank">01:15:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">but in the disordered functional desires of how a person tends to see

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=4525" target="_blank">01:15:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">because he sees that that is his primary identity, and underneath all of that at the

so repentance and faith is moving that person back to the rightly ordered desires.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=4541"

take this as inspired truth, but you can think through this with me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=4561" target="_blank">01:16:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">but I do think that the doctrine of union with Christ has relevance to those types of issues,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzwlis72Hew&t=4567" target="_blank">01:16:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you want more teaching on that, you can look at the IBCD conference that is
