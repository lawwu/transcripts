I'm here with Patrick Cho. Patrick, can you introduce yourself? Yeah, I'm Patrick Cho. I serve as the pastor at Lighthouse Bible Church in San Diego. All right, and Patrick, you've been using the LSB. What do you enjoy about it? Yeah, I think a lot of guys, rightfully so, talk about the consistency of the translation of various words.</p><p>But the thing that really strikes me is actually a lot of the syntactical choices. One passage that I saw recently that a lot of pastors go to during communion is in 1 Corinthians 11 23, because it says there, "For I received that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread." And I just thought it was really interesting because of the tenses of the verbs.</p><p>You have "for I received" aorist tense, "that which I also delivered" aorist tense, "that Jesus took bread" aorist tense, but then "in the night in which he was being betrayed," and that's imperfect tense. I don't know of any other translation that renders that verse that way, and I was thinking about it like that might not be your major point in your sermon on that text.</p><p>You might not even draw attention to it, but I love the fact that even if you don't know anything about the Greek, you can, from the LSB translation, see that something different is happening with that verb. And I just love that syntactical choice of translating that verse and really serving as a reflection of the original.</p><p>Oh, that's awesome. Hey, thanks for stopping by, Patrick. We appreciate it.</p></div></div></body></html>
