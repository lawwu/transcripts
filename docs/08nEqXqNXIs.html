In this period, I was interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">business, especially technology business. I read a lot of books about Apple and Microsoft. All this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was very exciting to me. Michael Lewis is the new new thing, et cetera. So I eventually started my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">own small little tech company as a high school student. And I was reading accordingly a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">business advice books, which were kind of touching on organization and personal productivity. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">knew the space pretty well. The general sense of this beginning period, 1989 to 1999, the general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sense surrounding personal productivity in the writing of this era was basically, look, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">fine not thinking about this stuff. It's not necessary. But if you do, if you're interested,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there's some cool things you might get out of it.

Probably the most influential book of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">period I have on the screen here now is Stephen Covey's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">People, Powerful Lessons in Personal Change. This came out in 1989, sort of set a lot of the tone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for personal productivity in the 1990s.

All right, so let's think about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">description. Right away, what should strike you is all of these words like principles, integrity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">service, human dignity. This is not a book about, "Hey, let's get after it and crush it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It was actually very much focused on human flourishing and thriving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So this genre of book, they have systems in it. So Covey has systems. In particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">he says you should be organized about your time and you should be careful to make sure that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">important things in your life get time, even though there's a lot of less important but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">urgent things that could crowd it out. That's his main point. And if you look at his methodology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">he actually has you list out what he calls the roles in your life. So this goes way beyond just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a professional. I'm a manager at this tech company. I'm a father. I'm on the leadership</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">committee of my church, right? So you have these different roles in your life. And his whole system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is about making sure that important but perhaps non-urgent tasks in each of these roles gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">regular time. So it's this principle-centered, service-centered, human dignity. He wanted you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to build a full life. So he had systems in this book, but they were just enough, just good enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure that you could service what was important to your picture of a life well-lived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was systems servicing a good life. This kind of made sense coming out of the '80s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which was a very psychological age, a very sort of self-reflective sort of Freudian,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">neo-Freudian age. We think we were very looking interior to ourselves and trying to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what our meaning in life, the baby boomers really big on this during the capitalist exuberance of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the '80s. So it sort of carries that feel over. So it's technical, but not obsessive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">over its systems. It's basically saying you need to get your act together so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you can do stuff that's important, not because somehow the work itself, you want to get more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of it done. So that was a huge bestseller, 15 million copies sold. I think it still may stand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">as the bestselling book in the sort of business productivity space. If we count Atomic Habits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">as a productivity book, that's sort of catching up, but it's nowhere near close there. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Atomic Habits is maybe 5 or 6 million copies. This book, it sold for like a decade because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there wasn't a lot else going on. All right. So that's one style of sort of 1990s, sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">optimistic. This is not necessary, but if you care about this, your life can get better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other style I would call the Sage Advice Guide. So I'm putting a representative copy of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one of these books up on the screen. This is How to Become a CEO, The Rules for Rising to the Top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of Any Organization. It's a New York Times bestseller written by Jeffrey Fox that came out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in 1998. This is another classic style in the '90s. Fox in this book, which was adapted from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">talk he gave, an alumni talk, I believe at the University of Pennsylvania. It's provocative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">big think advice. The book had rules. Each rule had like a page. They're pithy. And then it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have like some no-nonsense, interesting, thought-provoking advice. So I wish I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">look at... I don't actually have a copy of this book. If I did, I would look inside of it. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">let's see here. Here we go. Here's some rules. Know everybody by their first name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">No goals, no glory.

So there's like this growing dread that work was becoming unsustainable, and the thread</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of hope we had using as our sort of gospel David Allen was like, well, if we just build complicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">enough systems in response, we can somehow survive this. My professional writing career begins during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this era. So my first book came out in 2005. My second book came out in 2006. So it was like in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the core of this transition. Here's what's interesting about my books though. I had read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">GTD. I got into this world of productivity prong a little later, probably after my first two books</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">came out, but I knew about this changing mindset and this changing world. But my two first books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which were written for students, I remember I was an undergraduate when I wrote my first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">one and a first year graduate student when I published my second one. So I mean, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">young. I felt even then that the GTD style thinking, though exhilarating, there was something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not stale about it, but dehumanizing. It didn't feel quite right to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So my first two books actually drew from the 90s style. My very first book, How to Win at College,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was the Sage Advice Guide. I actually was directly influenced by How to Become CEO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote it exactly the same way, provocative rules, but now aimed at students. Sage advice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">provocative rules like, "Oh, I want to learn more about this. Let me read 75 of these and out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this, I'll get some nudges that'll make my student life better." So I wrote that first book like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">90s style book. Don't do all your reading, make your bed every morning. I mean, I sold that book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to my agent because my agent had published Jeff Fox's How to Become CEO. And I wrote her and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"I want to do that book, but for students." And of course that worked because she liked that book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because she had purchased and published that book and that worked out well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">My second book, How to Become a Straight A Student, classic Covey. There's systems in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, here's how you should organize your notes.

You have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually try to reproduce the information out loud as opposed to just passively read it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The systems to help you do that, it's not even that exciting.

So I was sort of out of step early in my advice writing career. I was out of step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with what was going on in the cutting edge world of personal productivity writing.

So, we sort of got to know each other. We were being covered a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in the press.

He helped update it to a knowledge work era. Then, Jenny further updated it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">applied his approach. In particular, she was talking about our relationship to our phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, she had these narratives about reusing social media, etc., all the time. In a Berardi-style,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we had internalized these narratives of capital production.

It was sort of classic newer Marxist-type stuff. Quickly, however, her critique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was generalized by the receiving audience because it talked a lot about our need to be productive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">all the time in this sort of internalized way.

We've used them here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, for keeping track of our advertisers for the podcast. Notion allowed the system to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">built out where you can see the information, all different views. Show me the ads we're reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this week. Let me look at this advertiser. Show me all the ads we've done for this advertiser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's look at this advertiser. And this day when we did the reading, we'll put the pointers right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3170" target="_blank">00:52:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there to where in the episode the timestamp was, et cetera, these custom systems that just made this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3174" target="_blank">00:52:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">repeated task easier. Well, one of the things I wanted to tell you about Notion is that they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">been increasingly integrating AI directly into the app, and this has been a game changer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So the AI that they've integrated, it's directly in the tool. It's not a separate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3190" target="_blank">00:53:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">chat window you open up in a separate browser tab. It's right there in the Notion tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It allows you to do things, for example, like generate ideas for text. Can you make action</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">items from, I just put in a transcript here of a meeting. Can you automatically generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">action items? Also, and this is the part I like the best, it allows you to interrogate your data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're like, I'm looking for, can you help me find all natural language? Can you help me find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3218" target="_blank">00:53:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the ad copy from this advertiser from February?

So now let's get to our Q&A with special guest host, Scott Young.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So it's time to answer some questions. As I previewed, we have a special guest to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3279" target="_blank">00:54:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">me with the questions today. My longtime friend, Scott Young. Scott is an expert in a lot of areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I often think about him as sort of one of the leading voices in thinking about learning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">how you learn things, how you learn new skills, how you learn new subjects. I also, with Scott,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">always feel like the way he approaches life and talks about life really resonates with the deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">life we talk about here. I think Scott is very intentional about how he approaches things. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">his advice is infused with that deep life magic we love here. So anyways, I'm happy to have him here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so we can get a couple opinions on these questions. Scott, the reason why you're here this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">episode versus another is that you do have a new book that came out. I think it came out or is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">coming out tomorrow. So if you're listening to this on the day the podcast drops, it's coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">out on the 7th, I believe. The book is called Get Better at Anything, 12 Maxims for Mastery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3337" target="_blank">00:55:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Scott, I have my blurb here. I'm going to read my own blurb. I said, "The ability to efficiently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">learn hard things is like a superpower. In this phenomenally wise book, Scott H. Young reveals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly how to obtain it." So Scott, thanks for helping me out here at the Q&A. Do you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">give us before we get going, what's your sort of elevator pitch you've been testing out for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">book right now? Why is my audience interested here? Yeah, so the book is sort of a deep dive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">into how learning works, understanding what are the fundamental ingredients that you have to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3369" target="_blank">00:56:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right to make improvement. And so I break it down to three components, which we subdivide into these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">12 maxims. So there's C, learning from other people. Most of what we know comes from other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">people. And so the ability to learn and understand what the best practices are, what the right way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">perform skills are, solve problems are, really determines to a large extent how quickly we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">learn ourselves. Do, which is practice. Obviously, you need a lot of practice to get good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">something, but not just every kind of practice is equally good. And so I spent a lot of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about how, you know, sometimes we need to make tweaks to our practice so we actually make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">progress and don't just plateau. And then finally, feedback. We need to get corrective information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from the environment, from other people, in order to fine tune our performance. So there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting research on how feedback works, when it works, when it doesn't work. And I go into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of those details in the book. So if you've wanted a handbook that will sort of map out this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">really complicated domain of learning science, cognitive science, it will give you a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3426" target="_blank">00:57:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pointers for getting started in your own improvement efforts. I don't know if you remember this, Scott,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but in the early days of my Study Hacks blog, back when, you know, we first knew each other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I used to have a link on the side to the Cambridge Manual for Performance. It was like the academic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">book that Anders Ericsson wrote. I love Cambridge Manuals. The Cambridge Manual, it was this dense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3450" target="_blank">00:57:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">book. And my readers were like, "Well, you know, I know you're like Anders Ericsson, but my god,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3456" target="_blank">00:57:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't follow this." So we've come a long way because you make this information so much more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3462" target="_blank">00:57:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">accessible. Let me ask you, I mean, before we get to the readers' questions, question for you from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">me, so, you know, from my list, Cal asks, "What is it, like, a lot of my audience wants to master</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">things, right? I want to learn this skill so I have more leverage. I'm trying to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3477" target="_blank">00:57:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">change some aspect of my life, etc. What is it that people are most likely or often miss from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3483" target="_blank">00:58:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this framework when they just try to go after mastering things without mastering the process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3489" target="_blank">00:58:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of mastering things?" - Yeah, I mean, it's hard to point to one exact thing because I find with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, different skills there tends to be different tripping points. So, I mean, you and I have had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of conversations about writing and the writing industry, and it seems to me from, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">viewing people who, like, want to write books that this C component, this ability to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3507" target="_blank">00:58:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">learn what is the best practice, what are the ingredients you need to have to succeed as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3511" target="_blank">00:58:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">writer, are just missing. And so the problem is not that people aren't doing enough writing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3515" target="_blank">00:58:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">even though you have, like, things like, I know your favorite month is National Novel Write Month,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3519" target="_blank">00:58:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but you have things like this where people are, like, churning out all their writing because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3523" target="_blank">00:58:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">think the problem is that I'm not writing enough. And the problem is actually you don't understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">how this field works, you don't understand how to navigate what are, in some cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a fairly narrow corridor of success. But then there's other skills where, you know, the problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, is often it is very much leaning on this lack of practice or the right kind of practice. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3542" target="_blank">00:59:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I've spent some time learning languages, it's a bit of a hobby of mine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can say, you know, with definite certainty that the maximum, you know, the majority of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3550" target="_blank">00:59:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">who go through language classes, you know, Spanish class in high school, the problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3554" target="_blank">00:59:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason they don't speak Spanish after it is that they have not done enough speaking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3558" target="_blank">00:59:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">enough listening to achieve fluency.

If I just do this, just force myself in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one month, I will have this brilliant book that everyone will buy.

Now, to match the deep dive I did earlier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3642" target="_blank">01:00:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they're all roughly surrounding productivity and productivity-related issues. So Scott,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in my deep dive, I was talking about my history, like the evolution of the field of productivity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3653" target="_blank">01:00:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from when I first started working in it to where it is now. So they're kind of vaguely around there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3658" target="_blank">01:00:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think this will be a good chance to talk about mastery and just other things you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about. All right. Yeah. First question. This comes from Alex. Alex says, "My file organization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3669" target="_blank">01:01:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">system can be a hindrance to deep work blocks. In my job, I run a lot of tests. So I usually have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">separate folders for each test with a text file of the reason for the test and the conclusion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3682" target="_blank">01:01:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but I spend too much time searching through my project archives for similar cases to apply to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">new projects. An approach like the PARA method by Tiago Forte is okay, but I can't quite abstract it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to my case." All right. So this is an in-the-weeds questions. First of all, Scott, I know you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Tiago. Do you know the PARA method? Do you know what he might be referring to there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. So he talks about this in "Building a Second Brain." I won't give a spiel about what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the PARA method is. I think that's probably something best left for Tiago. But if anyone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3713" target="_blank">01:01:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">interested, Tiago, yeah, he wrote "Building a Second Brain," a very interesting book on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like emerging... It's old, but it's also new, this trend of like doing note-taking systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3724" target="_blank">01:02:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And the PARA method, I think he has a second kind of follow-on book just focused on that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about like how do you organize your knowledge and information. Now, I think it's interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because I spend a lot of time thinking about this from a writerly context of like writing books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because with this book in particular, I had a lot of research that I had to cover. And I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">when I was writing my first book, "Ultralearning," I was not too careful about how I organized the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">research. And I was like, "I'm going to print off all these academic papers." And I just had like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">binders of papers. And then when it came to like, "Where was that paper that said X?" Oh my God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it was a nightmare. It was just like trying to find these things and looking over documents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3760" target="_blank">01:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and this kind of stuff. And so I do think when you're dealing with big projects with lots of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3764" target="_blank">01:02:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">files, having a good file system is going to be very important. Now, it sounds like this is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a programming kind of question. I don't want to give like a programming specific answer. I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3773" target="_blank">01:02:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in this person's job dealing with lots of different tests. But I think the big thing that you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3779" target="_blank">01:02:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">think about when you're creating any kind of sort of external knowledge management system is you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have to think about like what is the context when you're going to want to retrieve it? What is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">context when you're going to want to be able to retrieve that? And you want to be, as you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">creating it, creating tags or little breadcrumbs that you can find that information later based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that information. So a big thing that I did when I was going through all of my research is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3806" target="_blank">01:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a big period of time where I was just reading research and I didn't have like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">"This is what the book is going to be yet." And then once I sort of started having ideas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I went through all the research and kind of categorized it as opposed to like, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this is about this topic or this topic in research." And I put these little tags on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that way, when I was looking for information on expertise, for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or transfer of learning or problem solving or this kind of stuff, it was much easier to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3834" target="_blank">01:03:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">those particular breadcrumbs. So I think part of the problem is if you just sort of organize things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3838" target="_blank">01:03:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you make this big complicated file system. If you're not thinking about what's the retrieval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">context, what is the situation where I'm going to be looking for it? What are going to give me the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3846" target="_blank">01:04:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">keywords that come to mind? What are going to be these systems that I'm going to want to pull up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3850" target="_blank">01:04:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You're right. It can be very difficult to find things later. So I think that's something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3854" target="_blank">01:04:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think there's a one sentence answer for everyone. But if you can think about where you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going to retrieve the information, it makes a big difference in designing the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, I'm a big fan of good enough low friction systems when it comes to personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3867" target="_blank">01:04:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">systems. Like it's good enough. I can largely find what I need for the most part pretty easily. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the friction of using it is very low. This is the problem I often have with more complicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">information management systems is the friction of just using the system, of entering everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3883" target="_blank">01:04:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">into the system begins to become an obstacle that you stop using it. It's like the old-fashioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Zettelkasten where you have to have all these numbers with the slashes and eventually you stop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">writing the numbers and the slashes. So let's reveal our actual technology for our book writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3900" target="_blank">01:05:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see if this is useful. So I use Scrivener. And when I'm working on a book, so I just have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3906" target="_blank">01:05:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a research folder in Scrivener and I create sub folders for different topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I put in links and articles and my own notes into those folders. I might have 30 different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3917" target="_blank">01:05:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">folders by the time I'm working on a book. I sometimes lose things, but for the most part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3921" target="_blank">01:05:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, okay, I can more or less find what I'm looking for. These 30 self-named folders is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">enough. It's a good enough system. And the friction is very low. If I can just grab an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">article and throw it in a folder and Scrivener, and I know it'll sit there until I need to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3934" target="_blank">01:05:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to it.

So I had two processes because most of the research was derived from either reading academic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3946" target="_blank">01:05:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">papers, which I downloaded and placed in one giant folder. So there's like 600 papers in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">one folder. And I also like sorted, I had like a queue of like to be read, read, and then like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ones that I decided I'm not going to read just because that also helped clear things up. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">don't want to like be mixing up things. Like what am I reading next versus what I've already read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then for books, every time I would finish a book, I would go through it very quickly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3971" target="_blank">01:06:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">copy any important highlights. So if it was a paper book, I would just make very brief notes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3977" target="_blank">01:06:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about like quotes and things that were important. Like if they mentioned some research or some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3981" target="_blank">01:06:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">finding that I thought was interesting, I would put it. And also I would do like my kind of high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3985" target="_blank">01:06:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">level retrieval. This is what the book was about. These were some of the issues that were brought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3988" target="_blank">01:06:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">up so that when I reflect back on the book, I have like one page that I can search through as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3992" target="_blank">01:06:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">opposed to the whole book. So I did that with books and yeah, with papers, any digital document,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=3997" target="_blank">01:06:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I would do highlights. And especially if there was something that was going to be a theme,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4002" target="_blank">01:06:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like something that, you know, I knew I was going to be wanting to talk about later. I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4005" target="_blank">01:06:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes occasionally using the, just the Mac preview thing, just put an annotation with like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">one word about that thing. So if this is a, you know, interesting study about transfer, I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4015" target="_blank">01:06:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">just write transfer or I could just write, you know, problem solving or one of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4019" target="_blank">01:06:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, as I said, the way it works for me is that I did a lot of this research, not quite knowing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">shape of the book. So there was a period where I was still figuring out what's the best way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">organize it, where I actually went through all of these notes and put them in a system called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the archive, which is closer to Zettelkasten system. But for me, it wasn't about like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">maintaining that system. It was just kind of like, okay, I've got like 500 papers here and I need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">compress them further because even looking through those highlights is going to take too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4047" target="_blank">01:07:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I need some kind of like, you know, all the research on this is just in one big thing. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4052" target="_blank">01:07:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have like 20 citations that I can just remind myself, oh yeah, this was the paper where someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">said this example or this kind of thing. - Wait, how does that, how does archive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4060" target="_blank">01:07:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">how does that work? - Yeah, so the archive is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">software that uses, like just uses like TXT files. So it basically allows you to make a bunch of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">very simple notes and then you can link to other notes in there. So I could say like, I made one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4076" target="_blank">01:07:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">where it's like expert novice differences, 'cause that's a whole area of research. And then I went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4081" target="_blank">01:08:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">through, when I was going through my papers, every time there was a paper like, okay, so-and-so and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so-and-so talk about expert novices, like so-and-so in this book talks about this. And I would give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these examples and ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. And then that way, when I was writing the chapter where I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about some of these, some of this literature and expertise, and it's sort of like, oh, I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, you know, these are some of the fields where this phenomenon has been found. I already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4101" target="_blank">01:08:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have the five things, 'cause they're written down there. But I think that process of converting it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4106" target="_blank">01:08:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to a, like a sort of Zettelkasten system, for me at least, was not something that was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4112" target="_blank">01:08:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just doing continuously throughout the whole project. I kind of, it's the same as you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4115" target="_blank">01:08:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like I started with a, like a relatively easy, simple system. And then once there was so much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4121" target="_blank">01:08:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it was like, okay, I'm going to refactor. You know, using a programming analogy, I know there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4125" target="_blank">01:08:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of programmers who follow you, Cal. You know, that's often what you're doing when you're writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4130" target="_blank">01:08:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">code, is that you like start working on a library and you work it, and then it gets messier and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">uglier. And then you're like, okay, let's refactor it. And you kind of rewrite the library, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">now you know what the shape of it's going to be. So I think of that way with research. I don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4142" target="_blank">01:09:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I would do that with every book, but with this one, which was a lot more like, what's the state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4148" target="_blank">01:09:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the science for different fields? And I don't even know how I'm going to use it exactly. It was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4152" target="_blank">01:09:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it was kind of necessary. So I spent like a couple of days just reorganizing notes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4155" target="_blank">01:09:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So here's a nerd question on that, though. So let's say in the archive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4159" target="_blank">01:09:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you create a page for expert systems or something like this. How are you then connecting that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4166" target="_blank">01:09:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">papers on expert systems? Is this like a back linking system or each of those papers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4171" target="_blank">01:09:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I just, yeah, I would just put the name. I would just put the name like a, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4175" target="_blank">01:09:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like the really brief citation, like, you know, this is like, you know, Simon, whatever, 2008,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or, you know, that kind of thing. And then because the way I saved, I saved all of the file names for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4185" target="_blank">01:09:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the papers with like first author name, and then, you know, title of the paper. Then you just, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4191" target="_blank">01:09:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">know, if you want to find the paper, because there's like 600 files in this folder, you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4195" target="_blank">01:09:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like sort by name, and then you scroll, scroll to find the name. Because usually, there were some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">examples where you actually like finding the correct paper by that person could be hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4205" target="_blank">01:10:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I, a lot of people seem to have the last name Anderson in this field. So I have like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4209" target="_blank">01:10:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to like put different Andersons, because there's like multiple ones. But,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4212" target="_blank">01:10:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but I mean, for the most part, you know, there's going to be like, I'm only going to have maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4217" target="_blank">01:10:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, less than a dozen papers by a single author. So if I say, you know, Simon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4221" target="_blank">01:10:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and then the date, it's usually fine finding it. But it wasn't so much for me, it wasn't so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about like, I need to make this like an extremely user friendly system. It was just, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the problem that I often have with writing, and I'm sure you do as well, is that you read an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4234" target="_blank">01:10:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">enormous amount. And if the if the idea is not really, it's not really referenceable by like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I know it's from this book, or I know it's, you know, so and so's biography, or so and so's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4246" target="_blank">01:10:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this, it can be hard to find things later. And so I think, you know, like, I also did that with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4253" target="_blank">01:10:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">some stories too, I wrote about Octavia Butler, and there wasn't a single source, I kind of went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4257" target="_blank">01:10:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">through like dozens of different interviews. And so when I was compiling things for her,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I made a special file where I was like, okay, it's from this book, it's from this book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4265" target="_blank">01:11:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because otherwise, you're just like, you're looking through like, a dozen books to be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4268" target="_blank">01:11:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">where did this thing come up? That was pretty good. That would work well for this paragraph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4273" target="_blank">01:11:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm writing right now. - Yeah, yeah. Well, that's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4276" target="_blank">01:11:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I would say, especially with scientific papers, when you're writing books, this type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4281" target="_blank">01:11:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">having something helps. I had so my slow productivity in science, a lot of science,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because my whole point with that book was I was taking a break from science papers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4290" target="_blank">01:11:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But for email, for example, I remember one of the things I did is I said, I'm going to read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4295" target="_blank">01:11:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">every paper Gloria Mark wrote. And I was like, okay, her research is like, I just need to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4299" target="_blank">01:11:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this research in and out. But then I had a folder of 25 Gloria Mark's papers, or it's just Mark's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">1986. So then I wrote a key.

What's the real worry here?

What do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4794" target="_blank">01:19:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually want to achieve?

That's number one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4798" target="_blank">01:19:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing I was thinking about too, is that it also sounds to me like maybe this person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4802" target="_blank">01:20:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">needs to like up the challenge level of what they're doing. I think that like the human brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4807" target="_blank">01:20:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is an effort saving machine. We are designed to be lazy and to avoid wasting calories and to avoid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4813" target="_blank">01:20:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">doing things that are like beyond what is the minimum required. That is how we are engineered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4818" target="_blank">01:20:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's nothing irrational about, you know, my classes are easy. I get A's all the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4822" target="_blank">01:20:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so I don't study until like one night before the exam because why would I, right? That makes sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4828" target="_blank">01:20:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in a kind of perverse way. And so I think, you know, for me, what was, you know, as someone who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4833" target="_blank">01:20:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">was a fairly good student without working too too hard in university, I think one of the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4838" target="_blank">01:20:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">made a big difference for me was deliberately seeking out challenges that were at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4843" target="_blank">01:20:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">threshold of my ability. Those goals which were, you know, I might be able to achieve this if I get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4849" target="_blank">01:20:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">my act together, but I won't if I just, you know, try to coast on it. And so things like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4854" target="_blank">01:20:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">starting a successful business, building a writing career, some of the personal projects that I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4858" target="_blank">01:20:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">done were of that kind of forcing function. And so if you are a high aptitude young person who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4863" target="_blank">01:21:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">seems adrift and is worried about your self-destructive habits taking over, that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4867" target="_blank">01:21:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I would be looking for.

I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4882" target="_blank">01:21:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that was exactly me as well. I, you know, my story in college, I studied how to study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4887" target="_blank">01:21:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and kind of cracked a system, right? And I was getting four Os, you know, every quarter and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4892" target="_blank">01:21:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't taking a huge amount of time. And so I began writing books. So like I need to do something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4897" target="_blank">01:21:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">else. I have to fill something else in here. I need something.

So A,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=4906" target="_blank">01:21:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to have something you're working towards that you want to work towards.

I've seen a lot of people talk about monk mode. Does this actually work? Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5021" target="_blank">01:23:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">monk mode, meaning you sort of, uh, I first heard this from Greg McEwen where he like I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5026" target="_blank">01:23:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">disappearing. I'm going to like a shed for a month and all I'm doing is writing, uh, Adam Grant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5033" target="_blank">01:23:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wrote about this in deep work. I called it the monastic mode of deep work. Um, or, or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5040" target="_blank">01:24:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I called the bimodal mode. I confused these up, but I was thinking about Adam Grant where he would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5044" target="_blank">01:24:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have periods of the year where he would just disappear to work on research, be out of touch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5048" target="_blank">01:24:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and other periods where he was back.

Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5054" target="_blank">01:24:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you might have the same take on this as I do, which is it's less about monk mode</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5061" target="_blank">01:24:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">working to me than it is the way the hyperactive hive mind constantly context switching that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5068" target="_blank">01:24:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">call normal work today.

And so I think the real challenge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5185" target="_blank">01:26:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have in doing, um, you know, work that, that requires cognitive demands is that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5191" target="_blank">01:26:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sitting and maybe you want to like read for three hours straight, but after like 15 minutes, your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5196" target="_blank">01:26:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">brain is telling you, you know what, maybe go on Twitter, maybe, maybe check that email inbox.

It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5224" target="_blank">01:27:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, I've got to stop now. I don't think that past a certain point, it's so much that your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5228" target="_blank">01:27:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">physical fitness is increasing.

And so I think when you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5236" target="_blank">01:27:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">into this or like, I need to do a lot of deep work mode, I think it is helpful to kind of create some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5241" target="_blank">01:27:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">constraints around your work so that you're prioritizing this deep work.

That does take a little bit of building up to get to. And so I think, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5254" target="_blank">01:27:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that's where this can be helpful is if like, if you're in the cabin in the woods, you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5258" target="_blank">01:27:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the friends, this kind of thing, maybe it's sometimes easier to transition to doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5263" target="_blank">01:27:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the transition to doing that is what's really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5266" target="_blank">01:27:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the practice message.

And for each of these, the tech to implement it is boring, right? Okay. So just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5891" target="_blank">01:38:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">based on my experience with these type of jobs, I've been dealing with people with these type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5895" target="_blank">01:38:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">jobs. The first of all, you need some sort of structured task management, right? So you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5899" target="_blank">01:38:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a place of keeping track on your different projects, what needs to be done, where you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5905" target="_blank">01:38:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">collect relevant information. So if someone sends you a file about that task, you're waiting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5910" target="_blank">01:38:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">work on or sends you an email about it, you can add it to where that thing lives. So all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5914" target="_blank">01:38:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">information lives in one place. Why I call this structured is because you can have, I use Trello</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5920" target="_blank">01:38:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for this, but you can use a Google doc for this. You want to have categories, right? So here's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5924" target="_blank">01:38:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks for a particular projects.

So you can keep track of, here's all the stuff that I know so far needs to get done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5943" target="_blank">01:39:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for the various things I'm working on.

The technology is boring, but you need something like that. You probably need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5970" target="_blank">01:39:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to do multi-scale planning at this level of complexity, Adam, right?

All right. So which of these things am I trying to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5983" target="_blank">01:39:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">progress on this week?

And then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=5996" target="_blank">01:39:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have a daily time block plan where you look at the weekly plan.

So if you have a bunch of things going on like this, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6011" target="_blank">01:40:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">real enemy, if we're going to get into Weed's deep productivity nerd stuff, the real enemy is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6015" target="_blank">01:40:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to be the context switches.

We'll do a five minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6038" target="_blank">01:40:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">real-time conversation, figure this out.

As people think up things that there's a question or something we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6051" target="_blank">01:40:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have to figure out, you add it to the docket. And when you get to the meeting, you go through that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6056" target="_blank">01:40:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">docket one by one. So you don't have to email people or Slack people when something comes up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6061" target="_blank">01:41:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that you worry about.

And, uh, it was, it was pretty recently. I, I had, um, my, my wife</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6888" target="_blank">01:54:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and my daughter were not, uh, not at home.

And I was just kind of like enlisting him and helping me and he just loved it. Now, part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6898" target="_blank">01:54:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it was me letting go of the idea that I have to get this done in the most efficient way possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6904" target="_blank">01:55:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because him helping me with the task probably slows it down a little bit. Like, I think we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6908" target="_blank">01:55:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you know, scrubbing the deck or something like that.

And so I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6916" target="_blank">01:55:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that idea of, you know, letting go a little bit of some of the processes is good.

Um, it's just, things are on a very different rhythm there. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6931" target="_blank">01:55:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I do think there's a, there's a real place for like trying to flip your mindset and not have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6938" target="_blank">01:55:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">quite so efficient minded approach, especially for certain types of things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=6942" target="_blank">01:55:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">- It's almost like a slower version of productivity.

So this podcast is coming out in early May. So I want to talk about the books</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7272" target="_blank">02:01:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I read in April, 2024. All right. The first book I read was an empire of their own by Neil Gabler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7282" target="_blank">02:01:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a history of the early tycoons of Hollywood.

And then I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7293" target="_blank">02:01:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">got back to it and finished it in April. So I put my books in the month where I actually finished</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7297" target="_blank">02:01:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">them. I mean, it's a very good book. It won a bunch of awards. It's Neil Gabler, who I really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7302" target="_blank">02:01:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like. The book Neil Gabler wrote that I liked best was his epic biography of Walt Disney,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7309" target="_blank">02:01:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is fantastic. So Neil Gabler is great. This book was late 80s, early 90s. It feels it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7313" target="_blank">02:01:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you read any of these sort of biography type books from that period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7318" target="_blank">02:01:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they're very psychoanalytical. The focus is really on the psychology of these tycoons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7323" target="_blank">02:02:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and which is interesting, right? They're all typically first or second generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7329" target="_blank">02:02:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">European immigrants.

And it really gets into the psychology. Everyone who is profiled as Jewish,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7341" target="_blank">02:02:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of talking about this sort of changing relationship with their religion versus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7347" target="_blank">02:02:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">their parents, who were coming out of sort of the shuttles of Eastern Europe and how they sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7352" target="_blank">02:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cast off that baggage, the next generation in the US. So a well-written book. It felt a little slow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7360" target="_blank">02:02:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for me, mainly because what I was looking for, I was looking for a technical history. I wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7365" target="_blank">02:02:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">know about the early film technologies and the content, how the studios took off, the marketplace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7372" target="_blank">02:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for this. And the book was about the people, not about the business. So for me, that was a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7377" target="_blank">02:02:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bit of a disappointment, but it's clearly a well-written book, especially if you're used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7380" target="_blank">02:03:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to that sort of 80s style of psychoanalytical biography. Then I read Co-Intelligence by Ethan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7388" target="_blank">02:03:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Mollick.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7413" target="_blank">02:03:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so he has 150,000 people that subscribe to this newsletter. I subscribe to it. I need to keep up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7418" target="_blank">02:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with this stuff for my own reporting, et cetera. So he had his first book come out, this portfolio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7422" target="_blank">02:03:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">book, My Same Publisher, where he's just, it's like, "Hey, let me just bring you up to speed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7426" target="_blank">02:03:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with what's happening in AI right now, how it works, how people are using it, what might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7431" target="_blank">02:03:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">coming." And so it's exactly what you would want from this book. "Hey, Ethan, you're up to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7437" target="_blank">02:03:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">eyeballs in AI.

It's not a long book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7469" target="_blank">02:04:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I read Dragons of Eden by Carl Sagan.

It's written in the '70s and it's a lot about neuroscience and evolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7485" target="_blank">02:04:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we know about the brain? A lot of this was new then. It'll sound more familiar to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7493" target="_blank">02:04:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">modern ear, but a lot of new stuff happening in neuroscience. It's a little bit esoteric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7498" target="_blank">02:04:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in that it kind of jumps from thing.

There's kind of a Jungian aspect to that. So it's a good book on neuroscience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7533" target="_blank">02:05:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a good writer.

Whereas this other guy who was training so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7727" target="_blank">02:08:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hard, he could run these fast miles day after day after day after day.

British amateurism, which is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7749" target="_blank">02:09:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">"This really is a hobby and I do on the side because it's good to be disciplined."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7753" target="_blank">02:09:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you had the Australian version of it, which is like, "My whole life is built around just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7757" target="_blank">02:09:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">training to do this one thing." And you had the American version of it, which is very collegiate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7761" target="_blank">02:09:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is, "No, I'm a member of a track team and we get a lot of support and we have expert coaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7766" target="_blank">02:09:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and our colleges pay for it and our expenses are paid for, but I have to run five events in each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7769" target="_blank">02:09:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">meet.

And then there's this one extra big race</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7782" target="_blank">02:09:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">afterwards where the Australian guy is like, "I'm going to destroy Bannister." Because the Australian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7787" target="_blank">02:09:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">guy then breaks Bannister's record and they get together for this final race and Bannister beats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nEqXqNXIs&t=7793" target="_blank">02:09:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">him.
