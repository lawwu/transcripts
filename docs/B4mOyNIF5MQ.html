So you should let the church, the pope, ultimately decide what everything means and let him instruct you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To which the person could consistently say, "But then how do I know when I'm reading what the pope wrote in his encyclical that I'm interpreting the pope correctly?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=141"

target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a kind of person that is like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

some biblical guidance for how to understand the law in the Bible and to help me know I'm interpreting it correctly?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The second person has a much deeper problem and is basically calling into question whether a human being can know anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are skeptics like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're wired to be so suspicious and so skeptical about their own interpretations that they never come to a knowledge of the truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me take these one at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the first one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some biblical pointers for how to handle the law?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm thinking Mosaic law first and then Old Testament more generally, say, to handle it correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's start with the context of the text they're asking about, 1 Timothy 1.8, where it says this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Certain persons, by swerving from a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith, have wandered away into vain discussion, desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they're saying or the things about which they make confident assertions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm skipping a few verses here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"To indict," verse 10, "to indict whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here are some pointers for how to handle the law in that context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One, don't swerve from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith because there are spiritual and moral preconditions for true handling of God's Word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, the prohibitions of the law are not mainly for people whose hearts are right with God and are led by the Spirit under the law of love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Three, the law is mainly for the lawless who need to be shown that there is an authority outside of them to which they will give an account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Four, a right use of the law accords with healthy doctrine, which Paul says in verse 11 is in accord with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So make the gospel of Christ crucified the touchstone for the right use of the law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's a second cluster of pointers from Romans 3, 19 and 20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul says, "We know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world be accountable to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For by works of the law, no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes the knowledge of sin."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we get pointers like, one, though the law is given to Israel, it stopped the mouth of the whole world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, it will never be the instrument of justification. No one gets right with God by law-keeping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Three, through law comes the knowledge of sin. That is, the law confronts us with our sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the solution to the sin problem. It points away from itself to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we read the law rightly, we will see that the law points away from the law to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a third cluster of pointers from Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, for example, in Matthew 5, that the law is misused by the Pharisees because they don't take it deep enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The law says, "Don't kill, don't commit adultery, but I say to you," and I'm getting at the real purpose of the law, "Don't get angry and don't lust."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are clues for how you handle the law in Matthew 5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or another example is when the Pharisees condemned Jesus and his disciples for eating with the tax collectors and sinners,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and when they condemned them for plucking some grain on the Sabbath and eating it as they walked along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in both of these cases, amazingly, in Matthew, Jesus said the problem was that the Pharisees don't know how to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mOyNIF5MQ&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't know how to read their Bibles.
