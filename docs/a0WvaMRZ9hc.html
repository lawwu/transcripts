Because we're -- I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">step through it first. So, you still have time. But we want to make sure you all have that doc. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

So, if we look at that -- those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions. The first thing is that we -- you do need a GitHub account. So, if for whatever reason you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have a GitHub account yet, this is a good time to get it. You should be able to get it for free. And if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you do have a GitHub account, just make sure you are logged into your GitHub account. And what we provided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">today for this workshop is two different things that are going to help you deploy these templates. So, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is an Azure Pass. So, this is really cool. Because normally things cost money. But we're giving you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">an Azure Pass, which will create a Azure subscription for you, which will give you up to $50 worth of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">credits. And it will expire in seven days. So, I guess you can keep working with it for the next seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">days. And it'll certainly give you enough to get started during this workshop. So, that's really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, none of you should have to worry about any of this costing you money. We don't want -- we don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that to happen. And then the other thing that we've got you is, normally, when you're using Azure Open AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to sign up to get permission to use it. You actually have to go fill in a form and get approved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for it and get your account opened up for it. So, since it takes time to fill up that form -- and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">reason we do this is for responsible AI reasons. We want to make sure people are using Azure Open AI for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">good reasons, which is good. I like that about Microsoft. But it does take time. So, we have set up this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Azure Open AI proxy that all of you will be able to use during this workshop. So, you're going to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Azure Pass so that you can freely deploy these things. And then, Azure Open AI proxy so that you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to worry about getting permission to use it. So, that's what a lot of this setup is. So, the first step is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to get that pass set up. So, I'll demonstrate from here. Let me go to my Firefox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, when you go to this Azure check-in link, it's going to ask you to log in with GitHub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, let me do it in my -- I've got three browsers open right now.

The Wi-Fi was -- Oh, sometimes you mean that maybe the Wi-Fi is bad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it misinterprets it. It could also just be that the URL was slightly wrong. I think that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">happens for ACCA links. Okay. All right. Cool. So, then that has a link to this check-in website. So, on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">check-in website, we see that it has two options. Either create a GitHub account, if you don't have -- if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have one, or just log in with GitHub. So, I'm going to click log in with GitHub. And here we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was already logged in in this browser. And then you'll see this Azure pass. So, this is just a promo code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're going to use for the next stage.

I don't recommend using your work account if you do have a work account, just because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">work accounts tend to have a lot of restrictions on them. And I just think things will not work out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I recommend some sort of personal account. Either create a brand new Microsoft Outlook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">account today or just use your Gmail. Whichever those you want to do. So, you do need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">be logged into some Microsoft account. So, it says, okay, I'm going to be logging in with my Gmail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I confirm. I enter the promo code here. And then I have to do this horrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't, like, what is, oh, okay. DBW, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And then in this case, I got an error. And that's because I did already redeem my pass for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">account. But you should get a success if you haven't redeemed your pass for the account yet. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that should give you, set you up with this new subscription in your Azure portal. So, you can see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">now on my pamela.fox@gmail.com, I've got actually two subscriptions. Because I'm actually a paying user of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Azure. So, this is my paid Azure subscription. You can see I'm spending $40 this month. And then here's my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sponsorship, which I, you know, won't be paying for. So, that's, and if you're doing a brand new account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you're only going to see this sponsorship here. So, that's the expected flow to being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">get set up with this Azure pass. You don't have to do it right now. You could wait until we, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">break into hands-on time. Because then it probably is easier for us to walk around in case there's any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">issues. And just to be careful, make sure that in the next step, wherever you're using the subscription</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ID, you use it for the Azure sponsorship one, and not the other one, or you're going to get billed on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">your, on your credit. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you're worried about that, just make a whole new account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I have in my, let's see, that's Firefox.

And then it takes me to my account, but there's nothing here that says anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">about Azure.

And I've got all these like videos and blog posts about how you should never use API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">keys. Because when you're actually using Azure OpenAI, you can do keyless authentication using this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">thing called managed identity. And we have a talk coming up next week about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But in order to use this proxy and, you know, take care of the permission issue, we are temporarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sinning and using keys. Okay. So that's, that's a proxy. So you just have to log in and then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">should get the info for the proxy. Okay. All right. So now I'm going to step through one of the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">templates. So, you know, all the templates are open source repos, but we've put together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions specific to this workshop in, in this, uh, read me here, these three read me's and really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">specific to using that proxy. So we're going to ramp up in terms of complexity. So we'll start off one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that's, uh, really simple. Like this is one where you, you know, it's, uh, just to show you how things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">working and, and get things going. And then we'll move on to two different rag applications, uh, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">are more sophisticated and ending with our most sophisticated one that has been deployed like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred thousand times at this point by Azure developers. So it's a very, very popular one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so let me start with, you know, this first one. So we go to the read me and the first step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is to open the project using GitHub code spaces. Uh, has anyone here used GitHub code spaces?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. A few people. Okay. So GitHub code spaces is very cool. Any GitHub repository you go to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you can open them up in a code space. So you can like start hacking on that repository immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and then we can also customize like the environment for that. So what it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">open is actually a VS code in the browser that has that project loaded in. So we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">do you know one, one very cool thing about GitHub code spaces is like, you know, when you share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">something with like someone and they say, well, it was working on my machine, but it's not working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">yours, right? That problem that we all have with all the setting, the local environments and all of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">code spaces, you, if you use code spaces, you don't have that problem because I will have the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">environment as Ash, as Pamela. So I will not have the problem. Like it's not working on my computer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's working yours, right? So it's one of the pain points that code spaces came to solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of us, we use code spaces on a daily basis because setting up your local environment in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">computer can be very, very painful. Um, so, so yes. Does everybody have access to their Azure subscription by now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody who's not? Okay. If you're not, you can just, okay. Can we just like try to solve that and then we go through?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Okay, cool. Azure? The proxy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's a proxy. Yes. So the question is, how do you get to the repo? So there is a link.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">This one? Yeah, this link over here. It takes you to the GitHub repo with all the, everything that you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's here. With the code and everything. No, I can't edit. Yeah, there's like a blank page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Skip the blank page and then go to the not blank page. It can blame on me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll help you. Control F hands on. So the other question was, how do you know if you have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">subscription? You go to portal.azure.com and then you find subscription. Yeah, and then you click on subscriptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I'm going to step through the instructions just for the quick start one and then we'll really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">set everyone loose and so that we can walk around. So this one is, yeah, just a simple chat application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to start off with running this local, well, I'm going to call it local. I'm inside GitHub</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">code spaces, which is VS code in the browser in this containerized environment, but I'm going to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a local server inside GitHub code spaces. So I like to start with local development first when I can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so I can like make sure that things are working. And then once I know it's working locally, then I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1787" target="_blank">00:29:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">deploy it to Azure. So we're going to start with a local server inside the code space. So looking at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions here, so I've got the project open. The first step is to make a .EMV. So we have a sample</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So I'm just going to copy and paste the stuff from the sample. And you know, the one negative about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">using code spaces with conference Wi-Fi is that it is a online environment. So if you want, you are also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">welcome to try these out, these projects locally. This is just how we can guarantee less issues with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">developer environment setup. Okay, so you can see in this environment file, we need to specify the endpoint</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and the key and the deployment. So for the endpoint, we're going to go to the proxy page and grab that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">endpoint URL and put that here. And so it looks like this HBS politeground blah, blah, blah, blah, slash API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">slash V1. That's what your endpoint should look like for all of these. So literally, the OpenAI SDK</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to send requests to this endpoint, and you know, get responses from it. The next step is the key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we go here. And we're going to copy and paste that key. There's my key. Love it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the deployment name. So this is the name of our deployment of our GPT model. So if any of you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">use OpenAI.com. Okay, so on OpenAI.com, you just use things by their model name, you just say, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to use GPT-40. I want to use GPT-35 Turbo. On Azure OpenAI, you actually make deployments of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">models where you say, okay, I want a new deployment of GPT-35 Turbo, and then you give that a name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've actually named the deployment the same as the model here to make it either more or less confusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is one big difference between OpenAI.com and Azure OpenAI is that the Azure OpenAI has this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">notion of deployments. But everyone's going to put in GPT-35 Turbo here. So there we go. Okay. So I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">got a .env. And the next step is to run the server. All right. So this is running the Python backend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We can open this up. And so this will, when I click on this URL inside the code space,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll actually open up a very different URL. So this is the, this port running on side the code space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1944" target="_blank">00:32:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's got this like really funky URL. So then I can say like, write a haiku about AI engineer world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">fair. Okay. I always do all my testing. I say to write a haiku because otherwise LLMs get really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, verbose and you're just sitting there waiting forever. So there we go. That is working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's getting back responses. So you, you know, send any message that you can, haiku about San Francisco.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there we go. There we go. I actually just watched a video yesterday about how the golden gate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bridge was built. It's fascinating. Okay. So there we go. Now it is actually running. So this is running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the app that's inside the source folder. So if you want to explore it, you can, this is a court</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">application. Um, is anyone actually heard of court? It's not well known. Okay. Who's heard of flask?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Core is just the asynchronous version of flask. Like literally probably flask will become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2002" target="_blank">00:33:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">court at some point or vice versa. So core is just flask, but async. Uh, and we always want to use an async</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">framework when we're building applications that you make, uh, calls to LLMs because we want better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">concurrency. So you'll see for all our samples, they're all either using court or fast API for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Python backends, because those are the ways that we can have async. So you'll see, uh, async. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2025" target="_blank">00:33:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't, you know, worked with async a lot in Python, you just see asyncs and awaits all over the place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, because that's how we build, uh, with async backends. Uh, but this is the actual code that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">happening here. We're streaming in the response from the open AI client and, uh, we're getting back the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">responses and we're streaming it back to the front end using something called JSON lines or new line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">delimited JSON. It's just a way of streaming one line at a time. So let me do a longer one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just so I can show you, uh, how the streaming works. Do do do. And streaming is also another general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">practice. If you're, if you're making a user facing application, that's making a call to an LLM,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you really want to stream that response in ideally because then it's going to appear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">faster to the user because the time to get the first token, as soon as you get that first token,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can start streaming in that first token. So we are actually streaming in a token at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So like write, uh, a long essay about San Francisco. Okay. So we should see this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">actually stream in here. Uh, once it, so it still takes some amount of time to get that first token,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but then once you get that first token in, there we go. That was so fast. I wonder if the proxy is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually making it be a bit different. Let me see if I can see it in the stream what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I should see it in the response. Fascinating. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">normally I can see the stream tokens in the response here. I can try it with another of ours though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2127" target="_blank">00:35:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. All right. So we'll have to trust that, but, um, but yeah, there you go. So this is just our,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">our getting started experience. So this is the local server, right? So we are running the local server,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but we are hitting up as your, uh, as our, uh, you know, so we are hitting up a cloud resource</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's because it's hard to have a local, uh, a local GPT-3-5. Now, if you want, you can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">use these models with like Olama. I don't know if any of you use Olama, but Olama is a really great way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to run small language models. And so I add support for Olama to all my samples when possible. So if you want,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">locally, you can actually run against these small local models, like five, three or Llama two or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever, uh, it's just not going to be the same thing because they're different models, but that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">an option for local development. All right. So that's all set up. The next step is to actually deploy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this to Azure. So that's when we are, you know, going to be using that Azure account that you set up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing we have to do is log in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to do AZD off login. And we're going to use the device code flow when we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">inside a code space. So that's going to have us copy and paste some, uh, some code here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I press enter and it opens up this new tab and I'm actually going to open this up in, uh, another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">browser. We'll just pick a random one. Okay, here we go. And then I'm going to grab the device code here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I put it into here, sign in. Okay. So I guess I'm using my Gmail here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So I am signed in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So now I've logged in. So you want to make sure you log in with the account that you just set up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for that Azure pass. Then we're going to create a new, uh, AZD environment. So this is kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a new deployment environment. So a lot of times when I'm developing these, these samples, I've got like 20</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">different deployment environments where I'm trying out different configurations and stuff. So I'll make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a new one here for this one in the chat. Quick start. So you just give it, give it a little name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the next step is that we need to set some environment, some AZD environment variables. These</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are like our deployment variables. That's going to tell the, um, the infrastructure how to provision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. So we're going to tell it to not make Azure open AI because we're using the proxy. We're going to tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2273" target="_blank">00:37:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it the name of our deployment. So I can just go ahead and copy and paste those two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll just paste them here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And then I need to tell it the key. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2284" target="_blank">00:38:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the same key that we did earlier, but now this is going to be used by the actual deployment flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2291" target="_blank">00:38:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I go and find, oh, I deleted way too much. Come back. Okay. So just delete that part and grab the key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2303" target="_blank">00:38:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So now I've set the key for deployment and then I'm going to set the endpoint for deployment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And here we go. Where's that proxy at? There we go. All right. Okay. So now I've set all these AZD</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">environment variables. These are going to be used when we are configuring the infrastructure. And so then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we run AZD up. So what this is actually doing is that we're using this, um, infrastructure as code. Does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">anybody here use terraform or bicep or arm? Okay. Yeah. So terraform is probably the more well-known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one. So at Azure, we have our own version. Um, originally it was arm and it was JSON. Now we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have bicep, which is like a better version of arm stronger. Uh, but these are all our bicep files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also write terraform if you want to do that. I just, I know bicep more than terraform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are using bicep, which is infrastructure's code and that bicep describes how everything is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be made. So how are we going to make the open AI? How are we going to make analytics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">container apps, uh, roles, all that stuff. All right. So I need to select an, a subscription to use. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2375" target="_blank">00:39:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to use the sponsorship subscription. Um, for many of you, you might just have one subscription and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">then a location. This is going to be where like our container app is going to go. So I'll just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">pick a random location there. Okay. And now it is packaging everything up. Uh, so it is, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually building Docker image. So this one gets deployed to Azure container apps. That's like an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Azure option for running containerized applications. We also have like Azure app service,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Azure functions, Azure Kubernetes. Uh, but for this one and the second one, we're using container apps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">as a, you know, a nice place if you're using Docker. How many of you like Docker? I shouldn't say like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how many of you use Docker? Okay. It's a similar, okay. You know, I don't want to presume. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2423" target="_blank">00:40:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so if you do like Docker, you know, Dockerized, um, environments, you know, this is using a Dockerfile. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see the Dockerfile here. Uh, you know, installing requirements, running the server, all that sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff here. Uh, so then it's provisioning the resources. So it's going to do that whole step. And then I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">already got one, uh, you know, pre, uh, already deployed here. So we, it, once it's deployed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll have a container apps URL. And this is a URL that you can, you know, tweet, share publicly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. Try not to use up all, I mean, I guess use up all your credits, whatever. Uh, hi, LLM,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2460" target="_blank">00:41:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what's up? I don't know. I never know what to say. Um, I don't have feelings. Thanks. Uh, so now it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2468" target="_blank">00:41:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">deployed there. And then if I can, I can look at my portal and see, you know, actually see what it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">made. So I can go here and look at maybe container apps and, uh, that's actually a different one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me look for, let me go. I know. I think I just have to remember which thing I, I wish I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">got three different portals going right now. Here we go. Uh, so we'll do, uh, a quick start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe this one, there we go. So once it's all deployed, you can go into your portal and actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2508" target="_blank">00:41:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">find the resource group that was made and then you can see what was made underneath it. So here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a container app, you need a registry. These are everything we need in order to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a containerized app. So that's the flow for that one. The flow is similar for the other ones, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">other ones are a lot more, uh, a lot more sophisticated. I'm saying like they're ones that people are actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">using, uh, in production. So I'll just talk about RAG. Um, RAG is stands for retrieval augmented generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is our solution for the fact that LLMs like to make stuff up. I mean, that's kind of their,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2545" target="_blank">00:42:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of their, the way they work. They're just word prediction machines. And so if you get them to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">predict something that they don't know, then they'll, they'll go ahead and predict something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do we get LLMs to give us reliable output for a particular domain? We can use retrieval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">augmented generation. And so how this works is that we get in a user question. We use that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">search some sort of database, whether it's a, you know, a search engine, a vector database,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever you want. We search it, we get back results, and then we send both the original user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2574" target="_blank">00:42:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">question and the search results to the LM and say, Hey, now please answer the user question based off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the search results. And then you'll get a really good answer. So as long as you have a very good search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">search engine. So you really want to pick really good retrieval mechanism search engine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at that step. Because if you get good results, then you'll get a great answer from the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because LLMs are incredibly good at synthesizing information, summarizing based on what they see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So they just need to have this, you know, really good search step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have two different RAG options that you can try deploying today and over the next seven days. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2608" target="_blank">00:43:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">first one is RAG on Postgres. And so this is, if you like already had a database, imagine you've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like a retail website, you've got a bunch of products that you're selling, and you wanted your customers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to ask questions about those products, right? So you can, you can just search off those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">table rows for, you know, what the user is asking about, get back the matching table rows, and then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2633" target="_blank">00:43:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pass those table rows to the LLM and say, hey, answer this user question about the table rows. I'll show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you what that actually looks like when deployed here. So here I've got, you know, a product table for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">outdoor, outdoor shoe company. And so the user puts in, puts in a question here, and we get back all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">results, and where they say, you know, this is just info from the rows. And we can look at the thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">process here. And so we can see that actually, actually, it's even, I did the fancy one. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll use the simple flow first, so I can show the simple flow. And, and then we'll move on to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">advanced, advanced RAG. Okay, all right, so here, now if we look at the thought process here, we get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">search query, we use that to query the database. So these are the rows we get back from the database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2688" target="_blank">00:44:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And we do both a vector search and a text search. Now, I'm sure you've heard lots of things about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">vector databases. They're great, but you need vector search and text search, and you need to combine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">those results together. If you use vector search alone, you will not get good results. I've done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, hundreds of evaluations of this sort of thing. You need to have a hybrid search, which is going to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">both a vector search and a text search. So for Postgres, we can use PG vector for vector search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we can use their built-in full text search for text search, and then we can combine them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">together. So we get back results, and then we, you know, send to the model. We say, "Hey, your job is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">answer questions based off of sources. Here's the user question, and here's the sources." So at its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2730" target="_blank">00:45:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">simplest, this is what RAG is. This is the actual call that we make to the model, is please answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">according to these sources. Here's the question. Here's the sources. We get back the response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we can get a little fancier with that, so we go to the advanced flow here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and I say it's fancy, but I think it's actually what most people are doing at this point for their RAG</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at the least. So in this flow here, the first thing we do is we take the user's question and we rewrite it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">into a better query, because user questions aren't really optimized for searching databases or searching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">search engines. So we first ask an LLM, like, "Hey, here's a user query. Make this into a better query."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is what we can call the query cleanup phase or the query rewriting phase, and it's a really useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">first stage to have in a RAG application. And so then we get back, you know, search results, and then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">well, we get back the query, right? So in this case, it actually ended up giving the same query in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2792" target="_blank">00:46:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">example, and then we get back the results, and then we send it. But this gets particularly helpful when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have multi-turn conversations. Like, if I type in, let's see if it's going to perform for me today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">more options, right? More options on its own is a terrible query to send to a search engine, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is more options? More options about what? So I'm hoping that my query rewriting phase is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">clean this up. Now, yeah, see, I should test this before I do it. All right, so I can demonstrate that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">more in our other example, because I have done that demo more. This one's -- repo's a little fresher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I made it like a month ago. Okay. So that's what we're going to need for it. Now, another thing we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">do in the query rewriting phase, though, is that we can actually use OpenAI function calling in order to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the model to generate SQL filters for us. So that's what we've done here is that the user asked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I want climbing gear cheaper than $30. Well, we can make that into a SQL filter. So we actually asked the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM. We use OpenAI function calling and say, hey, can you tell us if there -- if we should do a price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">filter here? And so it comes back and says, yeah, you should do a price. It should be less than and 30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can use that to construct a SQL filter. So that's another really cool thing about having that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">first query rewriting phase is that then you can start doing more sophisticated things and having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it actually come up with more structured queries and not just do just like a full-text, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">full-text search. Okay. So that's RAG on Postgres. And so there we saw the flow of that. The other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2892" target="_blank">00:48:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">one that we have -- and this is the one that's super popular that's been deployed thousands of times -- and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what many people think of when they think of RAG -- is being able to do RAG on unstructured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">documents. So you've got PDFs and docs and Excels and HTML or whatever, right? You've got all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2906" target="_blank">00:48:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">documents and you want to be able to ask questions about it. And people are really excited about being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">able to finally ask questions about PDFs because then we don't have to open PDFs because nobody wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to open a PDF, right? So we can do -- we can do RAG on documents. And so that's what this demo does here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so let me go ahead and show the deployed version of that one, right? So I asked, what does a product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">manager do? I get back citations. I click on iCitation. That will load in the particular page number that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it got it from, right? So this is the PDF and the page number where we got it from. And this is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a question that's specific to this particular employee handbook. And we could do this RAG with anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here you can see the, you know, all the citations it found. And for the thought process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">here, it's similar, right? We have a query rewriting phase, we have the search results phase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we've got the prompt to generate the answer. So a lot of this is really similar. The big difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is that here we have to have a data ingestion phase because we need to figure out a way to take these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you know, 50 page long PDFs or something, and store them in, you know, in a searchable way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a data ingestion that will take a PDF, we crack it using Azure Document Intelligence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2981" target="_blank">00:49:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which is very good extracting text from documents. Then we chunk it, we do a token-based chunking. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we try to come up with chunks that are about 500 tokens large. And then we vectorize those chunks with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the OpenAI embedding models, and then we store them into Azure AI Search. So that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">data ingestion phase. So you're going to need, that's why this is the most complicated architecture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is because of that data ingestion phase there, right? So data ingestion, we're using Document Intelligence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Azure Storage to store them, Azure OpenAI to embed, and then Azure AI Search to store that there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But then it's really cool, and you can do it with all sorts of things. So I've got one that has my blog</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in it so I can ask questions about myself. Let me get that one open. Let's see my blog. Here we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And there we go. Good sleep strategies. I was just telling them how bad I am at sleep, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I have researched it a lot because I'm so bad at it. These are all from my blogs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And that's from, this is from parsing in like an HTML site.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3055" target="_blank">00:50:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So there you go. So those are, those are our, there's my blog. Those are, those are the RAG ones. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with RAG with the Azure AI Search, that's one where you could immediately get start, like get started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with putting your own documents into it and seeing what it's like to be able to chat off them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">What?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah. Good question. Can you put them somewhere?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. We'll put in the same doc, the same word doc. We can put the slides over there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And I'm, I'm done. Okay. Cool. I know like, let's go for the questions. And then I know that some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3098" target="_blank">00:51:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people were a little bit behind. I want to make sure that you have something running. Of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">everything that Pamela showed you, you're going to be able to do in your own time. Like we ran this over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and over and over and over again. We tried different things. We customized the HTML of the chat. We also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">changed the, the, the, the, the message. Like for example, one of the things that you can do is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of like you are AI assistants, I can say, you only know about Nintendo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Any other thing, just say, whoa, right? So you can do things like that. So there is a lot of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">customization that you can do on this, on this applications, uh, as she was showing you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3145" target="_blank">00:52:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use your own data. She was showing with the data from her blog, right? Uh, but I want to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sure that everybody's more or less on the same page, or if you have any questions like, whoa, Pamela,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what did you just do? I have no idea what is rag or any questions so we can help you get up to speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah, great question. So what, um, formats can it handle? Uh, so now as your document intelligence can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">handle quite a few, uh, so we have the, let me find the document about it, um, data ingestion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Uh, so these are all the ones supported by DI, right? PDF, HTML, docx, pbdx, xls, images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3199" target="_blank">00:53:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are all supported from document intelligence. And then we built our own parsers for text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is what, images? Right. So if you put, yeah, it's a good question, you see images. So if you send</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">images to document intelligence, it'll OCR them basically. It'll extract the text. Now, the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">thing is that you might want to do, um, like a GPT vision, uh, which is, which is a whole different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3222" target="_blank">00:53:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, which is where you're actually asking, sending an image to GPT like 4.0 and asking a question about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3228" target="_blank">00:53:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this repo does actually optionally support that. So if that's something you're interested in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you can try that out. That's, that's actually different from ingesting an image, um, slightly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">different process. But that's, that's also an option. So it just depends what are your images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and what are you hoping to get out of them. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What about, like, PDFs with images inside that have text that's, like, context to what's going on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So document intelligence will extract as much as it possibly can. To me, that's sometimes too much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but I did have an, uh, an incident where, uh, I did another one based off the Python playwright</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">documentation and the Python playwright docs has some images of the node playwright. And so it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">extracted the JavaScript out of those images. And then that messed up my whole rag, uh, because it did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3279" target="_blank">00:54:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">extract it. So document intelligence will generally try to extract as much as it can. And so if there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">text in the images, it'll just bring those out as text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. So you could do, you can add additional fields, um, where you just mark them as searchable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3303" target="_blank">00:55:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they would get searched as part of the full text search. Uh, so I think we even start off with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three different searchable fields, but you can, yeah, you can add fields, you mark them as searchable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">then they'll get searched as part of the full text search. In terms of the vector, only what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">vectorize will be searched. So if you do really want something to be searched in the vector search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3321" target="_blank">00:55:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then you'd want to do like what's called a content stuffing or content expansion, which is where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">take everything and you stuff it into the same field and then you vectorize it. Um, which is totally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">something you can try if you think it's going to be useful for vector. But I, I like, I have to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">really warn about vectors is that you, you just want to be careful with your vectors because sometimes we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3341" target="_blank">00:55:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like put too much faith in, in vectors. Like I'll show you like the blog post I did, uh, last week where I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">ran, um, I ran, um, I ran the, the, the stats. Um, so vector search is not enough, right? But look at the stats, uh, down here. Um, the other thing you should do is evaluate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So if I did, this is a text only search, it got a groundedness rating of 4.87, which is fairly high. And, um, I only was able to get 0.02 improvement by moving to text plus vector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll hear a lot about vector, but, but please remember to use hybrid and to use good hybrid. So if you just, if you just blindly like, you know, you just combine vector and text and kind of just use a basic algorithm, which is the reciprocal rank fusion algorithm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3387" target="_blank">00:56:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">then you'll actually get pretty poor results. Cause those vector results. Cause you have to remember with, uh, when you do vectors and you do a search cross vectors, you will always get results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause it's going to give you the most similar, even if it's really far apart. Right? So that's the danger of vector search is that you're always going to get results. And those results might be noisy. They might be distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you distract an LLM, it is very, very distractible. So, um, yeah, so, so the best, like with Azure AI search, this is the AI search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3417" target="_blank">00:56:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The best results is if you do hybrid with their semantic ranker model. And that's an additional machine learning model that actually reranks results according to the original user query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3426" target="_blank">00:57:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's the only way in my experience that I can use vectors and actually get, you know, get back to the results of a, uh, you know, better than a full tech search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3435" target="_blank">00:57:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to, just to plead, uh, evaluate and be careful with your vectors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3440" target="_blank">00:57:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Any, any other question or do you want us to repeat like one of the apps we can go over slowly, making sure that you are getting every little step?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause some people were having issues with the key and not able to run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it's good, but we can also walk, like walk around, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3463" target="_blank">00:57:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Uh, like, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question then for you. Uh, were any, like, were you able to get at least one thing running?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3472" target="_blank">00:57:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Anybody didn't get anything running? Like have no idea what we are doing? Okay. So we are going to help you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you, you didn't get anything running? Okay. And before that, I know that some people will probably walk around, um, but I really, really want something from you all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, one of the things that I want you all and you can save for later because this is very important for us is like, we love feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we give workshops and talks all the time and we want to improve, right? But don't say like, oh, I wish the wifi was better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure. Yeah. But this is out of control, right? So if you can take a picture, I would really appreciate any feedback that you have for us to improve or to make this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3528" target="_blank">00:58:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like very dense, this workshop, like there is a lot, uh, we try to compress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3533" target="_blank">00:58:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have like a lot of like materials that you can go and work by yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yes. So I have one of the questions for people who are like either working at a startup or like want to build a startup or are currently a founder of a startup would love to know what are some of the use cases that you're working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And does it like closely relate to any of the AI templates that we showed today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3561" target="_blank">00:59:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If not, like tell us more because this is not the only templates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3564" target="_blank">00:59:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just like three of the examples that we showed in the, for the workshop, there's tons of more AI templates available on the GitHub repository.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But for now, like would love to learn more about like, you know, some of the use cases that you're working on or you're interested in building and maybe like, you know, we can, we can answer some specific questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, is somebody interested in sharing a use case that they have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, like really appreciate if you have any questions. Yeah. Any like examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3599" target="_blank">00:59:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so one thing that it's, it's a good practice now that I'm seeing is when you open code spaces, you are paying for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So make sure that you either pause it or you delete it. Otherwise your GitHub account, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3619" target="_blank">01:00:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you have 60 hours for free, but right every month, I guess, but make sure that, uh, if you go to github.com slash code spaces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3628" target="_blank">01:00:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see everything that is running because I saw someone had like three or four or five.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so pay attention to that. Uh, so you don't, I don't, you can, you can expect, you can set, you can, can I, can I do a hip?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3647" target="_blank">01:00:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You can set up like, you can say in my case, if, if it's like, I'm not using for more than 30 hours, I just shut down automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3656" target="_blank">01:00:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, but it's something that sometimes you forget. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So make sure that let's see how many Pamela has. Pamela has a bunch of them running as you can see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So yeah, quite a few people are actually using this in production, which, um, at first we were a little surprised by because originally it was a sample, but now we've really hardened it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so people are using it for public facing stuff like, um, government websites using it because governments have lots of PDFs and documents and it's hard to sort through their stuff. Right. So making it easier for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">citizens to interact with government data is one use case. The other big one is internal HR stuff or internal meeting transcripts. Um, like being able to look through all the transcripts and ask like, you know, what did the CEO say then? Um, uh, internal sales training manuals. Like there's, there's like, there's so many people using it for lots of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3713" target="_blank">01:01:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So in terms of being able to automatically update the index, like you just had it in manual ingestion. Um, but you could use instead integrated vectorization, which is an AI search, uh, option where you set up an indexer. So you would point it at like a blob storage, your, uh, blob storage and say, Hey, every time this updates, every five minutes, make sure you refresh the index. And then it would, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">refresh it. Uh, so that would be one option or you could use like an Azure function with a trigger. And that's, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's another, uh, there's another repo that does that. Uh, it's the chat with your data solution accelerator repo. And this one sets up an Azure function that has a trigger. So, um, you've got a few different options for how you could keep it updated. Uh, people just figure out what's, you know, what works out for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3749" target="_blank">01:02:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Thank you so much. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WvaMRZ9hc&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.
