href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think people understand you take text and you have a predict the next word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and you take a diffusion model and you basically like add noise to an image and then kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">remove the noise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think for music, it's hard for people to have a mental model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what's the, how do you turn a music model on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what does a music model do to generate a song?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe we can start there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I'll even take one more step back and say it's not even entirely worked out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the same way it is in text and so it's an evolving field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you take a giant step back, I think audio has been lagging images and text for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think very roughly you can think audio is like one to two years behind images and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But you kind of have to think today like text was in 2022 or something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, the transformer was invented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like it works, but it's far, far less established.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, I'll give you the way we think about the world now, but just with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">big caveat that I'm probably wrong if we look back in a couple of years from now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the biggest thing is you see both transformer based and diffusion based models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">for audio in ways that is not true in text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I know people will do some diffusion for text, but I think nobody's like really doing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we prefer transformers for a variety of reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can think it's very similar to text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You have some abstract notion of a token and you train a model to predict the probability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">over all of the next tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a language model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You can think in anything

so much in between these two things, that it's just totally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">untapped how people want to experience the joys of making music because those two experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

I think from the model side, it's still really early innings, and there's still so much low-hanging fruit for us to pick to make these models much, much better, much, much more controllable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Much better music, much better audio fidelity. So much that we know about, and so much that, again, we can kind of borrow from the open-source Transformers community that should make these just better across the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">From the product side, we're super focused on the experiences that we can bring to people, and so it's so much more than just text to music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll say this nicely, I'm a machine learning person, but machine learning people are stupid sometimes, and we can only think about models that take X and make it into Y.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2643" target="_blank">00:44:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just not how the average human being thinks about interacting with music, and so I think what we're most excited about is all of the new ways that we can get people much more actively participating in music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is making music, not only with text, maybe with other ways of doing stuff. That is making music together, if you want to be reductive and think about this as a video game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">This is multiplayer mode, and it is the most fun that you can have with music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Honestly, I think there's a lot of – it's timely right now. I don't know if you guys have seen, UMG and TikTok are butting heads a little bit, and UMG has pulled –</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the music died.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the way we think about this is, you know, I think maybe they're both right, maybe neither is right. Without taking sides, this is kind of figuring out how to divvy up the current pie in the most fair way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think what we are super focused on is making that pie much bigger and increasing how much people are actually interested in music and participating in music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, as a very broad heuristic, the gaming industry is 50 times bigger than the music industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's because gaming is super active. And music, too much music is just passive consumption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have a lot of experiments that we are excited to run for the different ways people might want to interact with music that is beyond just, you know, streaming it while I work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think a minimum, you guys should have a Twitch stream that is just like a 24-hour radio session that – have you ever come across Twitch Plays Pokemon?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2738" target="_blank">00:45:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Where it's kind of like the Twitch – basically like everyone in the chat, in the Twitch chat, can vote on like the next action that the game state makes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they kind of wired that out to a Nintendo emulator and played Pokemon like the whole game through the collaborative thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds like it should be pretty easy for you guys to do that, except for the chaos that might result. But like, I mean, that's part of the fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I agree 100%. Sorry. Yeah, like one of my like key projects or pet projects is like, what does it mean to have a collaborative concert?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe where there is no artist and it's just the audience, or maybe there is an artist, but there's a lot of input from the audience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, if you were going to do that, you would either need an audience full of musicians, or you would need an artist who can really interpret the verbal cues that an audience is giving, or nonverbal cues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can give everybody the means to better articulate the sounds that are in their heads toward the rest of the audience, like, which is what generative AI basically lets you do, you open up way more interesting ways of having these experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think, yeah, like the collaborative concert is like one of the things I'm most excited about. I don't think it's coming tomorrow, but we have a lot of ideas on what that can look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I feel like it's one stage before the collaborative concert is turning Suno into a continuous experience rather than like a start and stop motion. I don't know if that makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2833" target="_blank">00:47:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, as someone who was like a casual interest in DJing, like when do we see Suno DJs, right? Like that can continuously segue into like the next song, the next song, the next song.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think soon. And then maybe you can turn it collaborative. I think so. Okay. Maybe part of your roadmap. You teased a little bit your V3 model. I'm just wondering like how you incorporate like user feedback, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you have the classic thumbs up and down buttons, but like there's so many dimensions to the music. Like, you know, I didn't get into it, but some of the voices sounded more metallic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes that's on purpose, sometimes not. Sometimes there are kind of weird pauses in there. I could go in and annotate it if I really cared about it, but I mean, I'm just listening. So I don't, but there's a lot of opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We are only scratching the surface of figuring out how to do stuff like that. And for example, the thumbs up and the thumbs down for other things like sharing telemetry on plays, all of these things are stuff that in the future, I think we would be able to leverage to make things amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I imagine a future where, you know, you can have your own model with your own preferences. And the reason that's so cool is that you kind of have control over it and you can teach it the way you want to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, the thing that I would liken this to is like a music producer working with an artist giving feedback and like this is now a self-contained experience where you have an artist who is infinitely flexible, who is able to respond to the weird feedback that you might give it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't have that yet. Everybody's playing with the same model, but there's no technological reason why that can't happen in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We had a few more notes from random community tweets. I don't know if there's any favorite fans of Suno that you have or whatnot. DHH, obviously, notorious tweeter and crowd inflamer, I guess. He tweeted about you guys. I saw Blau is an investor. I think Karpathy also tweeted something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Return to monkey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, return to monkey, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2960" target="_blank">00:49:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a story behind that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He just made that song and it just speaks to him. And I think this is exactly the thing that we are trying to tap into that you can think of it. This is like a super, super, super micro genre of one person who just really liked that song and made it and shared it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it does not speak to you the same way it speaks to him. That song really spoke to him. And I think that's so beautiful. And that's something that you're never going to have an artist able to do that for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you can do that for yourself. And it's just a different form of experiencing music. I think that's such a lovely use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Any fun fan mail that you got from musicians or anybody that really was a funny story to share?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We get a lot. And it's primarily positive. And I think people kind of, on the whole, I would say people realize that they are not experiencing music in all of the ways that are possible. And it does bring them joy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll tell you something that is really heartwarming is that we're fairly popular in the blind and vision impaired community. And that makes us feel really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, very roughly, without trying to speak for an entire community, you have lots of people who are really into things like mid journey, and they get a lot of benefit and joy, and sometimes even therapy out of making images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is something that is not really accessible to this fairly large community. And what we've provided, no, I don't think the analogy to mid journey is perfect, but what we've provided is a sonic experience that is very similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that speaks to this community. And that is community with the best ears, the most exacting, the most tuned. And so, yeah, that definitely makes us feel warm and fuzzy inside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, excellent. I mean, it sounds like there's a lot of exciting stuff on your roadmap. I'm very much looking forward to sort of the infinite DJ mode, because then I can just kind of play that while I work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I would love to get your overall takes, like kind of zooming out from Suno itself, just your overall takes on the music generation landscape. Like, what should people know? I think you obviously have spent a lot more time on this than others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So in my mind, you shout out Volley and the other sort of Google type work in your Read Me and Bark. What should people know about what Google is doing? What Meta is doing? Meta released Seamless recently, an audio box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3110" target="_blank">00:51:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And what are the other, how do you classify the world of audio generation in the broader sort of research community?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people largely break things down into three big categories, which is music, speech and sound effects. There's some stuff that is crossover, but I think that is largely how people think about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The old style of doing things still exists, kind of single purpose models that are built to do a very specific thing instead of kind of the new foundation model approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know how much longer that will last. I don't have like tremendous visibility into what happens in the big industrial research labs before they publish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Specifically for music, I would say there's a few big categories that we see. There is license-free stock music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is like, how do I background music, the B-roll footage for my YouTube video or for full feature production or whatever it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a bunch of companies in that space. There's a lot of AI cover art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do I cover different existing songs with AI? And I think that's a space that is particularly fraught with some legal stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3183" target="_blank">00:53:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also just don't think it's necessarily the future of music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There is kind of net new songs as a new way to create net new music. That is the corner that we like to focus on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would say the last thing is much more geared toward professional musicians, which is basically AI tools for music production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can think many of these will look like plugins to your favorite DAW.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them will look like, you know, the greatest stem splitter that the market has ever seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The current stem splitters are the state-of-the-art are all AI based.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a market also that has just a tremendous amount of room to grow. If you just think about, I would say music has evolved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody told me this recently that if you actually think about it, music has evolved recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just much more things that are sonically interesting at a very local level and much less like chord changes that are interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3239" target="_blank">00:53:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you think about that, like that is something that AI can definitely help you make a lot of weird sounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is nothing new. There was like a theremin at some point that people like put an antenna and try to do this with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so like, I think this is just a very natural extension of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3252" target="_blank">00:54:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how we see it. At least, you know, there's a corner that we think is particularly fulfilling, particularly underserved, and particularly interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the one that we play in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome. I know we covered a lot of things, I think, before we wrap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You have written a blog post that can show about GoHard's Law of Impact in ML, which is, you know, when you measure something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">then the thing that you measure is not a good metric anymore because people optimize for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Any thoughts on how that applies to like LLMs and benchmarks and kind of the world we're going in today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3289" target="_blank">00:54:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, I think it's maybe even more apropos than when I originally wrote that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because so much we see so much noise about pick your favorite benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And this model does slightly better than that model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end of the day, actually, there is no real world difference between these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3306" target="_blank">00:55:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is really difficult to define what real world means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think to a certain extent, it's good to have these objective benchmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's good to have quantitative metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end of the day, you need some acknowledgement that you're not going to be able to capture everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, at least at Suno, to the extent that we have corporate values,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if we don't, we're too small to have corporate values written down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But something that we say a lot is aesthetics matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That the kind of quantitative benchmarks are never going to be the be-all and end-all of everything that you care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3341" target="_blank">00:55:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And as flawed as these benchmarks are in text, they're way worse in audio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3348" target="_blank">00:55:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, aesthetics matter basically is a statement that like at the end of the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3353" target="_blank">00:55:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what we are trying to do is bring music to people that makes them feel a certain way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And effectively, the only good judge of that is your ears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you have to listen to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is a good idea to try to make better objective benchmarks, but you really have to not fall prey to those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3373" target="_blank">00:56:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I can tell you, it's kind of another pet peeve of mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I always said, economists will make really good or do make really good machine learning engineers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3386" target="_blank">00:56:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's because they are able to think about stuff like Goodhart's Law and natural experiments and stuff like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that people with machine learning backgrounds or people with physics backgrounds

yeah, I mean, I'll tell you at Kensho, we actually used to go to big econ conferences sometimes to recruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYXjn-V7AEw&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And these were some of the best hires we ever made.</span></div><div class="c"><span
