And especially Microsoft acquisitions often don't work. GitHub at the time was on this decline. They hadn't shipped anything for many years. They had a bunch of different competition. So Nat, who had sold Zimian to Microsoft was appointed a CEO by Satya at the time.</p><p>And he really revitalized and energized GitHub. And he just wound up leaving a few months ago. GitHub is the forefront of innovation. Between GitHub and VS Code, Microsoft dominates the developer landscape. GitHub Copilot is maybe, when people ask me, "Hey, do you have an example of AI actually working at scale?" There's a non-trivial percentage of code in GitHub being generated by Copilot.</p><p>And it all comes to Nat. He did so many things really well. Came in, really focused on shipping very quickly, listening to the community, was out in front whenever there was a controversy. And the odds were against him. If I was a betting person in 2018, '19, I would have said, "Nat is going to fail." He succeeded.</p><p>He left GitHub a lot better than he found it.</p></div></div></body></html>
