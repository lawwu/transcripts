Finding what's best is sort of ridiculous. For example, if you go to Tokyo and you go to any of the really sushi expert aficionados that I know, if you say, Hey, I want to go to the best sushi restaurant, they're going to erase you from their phone.</p><p>Cause it's just like, you're just a dumb ass to them. It's so overreductive. I think what they want to say is like, do you understand the nuance and to understand that at any given moment, there might be like five to seven serving the best stuff that night. So a lot of it is like the feeling, the price range, right.</p><p>And I think doing the homework never hurts, but the best thing to do is. Just to go out there and do it yourself. And I think the hard thing clearly is people are on a budget and they, they can't go eat out all the time. So I think at that degree, it really doesn't hurt to go to the places that are like tried and true.</p></div></div></body></html>
