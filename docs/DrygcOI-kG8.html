yeah, let's go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the -- this is the first time we're doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm so excited and honored that all of you chose to, you know, take a day to spend it with us in the amazing lineup of speakers and sponsors that we have here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To hear and learn about agents and AI and everything that's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've tried to pull out all the stops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We made that video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was all AI-generated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've really tried to make it an incredible experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're really excited for what the day has in store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels incredible that we're doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Little over two years ago, we launched LangChain as an open source project, a nights and weekends thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was really born out of talking to folks who were building things with AI at events like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, that was a month before ChatGPT was launched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And after that, there was this huge explosion of interest in the space as people wanted to take these ideas that they saw and use them on their data in their company for their application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was clearly something that captured the imagination of folks who were building at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if, you know, the models were way worse than they are today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if there was still a lot of work to do, there was that spark of imagination and of interest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we saw a lot of people getting started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where LangChain was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was helping people get started building quickly these prototypes that could amaze and wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we saw that there was a lot of struggle when you tried to go to production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this has been a story that we saw relatively quickly, but it's continued to be the trend over the past two years or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easy to get something working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the magic of these LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're, you know, powerful and amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's hard to get that to something that's reliable enough to actually move the lever in real business applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's both bad because it's not easy, but that's also good because that means there's a lot of value to be created from everyone here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this delta between the ease of prototyping and the difficulty of getting this production is really what led us to turn what was an open source project into something more than that, into a company, and build a company around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a slide from the original -- not with the background, obviously, but the language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was from our original pitch deck when we were starting the company in terms of what we wanted to do, what the mission was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to make intelligent agents ubiquitous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We think that LLMs are amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We think they're super powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They can transform the types of applications that we can build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we think there's a lot of tooling that needs to be built around them to really help us take advantage of all their capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this was the mission that we set out with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And over the past few years of working with you all on these problems, we've learned a little bit about what that looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we've also learned that there's a lot left to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for a few minutes right now, I want to talk about some of the things that we've learned, but also where we're headed and what the next things we think are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are some of the ingredients of building agents?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's maybe start there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What goes into them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One core component is obviously prompting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The new things about agents are the LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why we're all here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you interact with LLMs, you prompt it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You send it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You send it some text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You get back some response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so being good at prompting is a core component of building these agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We also think that engineering is a core component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So our target audience is developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We think that there is a lot of engineering skills that go into building reliable agents, whether it's the tools that they're using and interacting with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's the patterns that they're using to do the data pipelines that bring the context to the LLM at the right point in time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's the deployment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of engineering that goes into building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of product sense and product skills as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is similar to the product engineer before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But now when we're building these agents, we're often building them to do workflows that a human or a group of humans would do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so having the product sense and intuition and skill to understand those flows and then try to replicate them with an agent is a really important skill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, there's some aspects of machine learning that are involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So most prominently with evals, we see this being a great way to test and measure these agents and capture the non-determinism with some metrics over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's other things like fine tuning as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's absolutely some aspect of machine learning here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the combination of all of these skills has really burgeoned into what we see being the agent engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this combines different aspects of all of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's early on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is still being defined how much and which of these areas are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we see this new profile of builder, which combines all of these, representing the agent engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we think about Langchain and the mission of the company, in order to make these intelligent agents ubiquitous, we want to support all the agent engineers out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we're a room full of agent engineers here, or at least people who are trying to be, who are moving in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is how we think of the personas that we're trying to speak to and empower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we think about that, I think one question that we ask ourselves is what will the agents of the future look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to see what those agents look like and then build tools to help build those agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's interesting to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why we're all here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as we think about what these agents look like, there are a few beliefs that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I want to walk through three of them which we think are more kind of like in the present now and then three of them which we think are in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first belief that we have is that agents will rely on many different models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So over the past year and the last few months specifically, there have been a lot of different models coming on to the playing field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They have different strengths and weaknesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them are really costly, but they can reason for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them are faster and they're better for specific tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them are great at reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them are great at writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's this whole ecosystem of models out there giving developers the choice to choose which model is best for them at a particular point in their agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So an agent might use many different models and we see that being an increasingly common thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really where we've turned the original LangChain package into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was a lot in the original LangChain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of it was aimed at making it easy to get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a big part of that was the integrations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really what we've focused and doubled down on in the past year or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've turned LangChain into a place for integrations of all types, but specifically for language models as we've seen this be the key component of building these applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's provided a stable ecosystem for interacting with all the different model providers and model options that are out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As we've really focused in on this being the core use case for LangChain, we've seen that the stability and focus that this has has caused LangChain to continue to grow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this speaks to the model optionality that developers want as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in the last month alone, LangChain did 70 million monthly downloads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's in the last month alone, not aggregate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see this trend where developers increasingly want the flexibility to switch between models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is interesting to not look at by alone, but also if you compare to a benchmark, which we all have in our mind when we think of Gen.ai, which is Open.ai, you know, they're what people think of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at their kind of like download stats over the last few months, you'll actually notice that LangChain, again, driven by the different model options that are out there, has actually become more popular in terms of Python downloads than the Open.ai SDK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this speaks to the fact that developers want model optionality, and they're choosing LangChain to get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The second belief that we have is that reliable agents start with the right context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does this mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So prompting is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The prompt that you construct to pass into the LLM will determine what comes out of the LLM that will determine the behavior of the agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This prompt isn't just one big string.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually made up of a bunch of different parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all these parts come from different places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they could come from a system message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They could come from user input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They could come from tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They could come from retrieval steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They could come from the conversation history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you construct this context that you're passing into the LLM, it's really, really important to be able to control exactly what goes in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that will affect what comes out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in order to provide this control and flexibility in this context engineering, we've started moving all of our agent orchestration over to LangGraph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we launched LangGraph a little over a year ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an extremely low level, unopinionated framework for building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no hidden prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no hidden cognitive architectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can create the flow of the agent that you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can do all the necessary steps to get the right context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can pass that in whatever form to the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have supreme control over kind of like all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this control ability to build the cognitive architecture that you want is a key selling point of LangGraph as the agent orchestration framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, on top of this control, we've tried to add in functionality that doesn't get in the way of adding the right context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So streaming, human-in-the-loop support, short-term memory and long-term memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't tell you how to use these things, but we give you low level primitives so that you can build it into the agent yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this focus on controllability has really helped LangGraph stand out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're recommending that all complex agent orchestration things be built on top of it now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The last belief that we have is that building agents is a team sport.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the two things I talked about so far, LangGraph and LangChain, are both aimed at developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're tools for engineers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we think there are all these different areas, prompting product machine learning, that are involved in building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, ideally one person, the agent engineer, would have all of these assets, but it's early on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're still figuring out what these means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so building agents is becoming a team sport.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way that we're helping with that, or trying to help with that, is LangSmith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So LangSmith, we think of observability, evals, and prompt engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we view this as a platform to bring everyone together to build agents as a team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do I mean by that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We see tracing and the observability that it provides as a really integral way for everyone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but especially product people, to see what's going on inside the agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see all the steps that are happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see the inputs and outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you're trying to replicate a human workflow that you understand, this provides the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like pane of glass into what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned evals being important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where the machine learning knowledge comes into play.</span></div><div

sets and run evals both offline and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:12:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, prompting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Prompting is a key part of building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a prompt hub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a prompt playground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">agents is a team sport, and there needs to be this platform for all these people of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=784"

here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to be hearing later

these come online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so agents are definitely here today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a number of these companies speaking about how they're building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll talk with Replit next, and CodeGen has obviously been the biggest space that's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">transformed, but we've seen a lot in customer support, in AI search, co-pilots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so agents are here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're possible to build it, and hopefully today, hearing the stories of a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who are building will show that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing that is happening that we see happening this year is agents that were built last year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are starting to get more and more traction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're starting to go to production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're starting to be used in larger scales by a lot of folks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think a cool stat that backs this up is if you look at some of the Lingsmith traction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've had in terms of traces coming in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that at the start of this year, there's kind of been this influx in just trace volume.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this speaks to the fact that agents not only are here, but they're being used consistently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and providing value to folks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are three beliefs that we've built up over the past few years about what it's like to build agents now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So where do we think the industry is headed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some beliefs we have about the future?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As we see more and more agents going into production, one of the things that we're starting to believe more strongly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that AI observability is different than traditional observability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I mean by that is when you're dealing with agents, you're getting all of these large, unstructured,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">often multimodal payloads that are coming in to a platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are some technical differences from traditional observability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But also what's different is the user persona that the observability logs are being used for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not built for an SRE.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're built for this agent engineer persona.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that needs to bring in some of these ML concepts, some of that product concepts, some of that prompt engineering context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and provide this different type of AI observability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've always had AI observability in Langsmith from traditional metrics to business metrics to more qualitative metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And today we're excited to launch a new series of metrics around agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So specifically, we're launching better insight into the tools that your agents are using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can track the run counts of tools, the latencies, the errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're also launching trajectory observability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see which paths your agents are taking and, again, the latency and errors associated with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is available today in Langsmith if you go and send a bunch of traces, you can start to see this populate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The next belief we have is that everyone will be an agent builder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we talk about this agent engineer, it combines these four different aspects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And realistically, right now, it's so early on that no one really is at the center of all of this and has all of these skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yes, we want to make it possible for people to collaborate and build agents as a team sport.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is Langsmith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we also want to try to move folks who are maybe in one of these quadrants in a traditional engineering background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or in a product background or in an ML background, move them more towards the center so that they can build agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we think about developers who don't have a background in AI and aren't familiar with this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how can we enable them to build agents more easily?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing that we've been building towards this, we've launched a few things over the past few months in this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is what we're calling Langraft pre-builds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are common agent architectures for the variety of different agent types that we see out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So single agents, agent swarms, supervisor agents, there's some other ones as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make it really easy for anyone who doesn't understand agents or is coming to it from an engineering background to easily get started with these common architectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At the next level, we want to make it possible for people who are on these product engineering teams, but maybe not developers themselves, to be more involved in building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the coolest things that we launched, maybe a year ago at this point, is Langraft Studio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today we're excited to give it a facelift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're launching Langraft Studio V2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No more desktop apps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can run it if you're not on Mac anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it comes with a bunch of improvements as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see all the LLM calls in a playground directly in the studio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can build up data sets here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can modify prompts as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can start to modify the agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think most excitingly is you can pull down production traces from LangSmith into your local LangGraph Studio so that you can start to modify the agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will then hot reload.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can kind of fix these production issues that you're seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, we want to make it possible for more and more people who aren't developers at all to build agents from scratch, not just on product engineering teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we think about folks at larger enterprises, there are often a number of tasks that they want to do and build agents for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's tough to get kind of like engineering resources to start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to make it more and more easy for folks to build agents in a no-code way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today we're launching open source open agent platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's powered by LangGraph platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It uses agent templates to allow people to build agents in a no-code way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes with a tool server that uses MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes with RAG as a service so you can easily get started with anything related to RAG.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it contains an agent registry so that you can see all the different agents that you've created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can check it out today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, the last belief we have is that deployment of agents is the next hurdle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's possible to build agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about what it looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you build an agent, you then need to deploy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes this can be easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes you can stand up kind of like a traditional kind of like web server and put it behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we see more and more that agents are looking a little bit different than traditional web apps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So specifically, they're often long running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We see agents -- deep research is a great example that takes 10 minutes to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We see agents that are taking an hour, 12 hours to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're often bursty in nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So especially if you kick them off as background jobs, you might be kicking them off hundreds or thousands at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're flaky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're flaky in a bunch of different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the calls to the LLM might fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But also, you want to have human in the loop because these LLMs might not do what you expect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you need some statefulness in these agents to allow this human in the loop or human on the loop interaction patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've seen these patterns crop up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We think that agents are going to become more and more long running, more and more bursty, and more and more stateful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to help people tackle this deployment challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Langraph platform, we launched in beta about a year ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And today we're excited to announce that it's officially generally available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's in Langraph platform, if you haven't checked it out, there are 30 different API endpoints that we stand up for everything from streaming to human in the loop to memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It scales horizontally so it can handle burstiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's designed for these long running workloads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can actually expose the agents that you deploy here as MCP servers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It also comes with a control plane where you can discover the agents that everyone at your org has deployed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can share agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can reuse these agents with templates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there are a few different deployment options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a cloud SaaS offering as well as hybrid and then fully self-hosted options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can try this out if you go to Langsmith today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're interested in any of the hybrid or fully self-hosted, feel free to get in touch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that wraps it up for the keynote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And before we go on to the next section, I want to thank a bunch of people because this is a fantastic event and I'm really grateful for a number of people who have made this possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Cisco customer experience is our presenting sponsor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll hear from them later on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They've done a fantastic job at building some really complex agents that are transforming how they do work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm excited for you all to hear more about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a bunch of incredible sponsors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I saw there was a lot of lines at the booths out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's in part because we have some of the most interesting agent companies in the world sponsoring this event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'd highly encourage everyone to go check them out and talk to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, we have some ideas of what the future will look like, but so do the people here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'd encourage everyone to go check them out and talk to them later on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.000</a></span>

target="_blank">00:23:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think everyone here is going to learn a ton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've tried really, really hard to bring together a collection of folks who have actually built agents and put them in production so that you can hear from them and learn from them what that looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrygcOI-kG8&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm really excited to hear a lot of these talks, and I hope you all are as
