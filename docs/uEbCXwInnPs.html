That technique is called generative pseudo-labelling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=13" target="_blank">00:00:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or GPL.

So we're going to be using GPL to take unstructured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">data and generate structured data from it for training sentence transformers. Now before we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">really dive deep into GPL, I want to give a little bit of background and set the scene of where we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">might want to use this sort of technique. So in 1999 there was a concept known as semantic web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">described by the creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee. Now Tim Berners-Lee had this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of dream of the web in the way that we know it today but where you have machines roaming the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">web and being able to just understand everything. But when you start to become a bit more niche,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it gets hard to actually find that sort of data set and pretty much impossible most of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example let's say you're in the finance industry, you have these internal documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fairly technical financial documents and you want to build a question answering system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">where people or staff can ask a question in natural language and return answers from those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">documents. It's going to be hard for you to find a model, you do have financial Q&A models but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">they've been fine-tuned on like personal finance questions on Reddit and okay kind of similar but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">not really. Like personal finance and technical finance documentation in a finance company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">very different. So it's very hard to actually find a data set that is going to satisfy what you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in that scenario because it's fairly niche. And it's not even that niche,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of companies that need to do that sort of thing. Another example is a project I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">worked on was for the Devay language. We wanted to create a set of language models for the Devay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">language which is the national language of the Maldives. Now there's not that many Devay speakers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">worldwide so it's pretty niche. So it's very hard to find labeled data and I think what we end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">doing is actually using unsupervised methods. We use TSAE for the actual sentence transformer model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">What we have there is another use case where it's fairly niche and it's hard to find labeled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">data for. But there is unlabeled data, unstructured data in both of those scenarios. In your finance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">company you have the documents there, you just don't have them, they're not labeled in a way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can train a model with. Or in the Devay language example we have, there is many web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pages in Devay that we can scrape data from but it's not labeled. So for these more niche topics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which covered a vast majority of use cases, you really either need to spend a lot of money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">labeling your data or we need to find something else that allows us to either synthetically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">generate data or just train on the unlabeled data. Now training on the unlabeled data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't really work. It works to an extent, TSAE showed that it can but you're looking at very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">generic semantic similarity and it's not perfect. GPL again, it's not perfect but it's definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">much better. So back to the semantic web example, in the case of the semantic web, the majority of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the semantic web is going to be these niche topics that we don't have labeled data for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">GPL is not a solution, it's not going to create the semantic web or anything like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it does allow us to actually target those previously inaccessible domains that actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">begin producing models that can intelligently comprehend the meaning behind the language in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">those particular domains which I think is super fascinating and the fact that you can actually do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this is so cool. Now there is a lot to it. This video I'm sure will be quite long but we really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to go into the details and I think by the end of this video you should know everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to know about GPL and you will certainly be able to apply it in practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've introduced where we might want to use it. I just want to now have a look at sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like an overview of GPL and where we are going to use it in this video. So GPL is, you can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it in two ways. You can use it to fine tune a pre-trained model. So when I say pre-trained,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean a transformer model that hasn't been fine-tuned specifically for semantic search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So a BERT-based case, for example, would be a pre-trained model from Hockey Base Hub. You take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that and you can use GPL to fine-tune it for semantic search. You'll get okay results with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that. The better way of using GPL is for domain adaption. So domain adaption is where you already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">have a semantic search model. So for example, what we are going to look at, we have a model that has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">been trained on MS Marco from data from 2018. This model, if you give it some questions about COVID-19,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">because 2018 was pre-COVID, it really kind of struggles with even simple questions. You ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it a simple question about COVID-19 and it will start returning you answers from about like Ebola</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and flu rather than COVID-19 because it's confused. It's never seen that before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a typical issue with sentence transformers. They're very brittle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and they don't adapt new domains very well whatsoever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So GPL is best used in these sorts of scenarios where we want to adapt a model to a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">domain. Now, as I said, our example is going to be COVID. We're going to teach this model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand COVID even though it's never seen anything about COVID before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's have a look at how GPL actually works. So at a very high level, GPL consists of three data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">preparation steps followed by one fine-tuning step. So the data preparation steps are the steps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that produce the synthetic data set that we then use in that fine-tuning step. So that fine-tuning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">step is actually a common supervised learning method. The unsupervised, if you want to call it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that, part of this method is that we are actually generating the text or the data that we'll be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">using automatically. We don't need to label it ourselves. So these three data preparation steps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">are the key to GPL. They are query generation, which is where we create queries from passages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">so like paragraphs of text. The second is negative mining. So that is an information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieval step where we retrieve similar passages to our positive passage, which is a passage from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">before that do not actually answer our query, or we assume they do not answer our query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the pseudo-labeling step kind of cleans up the data from those two steps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from those two earlier parts, and uses a cross-encoded model to identify the similarity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">scores to assign to our passages and query pairs that we've generated already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that process here. We start with P+, which means positive passage at the top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We pass that through a query generation model. We use T5 for this, and that generates queries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">or questions. That's passed through a dense retrieval step, the negative mining step,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which will hopefully return things that either partially answer or share many of the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">words with our query or positive passage, and therefore are similar but do not actually match</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to our query. And then we pass all of those, the query, the positive and negative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">through to our pseudo-labeling step, which is the cross-encoded step. Now the cross-encoded step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to produce a margin score. So that's almost like the difference in similarity between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">our query positive pair and our query negative pair. We'll explain all this in much more depth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">later on. I assume right now it's probably quite confusing. So no worries, we will go through all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of this. So as you've probably noticed, each of these steps requires a user of a pre-existing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">model that has been fine-tuned for each one of these parts. Now we don't need to have fine-tuned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this. They're general models. They don't need to have been specially trained for that particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">task with this particular domain, okay? These models are generally quite good at adapting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">new domains, which is why we're using them. So let's dive deeper into what I've just described</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and begin looking at the query generation step of GPL. So as I mentioned, GPL is perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for those scenarios where we have no labeled data, but we do need a lot of unstructured or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">unlabeled data, okay? So we need a lot of text data that is not labeled. That could be text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">scraped from web pages, from PDF documents, from anywhere where you can find text data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The only requirement is that this text data is actually relevant to your particular use case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">e.g. is in-domain. Now, if we consider the case of maybe we have a use case where we need to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a semantic search retrieval model for German finance documents. For the in-domain of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we might consider German finance news articles or German finance regulations, okay? They would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">be in-domain, but other documents like PyTorch documentation or English financial documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they are not in-domain at all. It's almost like if you imagine you're studying for an exam in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">one topic, like biology, and you start studying some chemistry papers for that biology exam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe some of that chemistry might be relevant, a crossover of your biology, but not much. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">never actually going to do that if you want to pass your exam at least. Now, in our examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in this video, we're going to be using the CORD-19 dataset, which is a set of papers that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think all of them are specifically about COVID-19, but I think most of them at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">mention COVID-19. There are a lot of files here. Let's have a look at the code we use to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">download that data. Okay, so we need to find the CORD-19 dataset from the Allen Institute of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's this website here. So it's not available, at least when I checked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it wasn't available on HuggingFace. Datasets are anywhere like this, so we need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pull it manually. So I'm just going to download that. We create this tar file, and essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to go explain all of this. I want to be quick through this a little bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but you will be able to find the link to this in the description. So you can just run this script,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but everything will be stored within this document parses PDF JSON file, which is just going to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">load of JSON files. There's a lot of them, 300, just under 340,000 of them, and they're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">be named like this, and they're going to look like this. So they each have these paragraphs in there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which we're going to pull in and use in our examples. So once we've actually downloaded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the test data, we're going to move on to the query generation code. So we have our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Core 19 data. We're going to read them from here. I use a generate function here. So we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">through, getting the text, and we're just yielding the passage. So this is one passage at a time. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">one paragraph takes that time that I'm pulling in, and I'm using a generate function here to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, just be aware there are a lot of duplicates in this data set. So what I've done is create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this passage dupes set. So just check every time we have a new passage, we just check if we already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pulled it in. If so, we skip, move on to the next one. Otherwise, it's a unique passage, and we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">pull it in and add it to that duplication check, and then yield it. So using yield here, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a generate function that we loop through one at a time. So basically, we're going to iterate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">through that function, and it will return as one passage at a time, which is what we're doing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I returned two passages here. You can see they're pretty long. So there is a lot of text data in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there. We're probably going to cut a lot of it out when we're feeding it into our models. That's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We just want to see how this method works. We want to make everything perfect. So what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do is use this model here. So this is a T5 model trained on data from MS Marko</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from 2018. So it's pre-COVID. It doesn't know anything about COVID. We're using Hug and Face</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Transformers here, Auto Tokenizer, and then Automotive Sequence-to-Sequence Language Modeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing, just to be very aware, if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, definitely try and use it. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">here we're just moving that model to CUDA, to our GPU. It will make things much quicker. This step,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise, on CPU, will take a very long time. So it's best not to. If you can, it's best not to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that. I think for me, on the Tesla V100, I think this took maybe one or two hours to do for 200,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">examples, which is a fair few. So here's just an example of what we're going to do here. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">taking one passage. We are going to tokenize the passages to create our inputs. And now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">inputs will include the input IDs and attention masks. We need both of those. And we feed them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">into our model. And this generates three queries from that. One other thing that you really should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">make note of here is, again, I'm moving those tensors to CUDA, if I can. If I move my model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to CUDA already, these also need to be on CUDA. And let's have a look at what we produce from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not good. It really depends. I think this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a relevant example. But it's not perfect, because the queries are about SARS here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than COVID, even though we're talking about COVID. Obviously, the model doesn't know that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this generative step, or query generation step, is very good for out-of-domain topics. Because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, if this said COVID-19, I think there's a good chance that this would say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where is COVID-19 infection found? Because it does a lot of word replacement. So it's seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your answer, basically. And it's just kind of reformatting that answer into a question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about the answer. That's a lot of what this T5 model is doing. So it can be quite good. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in some cases, it can be less good. But that's fine, because it's better than nothing. We really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">do need some sort of labeled data here. And in most cases, it works fairly well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So here, we get some OK examples. We have SARS rather than COVID. But otherwise, it's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm doing here is I'm creating a new directory called data, where I'm going to store</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the synthetic data we create. Importing TQDM for the progress bar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">setting a target of 200,000 pairs that I want to create. Batch size, increase as much as you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to make it quicker. But obviously, it's restricted, depending on your hardware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And just specify a number of queries. And we're going to do this all in batches to make things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit faster. And then we reinitialize that generator. That's going to return as our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">passages. Because we've already run through three of them already. So I just want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">restart it, essentially. So we're going to go through. I'm using this with TQDM as progress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Because this is a generator, we don't know how long it is. So it's not going to give us a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">good progress bar if we just run TQDM on passages. So I'm specifying the total as a target. So total</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">number of steps is the target that I have up here, the 200,000. So I'm going to increase the count by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">one with every new passage that we generate queries for. In fact, I'm going to increase it by three,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think. Yeah, because we create three queries per passage. So we do do that. And once our count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is greater than or equal to the target, 200,000, we stop the whole process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Here, for the passage batch, I'm appending a passage. So the passage that we have from here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just replacing any tab and newline characters to keep it clean for when we're writing the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">later on, more than anything. Because we're going to be using tab-separated files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to encode everything in batches. So once the length of the batch is equal to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the batch size that we specify up here, so 256, we're going to begin encoding everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we tokenize everything in the batch, and then we generate all of our queries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, generating three for each passage that we have. And then another thing is that we need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">decode the queries that we've generated to human readable text. Because the next model we use is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be a different model. So it cannot read the same tokens that this model outputs. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">need to decode that back to human text. And then we're going to loop through all of the decoded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">outputs, which is one query per line. And we have to consider there's actually three queries per</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">passage. So we have maybe five passages here, and that means we have 15 queries on the other side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to consider that when we're pairing those back together. So we use this passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">IDX, which is the integer of I divided by number of queries. So imagine you have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so we have for passage 0, we are going to have queries 0, 1, and 2. 0, 1, and 2, you divide those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">by 3. And all of them are going to be less than 1. So 2 is the highest one. 2 divided by 1, 0.66.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you take the integer value of that, it's going to become 0, which maps to the passage on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">side. So that maps to passage number 0. So that means 0, 1, 2, all mapped to passage 0. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we do the next one, so 3, 4, 5. And that's going to map to 1. So that's how we're mapping our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">generated queries back to our passages. And then for each one of those, we just append it to line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">here. We're using a tab to separate them because we're just going to write them to file. And we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">increase the count. Refresh the batch every time we've been through a batch. And update the progress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">bar. So updating it, actually updating it by 3 here. No, sorry. Updating it by the size of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">decoded output. So if we had five passages, that would be 15 because we have three queries per</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">passage. OK, now we want to write those query passage pairs to file, which we do like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so that's the query generation set. There's a lot in there. But from this, we now have our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">query passage pairs. Now, it is worth noting that, like we saw before, query generation is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect. It can generate noisy, imperfect, super nonsensical queries. And this is where GPL improved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">upon GENQ. If you know GENQ, we covered it in the last chapter. And GENQ just relies on this query</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">generation step. GPL, later on, we have this pseudo-labeling step, which kind of cleans up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">any noisy data that we might have, or at least cleans up to an extent, which is really useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's great. We've finished with our query generation step. And now we're ready to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">move on to the next step of negative mining, which I think is probably one of the most interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">steps. So now, if you think about the data we have, we have our queries and the assumed positive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">passages, or the positively paired query passages that we have in the moment. Now, suppose we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tune our sentence transformer or bind coder with just those. Our sentence transformer is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">going to learn how to put things together. So you're going to learn how to place these queries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and passages in the same vector space. And yes, OK, that will work to an extent. But the performance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is not great. And what we need is a way to actually find negative passages. So there was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">paper on Rocket QA. And they found that when-- or they had this really cool chart that I liked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">where you have your performance, or model performance, when they've trained it with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hard negatives. So negative samples are quite hard for the model to figure out that it's negative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's very similar to your positive. And we'll explain more about hard negatives later on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And where they train the model without any hard negatives, so just the positives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very clear that models perform better when there are hard negatives. It's almost like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you can think of it as making your exams harder. The people that pass the exams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">now will have studied even harder than they would have in the past. Because you've made the exam</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">harder. They need to study harder. And as a result of that, they will be better because of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Their knowledge will be better because the exam was harder. And they had to try harder to pass it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very similar in why we include negatives. It makes the training process harder for our model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the same time, the model that we output from that is much better. So to actually get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">these negatives, we perform what's called a negative mining step. Now, this negative mining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">step is used to find highly similar passages to our positive passages that are obviously very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">similar but are not the same. So we are assuming that these very similar passages are-- maybe they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about the same topic, but they don't really answer our query. We're assuming something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this. We don't actually know, but we're assuming this. So we're performing a semantic search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">information retrieval step to actually return these possible negatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can use them as negative training examples. So now what we will have is our query,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">positive passage P plus, and assumed negative passage P minus. And the result of this is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">our model is going to have to learn very nuanced differences between that negative or assumed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">negative and that positive in order to be able to separate them out and understand that, OK,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the positive is the pair for our query, but this negative, even though it's super similar, is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the pair for our query. So it's just giving our model an extra task to perform here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, with all that in mind, we also need to understand that we're assuming that all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">passages we're returning are negatives. We don't actually know that they are. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this is something that we're going to handle later on in the pseudo-labeling step. But for now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we just assume that they are, in fact, negative passages to our query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's move on to the actual implementation of negative mining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing we need to consider for this negative mining step is that there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">two parts to it. There is an embedding or retrieval model. Again, we're going to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something that has been trained on data from pre-COVID times. And what that is going to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is taking our passages and our queries and translate them into vectors. OK, but we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere to store those vectors. So we need a vector database to do that. So we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">use a vector database to store all of those vectors. And then we're going to perform a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">search through all of those with our queries in order to identify the most similar passages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to say, OK, is this a positive passage for this query? If not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">then great. We're going to assume it's a negative passage for our query. We're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go through and do that. So the first thing we're going to do is load our model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're using this MS Markov Silver Base TASB. Again, that is a pre-COVID data that has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">trained on. And we're loading that into Sentence Transformers and just setting the max sequence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">length to 256 here. OK, and then we're going to initialize a Pinecone index. So this is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">be our vector database. We're going to store all of our vectors. So for that, we do need an API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">key. It's all free. You don't need to pay anything for this. All the infrastructure and stuff is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">handled for us, which is great. So we go to @pinecone.io, make an account if you need to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you'll get an API key. Now, for me, it's not the best way to do it. It's just easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just storing my API key in a file called secret in the same directory as my code. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just reading that in here. OK, so my API key. Oh, as well, another thing you need to do here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is to install that, you need to pip install pinecone-client. OK, not pinecone, pinecone-client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we initialize pinecone with our API key. This is just a default environment. There are other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">environments available if you want to use them, but I don't think you really need to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we create the index. OK, so we have a native mining index. So here, I'm just saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you can check your currently running indexes with pinecone list indexes. If native mine is not in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there, then I'm going to create native mine index. And there's a few things you need to pass, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">dimension. The dimension is what we have here, so that the embedding dimension that our model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">embedding model is outputting. So you specify that, 768. The metric, this is important. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">need to be using dot product metric here for GPL. And also, the number of pods. So by default,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this is one. What you can do is increase this. So I think I increased it to 70, which is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like massively overkill for this. But that shortened. So with one, I had a runtime,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, of one hour 30 or one hour 40 with 70, which again, it's probably overkill. Maybe 40</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">would do the same. I don't know. With that, it was, I think, 40 minutes. So a lot faster,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but you do have to pay for anything that's more than one pod. So I know if you're in a rush,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then fair enough, fine. Go with that. Otherwise, you just sit with one pod. It's free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And then you connect. So you, this creates your index, and then you connect to your index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So pine cone index, negative mine. Okay. And then we want to go through, we're going to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">our model. Actually, this bit here, we're creating our file reading generator. So it's just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">yield the query and passage pairs. I include this in here because I got a value error because there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">some weird, literally one row of weird data in there. So I just added that in there to skip that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">one. And yeah, initializing that generator. And then here, I'm going to go through and actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">encode the passages. So you see, we're creating a passage batch here. We're doing it in batches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">again, make it faster. So I'm adding my passages to the passage batch, also adding IDs to the ID</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">batch. And then once we reach the batch size, which is 64 in this example, we encode our passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">batch. We also convert them to a list because we need it to be a list when we're upsetting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. So upset just means, it means update or insert. It's just like database lingo. We need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it to be a list when we're pushing this because it's pushing it through an API call here, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">JSON request. So we need to convert that to a list rather than NumPy array, which is, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the default. And then we just create a list of ID and vectors and upload that to PyCone, our index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we just refresh those batches. So we start again, and then we do 64 and then do the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">encode and upset again. And then at the end here, I just wanted to check the number of vectors we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have in the index. So we see the vector, the dimensionality of the index, so as the index</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">fullness, this will tell you pretty much how quick it's going to run. At zero, it's perfect. It means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's basically empty. It'll run pretty quick. And then you have the vector count here. So remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we have 200,000 examples or pairs, but not all of them are being used. So they are all being used,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but not all of them are unique because for each passage that we have, we have three queries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So three unique queries, but three duplicated passages. So obviously, out of those 200,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">passages that we have, we need to divide that by three to get the actual number of unique passages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have in there, which is something like this 76840. So the database is now set up for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">us to begin native mindset. It's full of all of our passages. So what we're going to do is loop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">through each of the queries in pairs, which we created here. So we're going to loop through all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of those here in batches of batch size again, so 100. And we're going to initialize this triplets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">list where we're going to store our query, positive and negative. At the moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we just have query positive, remember? So we're going to go through there, get our queries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">get our positives, and we're going to create the query embeddings. So that's in batches again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we search for the top 10 most similar matches to our query, and then we loop through all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">those. So for query, positive passage, and query response, this query response will actually have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the 10 possible or the 10 high similarity passages for that query inside there. So extract those,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">remember? 10 in there. And I'm just going to shuffle those. So I'm going to shuffle them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we're going to loop through them. Now, we do this so that we're not just returning the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">most similar one all the time, but we're returning one of the most similar top 10 instead. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we extract native passage from that one record that hit. And then one thing we really need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">consider here is, OK, if we've got all of our passages in there, we're also going to have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">positive passage for our query as well in there. So it's pretty likely that we're going to return</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that, at least for a few of our queries for sure. So we need to check that negative passage we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at does not match to the positive passage for that query. And then if not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">then that means it's a negative passage or assumed negative passage, and we can append</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it to our triplets. So we have query, tab, positive, tab, negative. And then we say then file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">OK? Now, one last thing. Before we move on, we should delete our index. So if you're on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">free tier, you're just using that one pod, it's fine. You're not going to pay anything anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I guess it's also good practice to remove it after you're done with it. But if you are paying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, you want to do this so you're not spending any more money than you need to. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the negative mining step. Now we can move on to what is the final data preparation step,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the pseudo-labeling. Now, pseudo-labeling is essentially where we use a cross-encoder model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of clean up the data from the previous two steps. So what this cross-encoder is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is generate similarity scores for both the query positive and the query negative pairs. OK?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we pass both those into cross-encoder model, and it will output predicted similarity scores</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for the pairs. So first thing you need to do is actually initialize a cross-encoder model. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this should have been trained on pre-COVID data. And then we're going to use a generate function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">as we have been doing throughout this entire thing, just to read the data or the pairs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">triplets in this case, from file, and then yield them. And what we're going to do is use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">cross-encoder, using this function here, to calculate both the similarity of the positive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and the negative. And then we subtract those to get the margin between them, so the separation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">between them, which is ideal for when we're performing margin MSC loss, which we will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">very soon for fine-tuning our model. So we go through using our generator here. We get a line,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a time, a query, positive, negative. We get a positive score, negative score, and then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">calculate the margin between them. And then we're going to append those to label lines and save it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">all to file. So it's a pretty quick step, actually, for the pseudo-labeling step. But this final step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is also very important in ensuring that we have high-quality training data. Without it, we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">need to assume that all passages returning negative mining step are actually negatives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're irrelevant for our particular query. In reality, this is obviously never the case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because some negative passages are obviously going to be more negative or less negative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">than others. And maybe some of them are not even negative in the first place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was this chart or example from the GPL paper that I really liked. I've just adapted it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2263" target="_blank">00:37:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for our particular use case. So the query is, what are the symptoms of COVID-19? The positive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so the first row there, is COVID-19 symptoms include fever, coughing, loss of sense of smell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or taste. So that positive passage is the passage that we started with. We generated that query in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the generative or query generation stage. And then we retrieved these negatives in the negative mining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stage. Now, just have a look at each one of these. So the first one, fever, coughing, and a loss of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sense of smell are common COVID symptoms. That is not actually a negative. It's a positive. But this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is very likely to happen in the negative mining stage, because we're returning the most similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">other passages. And those other very similar passages could very easily be actual genuine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">positives that are just not marked as being the pair for our query. We don't actually know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they're negatives. So in this case, this is a false negative, because it should be a positive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the next one, we have these easy negatives. The next one, symptoms are physical or mental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">features that indicate a condition of disease. Now, this is a pretty typical easy negative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because it has some sort of crossover. So the question is, what are the symptoms of COVID-19?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is just defining what a symptom is. But it's not about COVID-19 or the symptoms of COVID-19.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an easy negative, because it mentions one of those keywords. But other than that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not really similar at all. So it will be quite easy for our model to separate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it will be easy for it to look at this easy negative and say, OK, it's not relevant for our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">query. It's very different to the positive that I have here. That's why it's an easy negative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Next one, another easy negative is COVID-19 is believed to have spread from animals to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">humans in late 2019. Again, it's talking about COVID-19, but it's not the symptoms of COVID-19.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe it's slightly harder for our model to separate this one. But it's still a super easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">negative. And then we have a final one. So this is a hard negative. Coughs are a symptom of many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">illnesses, including flu, COVID-19, and asthma. In this case, it's actually a partial answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because it tells us, OK, cough is one of the symptoms. But it's still not an answer. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">asking about the symptoms. We want to know about multiple symptoms. This is kind of partially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">answers, but it doesn't really. And what I really like about this is we look at the scores on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right here. We have the scores when you're using something like pseudo-labeling from GPL,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and scores when you're not using pseudo-labeling, like if you're using GenQ. Now, GenQ, even so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like for the false negative, GenQ is seeing this as a full-on negative. So you're just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">confuse your model if you're doing this. If it has two things that are talking about the same thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you're telling your model, actually, one of them is not relevant, your model is just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you're really going to damage the performance of your model from doing that. And it's the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with the other ones as well. There's almost like a sliding scale of relevance here. It's not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">black or white. There's all these shades of gray in the middle. And when using GPL and pseudo-labeling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we can fill in those shades of gray, and we can see that there is a sliding scale of relevance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Without pseudo-labeling, we really miss that. So it's a very simple step, but really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for the performance of our model. Okay, so we now have the fully prepared data, and we can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">move on to actually fine-tuning our sentence transformer using margin MSC loss. Now, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning portion is not anything new or unique. It's actually very common. Margin MSC loss is used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for a lot of sentence transformer models. So looking back at the generated data, we have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">format of Q, positive passage, negative passage, and margin. Let's have a look at how those fit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2518" target="_blank">00:41:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">into the margin MSC function. So we have the query, positive, negative. We pass those through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We get the similarity here. So this is our similarity of the query and the positive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, and this is this bi-encoder here is the one we're training, by the way. So this bi-encoder is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the final model that we're fine-tuning, that we're trying to adapt to our new domain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we also calculate using the query and negative vectors here. We calculate the similarity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">between those to get the similarity of Q and negative. We subtract those to get this here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2565" target="_blank">00:42:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which delta hat is our predicted margin. With our predicted margin, we can compare that against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">our true margin, or we assume it's a true margin from our cross-encoder. And we feed those into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the margin MSC over here, loss function. So we have the predicted minus the true for each sample.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We square all of that to get the squared error. And then we're going over for all of our samples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">taking the average. And that is our margin MSC loss. Now, what is really nice is that we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2607" target="_blank">00:43:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">actually use the default training methods in the Sentence Transformers library for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because margin MSC loss is just a normal method. There's nothing new here at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">OK.

So we're just using normal torch data loader, nothing special here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We use empty cache here just to clear our GPU in case we have anything on there. So if you keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">running this script again and again, trying to get it working or just modifying different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2684" target="_blank">00:44:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters to see how it goes, you'll want to include this in here. The batch size. Batch size</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is important with margin MSC loss. The larger you can get, the better. I did see, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the sentence transformers documentation, it used something like 64. And that's hard. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to need a pretty good GPU for that. And to be fair, even 32, you need a good GPU. This is using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">one Tesla V100 for this. And it works. It's fine. So as high as you can get,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">32, I think, is good. Even better if you can get 64.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, we just initialize data loader. We set the batch size and we shuffle to true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the next step we want to do here is initialize the buy encoder or sentence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">transformer model that we're going to be fine tuning using domain adaption. So this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">same one we used earlier in the retrieval step. We're actually going to be taking that and fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">tuning it. So we set the model match sequence length here, again, as we did before. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we initialize the margin MSC loss function as we would with normal sentence transformers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we just run like model fit. We train for one epoch or actually, it depends. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">get better performance if you train for more. I'll show you. And I just do 10% of the warm steps here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2774" target="_blank">00:46:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like we usually do. And I'm going to save it. Same model name, but I've added COVID onto the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there. And this doesn't take long. I think this was-- maybe it was 40 minutes per epoch on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">test of V100. So it's not bad. Now, in terms of the amount of training steps you want to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">put your model through, with GPL, they did fine. So in the paper, there's a really nice chart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that shows that after around 10,000 steps, for that particular use case, it leveled off. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">performance didn't really improve that much more from there. However, I did find-- so I'm using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">200,000 examples. So one epoch for me is already 200,000 training steps, which is more. And I found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually training for 10 epochs-- I didn't test in between. I just went from one. And I also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2831" target="_blank">00:47:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">tested 10. I found that 10, actually, the performance seemed to be better. I didn't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">quantitatively assess this. I just looked at it qualitatively. And it was performing or is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">returning better results than the model that had been trained for one epoch. So for rather than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">200,000 steps, it had been trained for 2 million steps, which is a fair bit more than 100,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned here. But that's just what I found. I don't know why. I suppose it will depend very much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on the data set you're using in particular. But I would definitely recommend you just try and test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a few different models. The training doesn't take too long for this step. So you have the luxury of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">actually being able to do that and testing these different numbers of training steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I mean, once training is complete, we can actually test that model as we usually would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the model as well. So I can show you. So we have the model over on-- if we go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Hugging Face CO Models, maybe. So if you search in here, you go Pinecone. And one of these is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the model that has been trained on COVID. So hit this one here. So you can actually copy this. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just write-- I think it is-- it should maybe have an example. Ah, so you write this. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you from Sentence Transformers, import Sentence Transformer. And you just do model equals Sentence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Transformer in your model name, which in this case is what you can see up here, Pinecone MS Marco.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can test the model that I've actually trained here. Again, this was trained on 10 epochs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">not one. OK, so in this evaluation here, you can see what I was looking at. So load the old model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just the MS Marco, Silbert, Base, TUSB. And then here, I've got the model trained for one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">epoch. And here, the model trained for 10 epochs, which is equivalent to the model I just showed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you on Hugging Face Hub. So I've taken these tests. So we have these queries and three answers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or three passages for each one of those. Now, these are not even really perfect matches to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of data we were training on. But they're kind of similar in that they just include COVID-19.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so it's not a perfect match. It's not even perfectly in the domain. But it's good enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think. But I think that really shows how useful this technique is because it does work even with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of not perfect match between what I'm testing on and what I'm actually training on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So here, I'm just going through those. I'm getting the dot product score between those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and sorting based on that. So the highest rated passage for each query is returned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So for the old model, how is COVID-19 transmitted? We get Ebola, HIV. And then at the very bottom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we have Corona, OK? Again, what is the latest name variant of Corona? And then it's these here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, COVID-19 is right at the bottom. We have Corona lager right at the top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if the rest of the world calls it lager or beer, but I put lager there anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we say, OK, what are the symptoms of COVID-19? Then we get flu. Corona comes second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">here. And then we have symptoms at definition again. And then how will most people identify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that they have contracted the coronavirus? And then after drinking too many bottles of Corona</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">beer, most people are hungover, right? So obviously, it's not working very well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we do the GPL model. So this is the training on one epoch. We see slightly better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">results. So Corona is number one here. And then here, it's number two. So it's not great, but fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the symptoms of COVID-19? This one, I guess, right? So that's good. And then here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3070" target="_blank">00:51:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">how will most people identify that they have contracted the coronavirus? Again, it's doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the drinking too many bottles of Corona. Again, then you have COVID-19 second place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we have the model that's trained for 10 epochs. This one, every time. So number one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">number one, and number one. So it's pretty cool to see that. And yeah, I think it's super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting that this technique can actually do that using nothing more than just unstructured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">text data. So that's it for this video on generative pseudo-labeling, or GPL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I think it's already very impressive what it can do. And more importantly, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or what is more interesting for me is where this technique will go in the future. Is this going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3120" target="_blank">00:52:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">become a new standard in training sentence transformers, where you're building the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">synthetic data? I feel like there's really a lot that we covered in this video and from the GPL</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">paper to unpack and think about. We have negative mining. We have pseudo-labeling. We have all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">these different techniques that go together and produce this really cool, in my opinion, technique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbCXwInnPs&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can use super powerful.
