href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you have to be pretty stoked coming off those wins last weekend in San Francisco.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'm repping the Gator

for those that did watch the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That

the final few minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, to be honest, I was afraid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I didn't think there was a chance at this point because they were behind by so much as you were heading into the end of the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they basically, you know, scored four three-pointers, you know, against zero from the other side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They intentionally fouled and had missed free throws.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think someone said the Yahoo game predictor had it at, like, 98% Texas Tech with, like, very little time left on the clock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they somehow eked it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the bullish people will say, oh, you lived through something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you have confidence to deal with anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, the odds makers have put Duke in front of Florida at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And that started in the opposite place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, anyway, one game at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Super exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I was out in San Francisco at the Chase Center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Got to hang out with the coach a bit and some of the players' parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a good trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, since I'm in Austin, it's right down the street here to San Antonio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a lot of friends coming in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll see what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be a heck of a weekend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe if a certain couple teams end up in the championship game, I'll sneak in there on Monday night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess as long as we're repping and rolling, you know, I have two degrees, one from Florida and one from Texas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The Texas ladies are playing in the Final Four in Tampa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a lot of good stuff happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaking of a lot of good stuff happening, I think there are some people in the world that think a lot of not-so-great stuff is happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">based upon market reaction to the president's announcements of these tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, why don't we kick it off talking about Liberation Day?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're recording this right after Trump's presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you and I both watched it and then we jumped on the pod.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You've been talking about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's obviously been choreographed that this was coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, you've been saying for a very long time that Trump and his team are very serious about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than the argument that, oh, it's just a means to an end, you know, and a way to get a negotiation started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You have made the point that you believe that they believe this is actually where we need to take the economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And as such, you've been conservative and worried about where this would go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You gave a presentation last week on how to think about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">What did you talk about there?</span></div><div

Morgan Tech Conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It was pretty clear to me and you, we were talking about it in early Feb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this was doctrinal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, you know, there was a philosophical belief around trade that they wanted to, you know, create a more fair and level playing field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the real debate, you know, has been going on is like how big?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are a couple of different camps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so J.P. Morgan had this great event in Montana last week, 100 tech CEOs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, they had Howard Lutnick, Elon Sachs, Doug Bergram, all talking about, you know, various aspects of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And they asked me to do a little bit of a presentation on decoding the Trump economic agenda.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.180</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">You know, at the top, I think that all the CEOs in the room are pretty excited about the golden age that people have been talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, a pro-growth administration, pro-business, pro-investment, lower taxes, less regulation, pro-M&A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We've seen this M&A flywheel starting to kick up, this AI super cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But everybody's been pretty terrified about these tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the real question going into today, Liberation Day, was were tariffs going to land closer to the $600 billion trillion tariff level that Peter Navarro had been talking about and Howard Lutnick had been talking about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe at a little bit lower end of the spectrum, which we heard a little bit more from Scott Bessent and Kevin Hassett.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.220</a></span> | <span

landing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They both actually land, believe it or not, but it's like the glide path that we land here with tariffs and budget cuts matter a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, we got the news tonight.</span></div><div class="c"><span

larger end of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's no other way to slice it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a there was a headline that hit right after the market closed from the Wall Street Journal, I believe, that it was 10 percent across the board and the markets jumped up like two and a half percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div

started coming in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">People saw this chart that they presented on reciprocal tariffs, right, where they say tariffs on China going to 54 percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you believe that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Thirty four percent on top of the 20 percent that already exists.</span></div><div

the S&P futures, the Q, the Nasdaq futures start sinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They had a 600 basis point fall between where they initially jumped and where they ended up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the market is not liking this at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span

know, eight to 15 percent on the year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.580</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:06:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's kind of the initial reaction out of the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the pieces that I, you know, witnessed and I think everybody else did as well, maybe you have more data on it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is when they said reciprocal tariff, they kind of redefined what a tariff is for the reciprocal calculation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And they are including others, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know what else goes in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you know exactly what what fills this in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But but but basically the Trump administration is calculating an effective tariff, if you will, for each and every other country, which may not be the explicit tariff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, they call them non tariff trade barriers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is everything from what they call currency manipulation to things like judicial actions that restrict free and fair trade of our products into their countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, we know there are non tariff trade barriers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, it's not totally surprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you and I were to do the math on these, you can kind of make those numbers whatever you want to make them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, if I had to go through this, the tariffs largely break down into let's call it three or four big buckets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the auto tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's largely on Mexico, Canada and Germany.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the auto tariffs were imposed at 25 percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">This, you know, in fact, he had 20 members of the UAW union in the front row at the event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">He invited, I think, the president of the UAW up on stage to make some comments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said these people used to be Democrats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The Republicans now were the only ones who fight for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, this is really, you know, he said we won the state of Michigan because of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what I campaigned on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, these are the promises we made and we're delivering on the promises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It is striking to me that just politically, this is what Democrats were running on 20 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just shows how much the political parties have changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a big, you know, tariff differential as it relates to autos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Then he had the reciprocal tariffs, which are the ones that I outlined here, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, Trump is the negotiator in chief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the starting point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">All these tariffs go into place and we'll put these charts up on April 9th, country by country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going to hear all these ad hoc negotiations going on, some of which I'm sure, like Vietnam, he'll declare victory on even before we get to April 9th because they've already capitulated on a bunch of tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He's also declared that there are $6 trillion of new investments, right, that people have committed to in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">He mentioned NVIDIA, Apple, TSMC, SoftBank, OpenAI in his remarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, I particularly noted when he talked about SoftBank and OpenAI, he said great companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, for the people who are, you know, watching the battle between OpenAI and NX, that was notable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he said, we're going to have a minimum tariff of 10% on all countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So even if you're not on this list, we're going to have a minimum tariff of 10% on all countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, China is kind of in this bucket on its own, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to be a huge negotiation on its own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a lot of things that go into that negotiation, everything from, you know, the Panama Canal to the TikTok stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So set that aside, if you will, for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no way that lands, I think, at 54%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the headline tariffs, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">When we do the math and we add all of these up and, you know, say, what does this come up with, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The headline is we were at $77 billion last year, and we end up at about $750 billion, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, Peter Navarro, the hawk, the person who had been saying we're going to land big tariffs, he was estimating $600 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this definitely landed on the larger side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But then they came out right after that, and there was a footnote about things that were exempted from the tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Exemptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Exemptions, which included pharmaceuticals and, notably for you and I, semiconductors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So Taiwan's got a 32% tariff, but semiconductors are exempted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going through the value of those exemptions right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">My hunch is that this is going to land right around $600 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.040</a></span> | <span

open markets, free trade, and comparative advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's been studied for a very long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There are very solid mathematical arguments why, if you pull up the trade walls between multiple countries, that you're going to hurt the efficiency of both of them in the long run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, you know, at least from a theoretical perspective, I'm a believer in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's another issue for the markets and for the CEOs, which has to do with both the slow pace at which they could realistically respond to this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the amount of ambiguity that's been out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, let's say what the administration wants to encourage is for you to relocate a factory that you have, or let's call it production, that you have in Thailand, you know, and put it on the American shores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not a quick process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you start that process today, it might take three years, you know, before you'd have the type of volume that'd be capable of bringing that back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably at a higher cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one of the things that I've said over and over again, I don't think our labor is globally competitive, nor do I think it wants to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, even bringing it back, you're going to have a higher cost of production because we're going to have a higher cost of labor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That being said, you know, this ambiguity, you know, there's a lot of people even going right into this announcement that didn't know what percentage of it was real versus bluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's, I think, at this point, just reading the papers, not making my own assessment, the administration has a reputation of maybe some of this is for negotiation, maybe some of it's not real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you're left not knowing what's going to be the policy three months from now, six months from now, 12 months from now, which makes it very hard to allocate CapEx in any meaningful way whatsoever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's so well stated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You and I have said, you know, markets and business abhors uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

positive?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was literally texting with some big CEOs during the president's announcement, and they are asking questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=820"

target="_blank">00:13:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is just amazing to me, right, that you have this level of uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I was with those 100 CEOs in Montana last week, and I would say almost to a one, they said things are slowing down in February and March because nobody knows what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, you know, the Fed had just come out last week, had taken down their forecast for GDP growth, had taken up their forecast for inflation, had taken up their forecast for unemployment by the end of the year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the economy, you know, most major economists are increasing their probability of recession, are slowing the rate of growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think your point is, can I count on this, and how long can I count on this, and can I really plan a year out based upon this, or is this going to change yet again over the course of the year?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and by the way, there's cascading effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you're unsure about things like this, you're not going to hire a bunch of people, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You're probably going to pause hiring because you don't know, you know, you don't know how much earnings you're going to have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, those kind of things can proliferate downward and affect unemployment and eventually affect consumer spending just by freezing, you know, nearly everything in the economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me tell you two other cascading effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I heard from one of the CEOs last week that four contracts with him had actually been canceled, right, because they had like three European contracts canceled and one Asian contract canceled because the countries were so upset with America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that they're going to do deals instead with European countries, companies, or whatever the case may be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and then I saw a couple of tweets, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One was that, you know, China and Korea and Japan were actually going to collaborate in a response to the U.S. tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And somebody said, you know, we haven't seen the Koreans and the Japanese and the Chinese combined forces on anything since the Mongols caused them, you know, to get together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it is causing a lot of strange bedfellows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I sent you the tweet where the Europeans, the president of Europe, the president, Macron, they're all going to China and they want to talk about closer trade negotiations with China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And you warned us about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you said the meeting was in Vietnam.</span></div><div class="c"><span

predicted that that would happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yes, you know, there's no reason that that wouldn't happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of ramifications of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that anything came out of it that's going to be good for the markets and good for stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's more your world than mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I've always shunned macro analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me just maybe opine on that for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.900</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">After hours with the NASDAQ down, peak to trough post-Trump at almost 18%, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's down a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of names in the NASDAQ are down 40% or 50%.</span></div><div class="c"><span

market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody asked, and I said, as very rude, I do believe the president wants to do deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.600</a></span>

class="t">I think we're going to land the plane here closer to $300 billion or $400 billion in tariffs, not $600 or $700 billion, and certainly not a trillion in tariffs, even though it feels today like it was bigger than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things I think that's going to kind of force the president's hand, he talked at the press conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">He had a bunch of senators there and House members.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The senators and House members are hearing from their constituent CEOs that they don't like these tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, most important to the president, he wants to get this reconciliation package passed, which he calls a big, beautiful bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He wants to get this thing passed, which puts in place no taxes on tips and the permanency of the tax cuts, which he passed in his first administration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1070"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that that also is going to guide him a little bit more to the center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what, you know, we'll see whether the market believes that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.800</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">We're going to get a little bit more positive on the companies we like the best because we think some of this fear is now getting priced in.</span></div><div class="c"><span

out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think we're still in the fog of war, certainly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will be looking at, you know, do these exemptions on things like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals hold?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we seeing the country by country renegotiation on some of these things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably most importantly, Bill, it's really about China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">China

<span class="t">It scares me how big the tariffs are that we are suggesting are going to go in place on China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, it's imminent that he and she are going to have to talk and get a big trade deal done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those are the things I'm going to be watching for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.760</a></span> |

want to be if you want to purchase at the best prices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.240</a></span> |

another thing that we heard a lot about this week, Bill, speaking of China, is, you know, some developments in Chinese open source and some developments on the U.S. open source front, particularly with respect to these frontier models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.140</a></span> | <span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So help us unpack, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think strategically is going on in China with respect to these open source models?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen some people tweet that maybe that, you know, DeepSeq was forced into open source by Xi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think that's going on or is there something else going on here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, I mean, all this culminated in the past week with open AI moving, you know, are talking again about open weighted models, which is a, I think, a really important data point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So how did how do we get from where we were to where we are?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I read that same tweet and I think it was remarkably misplaced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">China has been supportive of open source for well over a decade now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look on most of the major open source products and look at the management page and who the sponsors are for these, like Linux, you know, you'll see many of the major Chinese companies have been there and been supporting it for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They've been accused of stealing tech IP for years.</span></div><div class="c"><span

best thing possible, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no one that can accuse us of IP theft because there is no IP ownership in an open source world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so having dealt with those accusations for probably 40 or 50 years, I think everyone in China, you know, the government and the entrepreneurs writ large view open source as a very positive movement for their country relative to the West.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they've been they've been in on it for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They're very adept at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They're very they're very big believers in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when we talked about the interview with the DeepSeek founder, I would say he had as much kind of emotional like his his entire emotional mindset was tied to open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like he believes in it and wants to support it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's I think that's an important backdrop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't think China got there in some calculated way or do I think it was some recent move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they embraced open source, you know, over a decade ago because it made a ton of sense for them in a world that had had pointed a finger at them from an IP standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me just double click on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what you're saying is they may have been fearful that they would have been cut off from other type of software products in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, there might have been export controls or other things put on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So they said, I may as well support Linux because I may not be able to get Windows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that that discussion happened a long time ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't recent, but I think it's important because that lays the foundation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That if that's a foundational belief among Chinese entrepreneurs and Chinese companies, then it's understandable that this new generation of entrepreneurs might also see the advantages of open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that I think people have to remember is that within also within the past decade and maybe 15 years, many U.S. companies have learned to use open source as a defensive tool rather than just an offensive tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the biggest companies out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If they get in a position where they feel like they're behind the eight balls, so they're not in a leadership position, they will embrace open source as an attempt to level the playing field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And a great example is Kubernetes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So Amazon took this huge lead with AWS in the hosted server business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone was afraid of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Google had a piece of technology called Kubernetes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It was orchestration that would allow you to move a workload if that became a standard from one large server vendor to another, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It basically created ease of distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could run on multiple clouds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They went to the Linux Foundation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They recruited IBM, a whole bunch of other people, got everyone behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it gained so much momentum that Amazon had to embrace Kubernetes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it worked and we don't have a monopolist in that cloud business right now, you know, perhaps because of that deft move made by Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But they did it with Android against Apple, you know, being notable one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And Meta did it with Llama here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They came to the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They weren't first to the table in the AI space, but they were disruptive with open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But one other thing I would point out about that type of move and attention, in addition to saying it's defensive, I think it's great for consumers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you study economics in business school, you know, there's this notion of pure competition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Like where do you have the most fluid competition, which leads to the lowest prices for a consumer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And certainly open source does that versus proprietary code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's just hyper competitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why it's disruptive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why people use it in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a huge backdrop to where we are today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's people that are really concerned about, you know, China technology getting underneath our products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether or

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Either way, if that gets traction, you have a window in the U.S. right now where someone might move to go left of DeepSeek in terms of openness on one of their models, either in an offensive or defensive move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's a short window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that or Meta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they have an

administration and what Washington, D.C. is going to do, my best sense is they do not want to see a Huawei DeepSeq Belt and Road, either with chips or with open source models.</span></div><div

you know, this gets back to the AI diffusion bill and how we're going to restrict these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they would love to see the world continue to run on, you know, U.S. compute, U.S. silicon.</span></div><div class="c"><span

around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They know it has a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They still have to compete with DeepSeq on a global basis.</span></div><div

plays out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I've already asked Clem at HuggingFace if maybe he will create a continuum so we can rank all these different models from an openness perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there's so many different facets by which you could be open or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, but actually, I had one more thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Since you're involved at OpenAI, you can correct me if I'm wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But you have been, you know, saying for, I would say, a couple quarters now that the real opportunity for OpenAI is on the product side versus the model side, which hints at being more of a consumer product than, say, the enterprise APIs business that they've also been in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">If they think that also, and I'm not involved, so this is a conjecture of my part, being more open with your model is a really deft move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it will put more pressure on other players to try and keep up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will allow your model to have more pervasive usage globally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And you talked about running out of compute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the minute you put that model out where other people can download it, they're doing that on their servers, not on yours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just think it's a very clever move for the same reason Google would have supported Kubernetes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You're kind of wiping out the business opportunity for other models to play on the API side if you make yours open, which helps protect the competitive flank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And once again, great for consumers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think it's, I think, you know, it makes sense on a bunch of fronts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">On the first front, I think they want developers to develop on their platform and build applications for, you know, for open AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.380</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">Number two, I think that they fundamentally have a view that they want to build, you know, they want to build products and applications that move humanity forward with AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is another way to do it

in the enterprise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were on BlackBerry and they all switched to iPhones because they loved using them at home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the natural thing for them to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not to say enterprise is going to be a battle.</span></div><div

on building a big enterprise business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.320</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:34:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There's probably a product that people buy user licenses for, for doing, you know, white collar research type work.</span></div><div

very relevant, like having the UI they're used to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the separate side, which is models that underlie the type, you know, types of business processes that you're building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, one of the things you pinged me on this week was the investment round around OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I'm happy to

happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">What was announced?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, I mean, they announced the long rumored investment that was led by SoftBank, which many people described in the headline as a $40 billion investment round.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you read the breakdown of it, it's, you know, it comes in a couple tranches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The first tranche being closer to $10 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The second tranche being closer to $30 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's an extraordinary amount of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's bigger than any, bigger than I think the largest IPO sans maybe one or two that has ever been done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I've often described these as private IPOs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Altimeter participated along with several others who were reported.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And the valuation was like $260 pre, which would make it, if all the money were to come in, a $300 post valuation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it certainly got a lot of attention this week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, you asked me the question, I think, Bill, just around kind of valuation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">How did we think about valuation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing I would say is market leaders never look cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">When I invested in Google in 2005, when I invested in, you know, Meta, when the IPO broke and we looked at those late stage private rounds, I certainly remember the Microsoft round in a Meta at $15 billion that was roundly criticized as being incredibly expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">None of these things, you're certainly not going to buy a market leader on the cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you really look at this, I think that they've said publicly they expect their revenues this year to be around $13 billion, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">To do $13 billion in revenue probably means you have to exit the year closer to $15 to $18 billion in run rate revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So as I look at this on a forward run rate for this year, you're paying something like, you know, 20 times revenue for the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we also had a couple other announcements, you know, this week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, you know, there's the Anthropic funding round and there's talk that they're doing a billion to $2 billion in revenue, a $60 billion funding round.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So that to me looks like something like 50 times revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, you got OpenAI at 20 times, Anthropic at 50 times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we had the merger of X and X.AI, which are rumored to have around, let's call it $3 billion in revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the combined market cap there is like $125 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that looks like closer to 80 times revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So the market leader here, which usually trades at a premium, not at a discount, to me, you know, again, we can argue about the sustainability and could somebody disrupt them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And is 20 times a good valuation in this environment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, but aren't they spending a lot of money on compute?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And is it really high value revenue?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But apples for apples relative to their peers, it certainly appears to me like, you know, 20 versus 50 versus 80.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's hard to say that this would be more expensive on a multiple basis than Anthropic or X.AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2263" target="_blank">00:37:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also read that there are still contingencies on whether the full conversion from a nonprofit to a for-profit happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there's some stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If that's true, there's still some stuff to play out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, one thing I would say when I witnessed this from afar, and once again, you're involved, I'm not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So correct me if I'm wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2284" target="_blank">00:38:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, having lived through the Uber Lyft situation, which oddly had Masa coming to the table also, you know, our world has just evolved into one where so many people believe in power at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So many people believe in network effects and that these markets are winner take all that you end up with these massive capital raising rounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it's not lost on me that both with Stargate and with this one, the headline number is bigger than, you know, the piecemeal when you start to unpack it, which, you know, for better or for worse, from my position, smells of being promotional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, and so why would you do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are you trying to have a bigger headline number?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that number does get repeated in the press.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it does work in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I come back to, you know, I suspect the company's sending a message to Anthropic and anyone else in the game that we're here for the long haul.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2343" target="_blank">00:39:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, they probably didn't anticipate all the moves that Elon's made with X and Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously that is another deep pocketed player.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But, but boy, you know, if you're, if you're on the Anthropic, you know, investment, you know, side, I, you know, I'd be scared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, like, you know, and I've lived through this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a, it is a, uh, a sport of Kings, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then lastly, one thing that naturally falls out of that is unit economics get postponed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to believe in the power law and the network effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They've, in addition to that headline number, you know, I think they've said publicly, they expect to lose, you know, five to 7 billion this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, with an employee count of the, I think six to 7,000, that's not going to run you more than a billion or two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's some number between the revenue number you talked about and subtracting 2 billion for expenses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the rest is your operating cost of keeping this AI machine going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I ran some loose numbers and I come up around 15 or 20 bucks a year for a non-paid user, you know, just to, to run the servers on their behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, eventually you might get to advertising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.840</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:40:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">These are, these are things we've seen play out over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2428" target="_blank">00:40:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They played out with ad models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But once again, if you're going to try and lay chase to them, um, you got to be prepared to underwrite that cost yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.780</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">Um, but the fact of the matter is at least as to this one, and I'm not going to get into the other, you know, valuations for the other models, but I'd say at least as to this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2659" target="_blank">00:44:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I was an early investor in

target="_blank">00:44:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would just say to you that, you know, what I see out of ChatGPT reminds me a lot of kind of those winner-take-all consumer applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not

be assaulted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Grok has been a great model, you know, launched by Elon, but I think they really do have a big moat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2690"

growing a lot faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, I think that the consumer business here will ultimately be valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But to your point, the unit economics can be crap along the way, and it's up to the company to launch the things like advertising, pace, you know, different pricing tiers, et cetera, that, you know, bring all of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me ask you a question since you went down that avenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they've announced, is it 20 million paid users and 500 million total users?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have a 4% conversion rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you think about paid versus advertising that conversion rate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">What is, how do you think about the business model with those facts on the table?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, honestly, I think that right now we probably, you know, we're throttling ChatGPT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you bring on more compute, all those numbers would be higher, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If you just have more compute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Secondly, I think most of ChatGPT users are using a model that's like a year old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we haven't been able to upgrade the, they haven't been able to upgrade the models because I don't think they can support the things they want to do in the upgraded models from a GPU perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So my suspicion is when they're able to do that, that they're going to have a lot more flexibility around things like pricing tiers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Sam has said he doesn't particularly like advertising, but at some point they will obviously have something that they think is beneficial to consumers that will be around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at operator, if I say to operator, book me the Four Seasons Hotel in New York next Tuesday and it does that for me, which I think they're getting a lot closer to you and I have this back and forth on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2796" target="_blank">00:46:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, let's just stipulate that even you believe at some point they're going to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we're driving that kind of value for users, either the user will pay or the end merchant will pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there are all sorts of business models that will evolve around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So my hunch is you're going to see a mixture of advertising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to see a lot of different pricing tiers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to see models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we're going to have this, you know, this long menu of model choices that forces the consumer to understand the difference between O4 Mini and O3 and O1 and, you know, all these different models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2828" target="_blank">00:47:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you're just going to have a smart model, ChatGPT5 or ChatGPT6, that may be coming sooner rather than later, that's just going to make those choices for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2838" target="_blank">00:47:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think there are a lot of ways –</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, you know, we've talked about this in the past, but I've often felt that one of the reasons that Google is so susceptible to disruption is how they've maximized the revenue per visitor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I personally don't think there's any way when that world you're talking about, that agent world evolves, that that partner in a hotel is going to pay a fee anywhere close to the fee that's paid to Google by someone that's marketing a service that I always say using LTV math versus transactional math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I just

they're one of the largest advertisers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.520</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:48:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's been reported that Google generates – it's one of their largest advertising categories in the world is travel, hotels specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Booking is one of their largest global advertisers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you sell a $100 hotel room and you take $20, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.200</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, actually, to be fair, in many circumstances, you know, they'll be using what I call LTV math and they'll pay –</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.240</a></span> | <span

class="t">Oh, they'll pay $50 instead of $20 because – and then they'll say, well, if the customer comes back twice in a year, we get to break even in the first year and we're going to hold them forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why that won't work in the agent world, which is no one's going to think that way because if you're a white-label service that's underneath the agent model, the most you can share is 10 of the 20, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Or whatever, you

that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Google's traded down

time we've actually had competition for Google, like very clear that competition is coming to all those categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we get around to talking about breaking up their search

bucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say it settles out at 10 bucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, hell, that's all upside

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no, very good point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, another thing played out in this space, a little out of order of our competition, but there's this acronym.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">People are starting to use MCP that is a way for you to represent your service, like if you were booking.com to a model so that it's not simply scraping your website, which is certainly not the ideal way to do this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that standard, I believe, got started in Anthropic, but OpenAI has agreed to support it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so another factor that plays out with whoever's most aggressive with the open standards is they might be able to take a lead in defining these things, which could be advantageous to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I got to tell you, you know, I meant to say this earlier when we were talking about the open source stuff, but I got to believe the anxiety is high at Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I got to believe the anxiety is high at Meta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">We've seen some high executive shifts and departures, also at Apple, in terms of who's in charge of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I see those moves, and I think that must represent anxiety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's a lot at stake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it'll be really interesting to see how open people are, how willing they are to be open with their models, how aggressive they are, because I think it's a really critical window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3098" target="_blank">00:51:38.700</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the tectonic plates, as I've said, as we've said for now two years, this is the first time they've shifted in this magnitude in 20 years, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3116"

target="_blank">00:51:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">For 20 years, the search paradigm ruled everything in consumer internet, and Google stood at the top of that mountain, and it took something, you know, it took an AI-level shift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.800</a></span> | <span

I think that's your point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3145" target="_blank">00:52:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we

target="_blank">00:52:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It broke the offering price, went down to about $37 a share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think today they had some announcements of this deal with Google where they're

business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned depreciation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3430" target="_blank">00:57:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The one thing I'd tell you about the depreciation argument as it relates to this company is, you know, a lot of people push on, you know, there's a statement by Jensen at GTC that, you know, hoppers may not have value because Grace Blackwell is so much better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">He was a little more aggressive than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">He called himself the chief revenue destroyer and basically made statements that I think if you interpreted or interpreted accurately would imply that maybe you should have a two-year depreciation, not a six.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, he made it sound that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3470" target="_blank">00:57:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very abrupt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And he took a lot of heat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3472" target="_blank">00:57:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He probably wishes he hadn't said it, but he said it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3474" target="_blank">00:57:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">My view on this is like, listen, because we've got to square this circle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We have, you know, the Saks tweet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we know the inference demand is off the charts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3483" target="_blank">00:58:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody has, you know, is demonstrating their need for more GPUs to run inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything in the world is becoming, you know, inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about that at length.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my view is this, you know, like when you talk about two years for GPUs, they're going to, cutting-edge GPUs are going to be used for cutting-edge training for the, you know, frontier models in that first two-year period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3504" target="_blank">00:58:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But all these things are going to continue to get used for inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3507" target="_blank">00:58:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the right way to think about CoreWeave, you know, and, you know, I think the consensus margins for this business are like 25% EBIT, you know, over the course of the next couple of years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">How do they get there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so think about their unit economics bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, their CapEx, their OPEX.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So they got to get a data center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They got to pay for all their operating expenses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they got to buy the servers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3530" target="_blank">00:58:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way this works, I think, is they sell a four-year deal to Microsoft or a four- or five-year deal to OpenAI or a four-year deal to Google or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">They expect to pay back all the CapEx, OPEX, and GPUs in three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3544" target="_blank">00:59:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the fourth year, which is a four-year guaranteed contract, the fourth year is your profit margin, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3550" target="_blank">00:59:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then anything you earn past the four years, that's all gravy on top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the consensus earnings are not giving them any credit for anything after the end of those contract periods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what I'll tell you is, you know, and we've done a lot of research on this, there's still a lot of A100s in use in the world today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, Jensen has talked at length about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a 2020 product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're in the fifth year, and A100s are still out there being used by almost everyone that bought A100s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and then if you look at it, I think Jensen at GTC said last year that OpenAI had just retired the V100s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a 2017 GPU.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3593" target="_blank">00:59:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's like a seven-year lifecycle that they were using those for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that we have a lot of comfort that at a minimum, people are going to be using these things for four years, a couple years for training, a couple years for inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3607" target="_blank">01:00:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I've yet to hear of anybody throwing away any GPU because it doesn't have value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember the way CUDA works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3613" target="_blank">01:00:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The software that runs these GPUs, it constantly gets upgraded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.760</a></span> | <span

had an old Tesla Model S, like seven years old, but it felt like a new car because my software got updated all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3627" target="_blank">01:00:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And frankly, it still got me to the places I needed to get to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't as good as the new model I bought in December with full FSD and everything else, but it didn't feel like a really old car because the software was constantly updating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of think of that the same way for these GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The GPUs are getting better every year, even though the hardware remains the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not nearly as worried about that depreciation schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems to be a big hit on the company and lots of people are talking about it, but they're out the door and kudos to them on this big new deal today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3660" target="_blank">01:01:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But look, the pushback on that is obviously that it's not a zero or a one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3666" target="_blank">01:01:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you make it sound like it's binary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You either throw it away or it's super valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And what inevitably happens is the earning power of that product drops over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3676"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And that TikTok U.S. will be partly owned by ByteDance.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So that we'll get our shares in ByteDance or in TikTok U.S.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4061" target="_blank">01:07:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4061" target="_blank">01:07:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">One particular question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4063" target="_blank">01:07:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If you go back six months, maybe three or six months, there was a lot of discussion that would suggest that the parent company, ByteDance, had no interest in this deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4074" target="_blank">01:07:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They'd rather shut it down than do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4076" target="_blank">01:07:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Have they changed their mind for some reason?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4079" target="_blank">01:07:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a new perspective from their side?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think, remember, if we go back six months, there was a camp that said, shut it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a camp saying, or we'll just take it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, I think that the company's perspective, Yaming, the founder of the company, he basically said, there's no way to separate the algorithm between TikTok U.S. and TikTok rest of world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Because creators in the U.S. create content that go to the rest of the world and vice versa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like, if you took away all the U.S., it does so much damage, you would be better to shut down TikTok U.S. and just invite the U.S. creators onto the French platform or the United Kingdom version of this or the Australian version of this via a VPN or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4128" target="_blank">01:08:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think the big change here, Bill, is this idea that U.S. TikTok and global TikTok will continue to use the same algorithm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4137" target="_blank">01:08:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just a license to the U.S. TikTok would be my guess, was part of that bridge or breakthrough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4142" target="_blank">01:09:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a key thing here is, like, how does Altimeter or Sequoia or other U.S. investors, remember, 60% of the investors in ByteDance are U.S. investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4156" target="_blank">01:09:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the investors in places like Altimeter, they're pension funds, they're teachers, they're firefighters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4161" target="_blank">01:09:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think about the fair value for ByteDance, I think most people, although it only trades at, let's call it, $300 billion, most people think the fair value of this is closer to a trillion dollars or certainly to $800 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you take 60% of a trillion dollars, that's $600 billion in locked up venture capital value for all of the endowments and pension funds, et cetera, for U.S. investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4189" target="_blank">01:09:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">That's more than almost every other unrealized venture gain put together, Bill, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4195" target="_blank">01:09:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, if you're able to take this company public, that turns into DPI, like hundreds of billions of dollars of DPI that goes out to the investors in these venture funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4207" target="_blank">01:10:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this company being TikTok or ByteDance?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4210" target="_blank">01:10:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">This company being ByteDance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4212" target="_blank">01:10:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But we had to get the TikTok deal done as a condition required to get ByteDance public or ByteDance out the door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4220" target="_blank">01:10:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, remember, ByteDance, about 90% of ByteDance's business is not TikTok U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">90% of the value of the company is things like Doyan, which is the Chinese version of TikTok, and Daobao, which is the Chinese version of ChatGPT, and TikTok around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4239" target="_blank">01:10:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, there's a huge and profitable business inside of China and in the rest of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4244" target="_blank">01:10:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're just debating this piece in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4247" target="_blank">01:10:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, as a shareholder, I will tell you that whatever the dilution is caused by this, it's nominal relative to the value of the total.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4257" target="_blank">01:10:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I really want to see get done is just certainty, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4260" target="_blank">01:11:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainty for the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's good for the U.S. that TikTok will remain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4265" target="_blank">01:11:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My kids love it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4265" target="_blank">01:11:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't, you know, I'm glad we're going to make them abide by the rules of regulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4270" target="_blank">01:11:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a win, you know, for Team Trump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4275" target="_blank">01:11:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a win for ByteDance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4276" target="_blank">01:11:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But remember now, we just hit them today, Bill, with 54% tariffs, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4281" target="_blank">01:11:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there may be a conversation that has to occur before she and Trump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought this deal would get approved by China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4288" target="_blank">01:11:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm not so sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4289" target="_blank">01:11:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4290" target="_blank">01:11:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Chinese government could probably block the deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4293" target="_blank">01:11:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4294" target="_blank">01:11:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just because we announce a deal, if we do hear a deal announced over the course of the next few days or over the next week, doesn't mean that it's a done deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4302" target="_blank">01:11:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll leave on an optimistic note.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4305" target="_blank">01:11:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that the president wants to do a deal with Xi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4309" target="_blank">01:11:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't believe we're going to have 54% tariffs against China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4314" target="_blank">01:11:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's too important to the rest of the world that we can cooperate with China on things like ending the war in the Ukraine, things in the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4325" target="_blank">01:12:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, there is a great competitive struggle between the two countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4332" target="_blank">01:12:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that ultimately, the president will cut a deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4336" target="_blank">01:12:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He said that he likes Xi, invited him to the inauguration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4339" target="_blank">01:12:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we know, he's a dealmaker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4341" target="_blank">01:12:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we've got everything from the Panama Canal to negotiate over, to TikTok, to all the other trade deals between the two countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4350" target="_blank">01:12:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I suspect that when we get back to what really came out of Liberation Day and what really matters, I think the most important thing that matters is U.S.-China bilateral trade relations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4362" target="_blank">01:12:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's going to really dictate the direction of global growth and the direction of U.S. and China economic growth over the course of the next few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DO0tP06eQ&t=4372"
