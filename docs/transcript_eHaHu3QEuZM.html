O Yahweh my God, I cried to you for help and you healed me. O Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol. You have kept me alive that I would not go down to the pit.</p><p>Sing praise to Yahweh, you his holy ones, and give thanks for the remembrance of his holy name, for his anger is but for a moment, his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may last for the night, but a shout of joy comes in the morning. As for me, I said in my prosperity, I will never be shaken.</p><p>O Yahweh, by your favor you have made my mountain to stand strong. You hid your face, I was dismayed. To you, O Yahweh, I called, and to the Lord I made supplication. What profit is there in my blood if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you?</p><p>Will it declare your truth? Hear, O Yahweh, and be gracious to me. O Yahweh, be my helper. You have turned for me my mourning into dancing. You have loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness that my glory may sing praise to you and not be silent. O Yahweh, my God, I will give thanks to you forever.</p><p>------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></div></div></body></html>
