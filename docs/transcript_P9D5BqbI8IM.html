My voice rises to God, and I must cry aloud. My voice rises to God, and He will hear me. In the day of my distress, I sought the Lord. In the night my hand was stretched out without weariness. My soul refused to be comforted.</p><p>I remember God, and I am disturbed. I muse, and my spirit faints. You have held my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I cannot speak. I give thought to the days of old, the years of long ago. I remember my music in the night. I am musing with my heart, and my spirit is searching.</p><p>Will the Lord reject evermore? And will He not be favorable again? Has His loving kindness ceased forever? Has His word ended from generation to generation? Has God forgotten to be gracious? Or has He in anger shut up His compassion? Then I said, "It is my grief that the right hand of the Most High has changed.</p><p>I shall remember the deeds of YAH. Surely I will remember your wonders of old. I will meditate on all your work and muse on your deeds. O God, your way is holy. What God is great like God. You are the God who works wonders. You have made known your strength among the peoples.</p><p>You have by your arm redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you. They were in anguish. The deeps also trembled. The clouds poured out water. The skies gave forth a sound. Your arrows went here and there. The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind.</p><p>The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook. Your way was in the sea and your paths in the mighty waters, but your footprints were not known. You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. Amen. Amen. Amen.</p></div></div></body></html>
