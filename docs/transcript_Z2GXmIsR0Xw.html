I know a lot of people who say, well, I want to go to Europe and I want to go this week. And in fact, I really want to go to Paris.</p><p>And I say, well, the one piece of flexibility it sounds like maybe you could have is when you book the trip. Because if you wait till the last minute, you might get a really amazing deal. Or if you can plan it over a year in advance, you might get the best deal.</p><p>So deciding when you're going to be able to book that trip is another form of flexibility because the average traveler is looking to book a trip somewhere around, I think, three to four months out. So if you can deviate from that and book it a year out, or if you're comfortable waiting until two weeks out, things open up so drastically in that last two week window that I would argue that that's kind of the best time to buy.</p></div></div></body></html>
