If you look at the one for the published app, I think it's mostly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah.

That's ridiculous. >> We will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have to have a leaderboard per word. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. So, anyway, this is the app as it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is. >> It's really great. It's like, it's got, you know, the spectate, the leaderboard. These</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">little touches are nice. And then the kinds of things which, well, I'd be interested to hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what you thought. But I think, like, yeah, the kinds of small additions that with most things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they're not actually small additions. But hopefully with fast HTML, it wasn't too hard to add.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Mm. Sorry, I'm getting distracted trying to draw a zoo. I just want to draw a zoo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah. And does it eventually time out? I see time left. Yes, it does. >> Yeah, yeah. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I've got 30 seconds left. >> Is it, like, illegal to actually write zoo on it? >> No. I saw some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">people on the public leaderboard using that trick. Oh, okay. Definitely some glitches that I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">introduced in my tinkering around for the demo. >> Anyhow. >> Yeah. The zoo one showing up there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, yeah. In the last half hour, I've introduced some bugs. But we can look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">-- the deployed one I'll try and have working by the time anyone sees this. And we can just go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">through the code for those different pieces of functionality bit by bit. And I'll, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of gradually reveal the complexity. Okay. So, this is the code. It's mostly in main.py.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll look at later. There's a little bit of styling and a little bit of JavaScript for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">canvas itself. >> I see. And you've picked a word list. >> Yeah. >> Did that come from somewhere?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I have a dump of words. I looked online at several different places for the, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">common dictionary words. There's also a lot of them are -- I kind of trimmed down many lists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because you can have things that are easy enough to judge close enough for a human. But I kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just have this, like, string matching, basically. And so, I removed anything too crazy conceptual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or with too many variants. >> Yeah. And presumably, the word list is not part of the prompt. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the model doesn't know that thing. And also, it's important for people to remember that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">none of these online services are learning from the interactions. So, they're never going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">learn this word list. >> Right. Exactly. I mean, I'm kind of thinking this might be a fun</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">eval for later. In which case, having, like, a known word list might make it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting, like, easier or cheaty. And then also, we definitely need to do some, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">something I haven't added yet. Keep track per session of what words you've seen so you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">see the same one again if the word list is too small. And if you've seen all of them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you should probably, like, be told to stop playing the game and go find something else to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your time. But, yeah. So, that's our list of words. Let's see. We've got different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">clients, API clients for the different models. The database, we're going to keep track of games,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">keep track of the images that are submitted, and keep track of the guesses that the models make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, setting those up with the Fastlight database there. >> Do you have any idea, like, about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">how expensive it is for us to run one game or how many tokens it takes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I could work backwards. Okay. So, I left it running for about 10 hours,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">constantly guessing two games simultaneously, which is what I've set as the max.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that used about 5 million tokens, which was, I think, $1.25 on Haiku,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe even less than $1 for Gemini Flash. And that's, I'd have to do the math, like, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">10 hours, 30 seconds a game, and actually two games every 30 seconds. So, it's not free,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's also, like, not crazy expensive if there's a limit on the total number of games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah, very inexpensive. >> And so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But that would be a worry if you wanted, you know, like, if you wanted this to be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Word War or something, where there's hundreds of thousands of people playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">simultaneously in the morning with a cup of coffee. >> Well, I liked your trick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you did with your earlier captioning game, where we just have a balance, where if there's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">money in the balance, people can just donate $5 to play themselves, and everybody else can play too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah. Yeah, we can see how that goes. At the moment, to keep the spend in check,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and to keep it tempered, there is a queue. So, if there's more than two people playing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then other people will be put into the queue rather than starting a game immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Nice. >> And so, we can look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at the logic for that. That was one of the, like, yeah, like, oh, it's somewhat non-trivial over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">base case where everyone always sees the canvas.

There's a unique session</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ID that lets us do things per player and keep track of who's who. >> Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">>> We're loading in some JavaScript, some styling. >> So, that session is kind of like a user,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's attached to a browser, basically. There's no way to have the same jono across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple browsers.

They'll have the same session. >> Yeah. And so, if you wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have, you know, leaderboards and high scores and avoid abuse, it might be better to have, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a login with Google and create a proper user account. >> Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">>> But for now, this is nice. You can just load the page and start playing. You don't even have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to put in a name until after the game. Not at all. Okay. So, we have a game manager class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I should say a lot of this code was written by Sonic 3.5. It's not necessarily the style I do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but it picked up the fast HTML surprisingly fast. Like, giving it the starting point that I had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as a file, that was pretty good. >> Did you use our fast HTML</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">board project with all the stuff in there? Okay. Because that also helps quite a bit. I just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a project with all the big kind of highly commented demo app loaded into the context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which it's really good at writing fast HTML with that. >> Right. Yeah. By the time I started this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I already had an existing app that showed a lot of the functionality. And it was just like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that does this. Could you add a thing that does, you know, so it like had the pieces already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I think the reason it's so good at this is because it's kind of like basically a style</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">transfer problem. Like, it literally is HTML, just written a different way. So, it's kind of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all of its embeddings are still going to work, except for that last layer or two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">where it has to use slightly different tokens. >> Yeah. And a lot of the routing, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is quite familiar from like fast API and things like that. >> Yes, exactly. And Flask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">>> All right. So, we have a way to keep track of active games, to start and end games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At the end of a game, I make a GIF. Totally unnecessary, but kind of nice for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">previews. >> I really like those.

And so, then the way I've organized this is to have the main, like, roots. So, the home,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the about page, the leaderboard, and the spectate page. And then all the supporting bits of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">infrastructure for that afterwards. I know you don't like the, like, out of order pieces, but...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Sorry, the out of order pieces? >> Oh, to have the home and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">something that the home depends on, like, a bunch, far later in the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">>> It doesn't, though, does it?

So, home is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">use navbar, but because it's all executable... >> There's no reason for me not to like it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Jono. It's just, like, you know, when I used to write C and stuff, you had to. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">now I'm like, that ought to work.

So, the main page, got a title, got a navbar. This, again, thank you, Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Links to the different pages.

And it also has a link that'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">take you to Twitter and say, hey, I scored this in this game. And this is the URL. And it's got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a little preview image.

And I saw,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">interestingly, on the about page, you were using markdown. Are you using JavaScript to convert that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or... >> Yes.

Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this will take us there. >> And this is just a little convenience for you.

Yeah. I just wanted to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">able to, like, come and write this without having to think about that.

Yeah, just makes life a little easier. Okay, so maybe we should look at, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the actual, like, the core game loop. You know, a lot of the other pieces are quite atomic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like the leaderboard, but the game active area... >> Well, just show the leaderboard. So how is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that... is that being stored in a SQLite database? Is that how that works? >> Right. So this is doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a query on the database. Like, oh, get many finished games with an end time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">order by the time taken. It should probably have made that its own column so that it's not doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">those calculations. And it's doing this every time someone goes to the page. But I have the feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that, like, you know, operations like this, like taking a database of a few hundred games and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sorting it for every unique visitor is kind of dwarfed by the, like, waiting for big AI models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to finish and, like, serving out these GIFs and all of that jazz. You know, like, that's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">more computation. Also, even, like, I shared this a little bit this morning, and there's quite a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">people playing. The CPU usage on the machine that it's deployed on is, like, it just... the graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't even read, like, 0.0. You know, 0.0 something. >> Is this running on a little VPS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or something? >> It's on railway. So just the... >> Oh, railway. Cool. Okay. >> Yeah. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">really not... it doesn't seem to be... I mean, obviously, if it goes viral, we'll see how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">handles that. But yeah, just at the moment, tricks like this gets it nice and fast. Query the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">database, make a table. So I'm giving a row in the table for each game. Little title, heading, link.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So I don't think there's any HTMX here. It's just, again, rendering a page based on some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">data. We could do a thing to see if any of the games had the player ID that's the same as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">person viewing the page to, like, flag your own games or something like that. But you can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just look for your nickname or something. >> Or you could also do that thing that you often see in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">games where, like, it'll show you the top 10, and then it'll be, like, dot, dot, dot, and then it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">show you the five above and below yours, your best. >> Right, right. So place 112 as me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">my best game or something like that. Or my most recent game. Yeah. Cool. Okay. So the actual game,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it comes into this area here. And so all the action is in this active area part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then in the handling of the images. >> I just like -- I'm still thinking -- sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't stop thinking about your -- it's so delightfully HTMX-y, this idea that, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have any fancy JavaScript to check, you know, change the class dynamically if blah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">blah, blah. Like, it's just -- you know, it's static HTML generated from a function. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really great. >> Yeah. Yeah. And it's -- it's -- you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, I really like it. And it also is, like, okay, I'm sending a little bit of redundancy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? I'm sending that on all three pages people visit. Like, what is that? 812 wasted bytes when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm also loading a bunch of GIFs? >> Exactly. So I'm just thinking -- so already -- I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that function you just showed us, you could change title -- yeah, you could change title</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to title, right? No, the one -- the top -- the up, up, up, up. >> This one here? >> Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that one. Rhymes164. Title could become titled. Then you wouldn't need main. You wouldn't need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">class container. But then you could write your own thing like titled that actually calls titled,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which also adds the navbar, you know what I mean? So you can, like -- so titled already factors out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the -- you know, the -- oh, actually, you don't have an h1, which is different. So, yeah. Anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so that's kind of, like, the fast HTML idiomatic approach, I think, is to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not have templates, but more you just have functions to refactor out the commonly used UI elements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. Let's see. So I've gone to the home page, and there's -- I'm looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">at that area there. And so if I haven't started any games, I'm a refresh user, this is what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to see. I'm going to see a button that says play a game. That's going to post to join,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's going to update this active area that's, like, the sort of main play area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Nice. >> So I guess we can look at join.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Join is going to add them to the queue if there's a queue. Otherwise, it's going to start a game,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it's going to return that same active area. But now, whereas before they were a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">user, now there's a game on or they're in the queue, and so there's different pieces for them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to see, depending on that. If they're in the queue, we've got a little countdown saying, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">all the games are full.

And maybe, okay, I needed to add an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">extra column in one of the databases because I wanted to show something about that. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you do, like, touch other pieces of the system, but it feels like a lot of these are, like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we add this piece, then we add this piece, then we add this piece. >> Yeah, and then line 267 there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is just, like, oh, here's a canvas. Okay. >> Yeah. >> So there must be some JavaScript</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere, I assume. I did see you had a JavaScript earlier. >> Yeah, yeah. So if you're in an active</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">game, we are now, like, displaying a canvas, and there's actually two bits of JavaScript going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a countdown, and there's a canvas. So we can look at the JavaScript for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's almost none of it written by me. When we first load this or any element, we find anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that matches this selector, and then we add some event listeners to it and color the background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">white. We have some drawing code that you'll find in lots and lots of tutorials if you're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for, like, how to draw on an HTML5 canvas. Again, very easy for someone like Claude to write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">>> It's kind of nice that you actually -- I like the way you haven't attempted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">use HTMX or any of this. You're just, like, here, this is our JavaScript bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'll just use JavaScript. >> Yeah. Yeah. So the one place that I used to have HTMX -- okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so we're drawing some lines, and once we're done drawing, we're going to send the canvas data to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the server. And so that's this piece here. It's getting the canvas, it's turning it into a blob</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of data, and then it's posting it to a root, and we can intercept that. So you can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">use HX trigger to, like, from JavaScript, trigger an HTMX event. But yeah, this is, like, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I found the easy way of doing it. Just whenever I want from within my JavaScript,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm posting this data. I do have some throttling so that it's not like someone's drawing a million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">dots. It's not sending million images. It's sending one every -- >> Yeah, I mean, I bet we could,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it might be fun, actually, even to look at refactoring that to make it smaller. But,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like, yeah, when you're just building something, and if Claude says, "Here's the code," then just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">use the code. >> Right. I pasted my previous one in. I said, "This sends a lot of events. If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">someone's doing lots of dots, could you add throttling?" So it's all this, like, iterative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Oh, okay, we change sendCanvas to throttled sendCanvas data, and we add a new function."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of having this be in here. Yeah, okay, so that's the main, like, Canvas piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see, there was a countdown as well. Yeah, it's just a little bit extra to have the, like --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Nice. >> Here's the countdown flashing there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and the reason it's here is because you can also do all sorts of other things easier in JavaScript</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on the web page if you wanted to have big lines counting down, and flashes, and all that sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. So in that JavaScript, we saw that it's sending the images to a different root, and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's maybe then the next piece where a lot of important stuff is happening. We're getting an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">image. So first, okay, does this person have any right to be sending us images? Is it from a person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">who's in an ongoing game? If so, go look up the game, and then --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Just a reminder that sessions are signed, so somebody can't take that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Right, yeah. So you can't put a new SID in your session. I mean, not that it would make too much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of a difference here, but yeah. For something more secure, you could potentially store, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a username or a unique key to look up in your database. Yeah, so we're getting an image. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">writing it to a file. But importantly, we're not, like, querying those AI models, right? So this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">runs pretty fast, and it's just returning back some -- actually, I could return back nothing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm returning some stuff to the JavaScript so that it knows, okay, the game is still ongoing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And -- >> And, like, if you wanted to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you could make this more performant by adding the word async before def on line 421,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and image.file.read. You could use await there with, you know, async I/O,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, stuff like that. So, like, there's -- and def.write, you know, so there's a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">places you could definitely -- well, you'd have to use the -- yeah, I guess the async I/O version of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I/O read, but -- yeah. >> Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Might take five minutes. >> Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Or if you're familiar with async, 20 seconds. >> I am not very familiar with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I'm not very familiar with it either.

We're not sending anything back. We could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sending back a piece of HTML to say, like, we received your latest guess or something like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or give some other sort of status update there. Okay. So, what's happening to those images?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They're getting saved. They're getting stored in the games table. We're keeping track of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, the active games and the game manager thing. So, now the design of this is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm responding to the request straight away, but then in the background, like, kind of constantly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I've got some separate threads running that are, like, looking if there's any new images that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">come in. If so, they're sending them off to the different AI models. When they get guesses back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they're, like, responding with those guesses. So, all of that is happening kind of separate to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm responding to requests part of the app. It's in a different thread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the part that's, like, very much ad hoc messy. I got Sonnet to rewrite it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't like how it rewrote it. So, it's a little bit, like, hodgepodge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But with that caveat, we can see what it's doing. Each of these functions is what you'd see in the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like, vision tutorial of the docs for the different APIs. We have a prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the picturing prompt. >> I definitely want to rewrite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">with this with Claudette. >> Yeah.

You don't have any chat history. So, you'd only be using the Claudette,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, utility functions. >> Yeah. It's not a big deal. Just a nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">little thing, like, all the image handling and everything would be done for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah.

Okay. So, these functions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just take an image and an optional history of past guesses. They send the image to the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and they get back the response. >> And do they all get the same prompt?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yes.

It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, no, no. You already tried that. It didn't work."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Exactly. >> Yeah. So, that gets some variety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Nice. >> I'm saving the images and, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the image sequences. I kind of want to, like... Separately to this project, you will have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">data set, and we can try the different, like... Prompt them with the whole image sequence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt them with guess history versus not, you know, like, experiment with that as, like, a task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">At the moment, yeah. As you can see, just a simple prompt, and hope for the best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, also, like, all of these should be doing things like, you know, checking for rate limiting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I do have a little bit in this one. The others really do need, like, error catching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I noticed once we released it publicly, Jem and I were suddenly having, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously disapproved of some of the image content, the safety moderation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Of course. >> You didn't get any text back in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a response. You instead get some different thing. >> That's another thing you'll get for free with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff like Claudette, kind of an exponential back off type thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Right. Yeah. So, exponential back off, catching different errors, maybe, like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">banning a session if the person's drawings are regularly triggering a safety filter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, some sort of, like, maybe separate prompt that's just a moderation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt. Is this something that we want on the general, you know, spectate feed or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So, that's definitely lots of room for improvement there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what's happening is these different functions are being called in this background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">task. And so, we're keeping track of, like, what games are running. There's, like, we don't want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">repeatedly, like, guess too fast. We also don't want to wait too long. So, we've got a timeout</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and, like, a minimum time. And then at some point, we're, like, running these tasks with an image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">>> And presumably a lot of this is LLM written? >> Yeah. Pretty much all of this is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah, you could. >> Yeah. So, I think this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the part that I feel like I'm sure I can rewrite this much neater.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">>> But, I mean, you know, it's fine. Like, if it's a, you know, pretty well-defined blocker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">functionality that an LLM can write, then that's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah. Yeah. I think it could do with some thinking about, like, handling the errors better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">logging, and maybe also, like, the way it's updating the database. At the moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the Fastlight has the SQL set to, like, only allow access from a single thread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, there's some, like, kludgy hacks around that that I did. Whereas, I think that's, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a flag we can toggle. >> Okay. Also, I wrote this little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Redis-based kind of Neo clone of Fastlight on the weekend, which I'm using for Vercel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which is another option. >> Yeah. And it might be nice to put this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, like, I think the way people build these apps often is, rather than having a volume,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and, like, I'm storing the images to disk here. Instead, you'd have, like, blob storage for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">image files, and you'd have, yeah, like, Redis or some other KB cache for your database that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2025" target="_blank">00:33:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">could, you know, have separate dashboards for it elsewhere and, you know, like, edit it and tweak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it and export it. >> But that's hard to be set for, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the simplicity of, like, SQL in a file system, you know? They're things we're pretty familiar with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2042" target="_blank">00:34:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're not specific to the service either. >> Yeah. And it's quite nice, like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you just zip up that data folder, and you've got your data export, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah. >> Yeah.

I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that's pretty much it. >> Thanks, John.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMZo9PTmHk&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">>> There's another thread.
