You won't even entertain it. You won't even go for it. And so part of the goal of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a 10x philosophy is to actually pursue things that are impossible so that your brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">can start actually trying to solve it. The basic problem here is that most people just don't imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">their future selves. They don't take time to think about it, let alone a 10x future self, right? The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">truth is your future self is going to be totally different than who you are right now. 3, 5, 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">years from now, you're not going to be the same person. So like when it comes to your future self,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">be specific, highly specific, and it can't be specific in 50 ways, maybe specific in three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Ben, thank you for being here. Really happy to be with you, Chris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">When I first heard 10x, I immediately thought, okay, this sounds like a lot more work. You say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">10x is easier than 2x. Help people understand how that's actually possible. All right. Awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first off, super happy to be with you. Yeah. So let's talk about the difference between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what a 2x psychology is versus a 10x psychology. I'm going to give you a little bit of kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">let's call it some foundational psychology. I'm going to keep it really simple, but I just want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to help people understand the foundation before we build the house. So in psychology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's really important to understand how people are operating. So what the basis of the research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">shows is that most people, they look at time like they think about time on a clock. So as an example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">if I think about my past, the past is behind me. My present is now, and the future is up ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's kind of how we view time is that we can't go back to the past. We're in the present,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can't really get to the future, but we're aiming towards something. We can think about our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">future and we can set goals and kind of use our future self as an example to kind of map where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going in the present. That's kind of how people view time. And that's what would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">considered a linear view of time. The problem is that that's not how it works psychologically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's the basis of a 2x mindset. A 2x mindset means that you're taking the past and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the present, and you're using that foundation to build the future. And so it's very linear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically what it means is that to go 2x, you're usually just doing more of what you already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">have. You're just doing more and more of who you already are. I just want to give a little bit more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">core psychology, and then we'll just... Honestly, we go wherever you want. But the profound thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">about psychology is that in psychology, time doesn't work that way. In psychology, it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the past that determines the present. It's actually the present that determines the meaning of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">past. And this is like a fundamental mindset when it comes to healing trauma, things like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is that my past isn't what's determining who I am now. Actually, it's who I am now that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">determines the meaning of my past. And the more you get really good at that, the more you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">continuously transform your past in ways that it is happening for you rather than happening to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you listen to most people's language, they still blame their past for why they are the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they are right now, rather than taking ownership that it's actually you right now that are shaping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the story, the narrative, the frame, the view of your past. And so that's just one fundamental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">component is that it's not the past that determines the present. It's the present that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">determines the past. Well, the same thing is true about the future. So again, a 2x mindset means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm going to take the present and I'm going to use that to shape my future. Well, a 10x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">mindset is the opposite. A 10x mindset starts with the future. And it even scales it so high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that it feels impossible, literally impossible. So I know that you asked the question, how are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">saying that this is easier? Now I'm actually say it's literally impossible. But you take the future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and you scale it to such a high view that it feels impossible. And then rather than letting the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">present shape the future, you're now actually letting the future shape the present. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">letting the future determine who you are and what you do in the present. In other words, I'm letting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">my future self determine who I am in the present. I'm not letting my present self determine who my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">future self will be. And so these are very different approaches to time. I was just telling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you straight up, psychologically, the past and the present are just tools. They're just tools for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">allowing me to operate in the present. If I have a bad relationship with my past, then I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">be stuck there. And I may have some trauma that happened when I was five years old, and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">letting that past dictate me in the present. Although that's the common way, and what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">teaching is very advanced psychology. The core phrase right here is called psychological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility. I'm giving you these foundations. We're going to go into 10X versus 2X, but I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">want the listeners and even yourself to have some of these foundations. The super skill in psychology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is called psychological flexibility. The more flexible I am psychologically, the more I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">reshape the meaning of my past. I can let it go. I can recognize that I'm not even my past self.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not your past self. The listener is not their past self. I'm not the same person I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">five years ago. I'm not even the same person I was five weeks ago. And the better I get at my past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the more I can recognize and appreciate, "Oh yeah, here are the ways I'm different. Here's how I see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things differently." The same skill, psychological flexibility, is used to imagine a different future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and then to let that future dictate who I am in the present. Can you give an example of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">someone might apply that to some event in the past? Oh yeah. I'll go big and I'll go small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The first place that people usually go is something big. I got divorced or I lost a job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or my parents got divorced. So me as an example, my parents got divorced when I was 11 years old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">My father then proceeded to become a drug addict. And so my father was a drug addict all through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">high school. Now, of course that could impact my life, but it's up to me right now to shape the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning of that. So I can either consider my father a villain or a hero, right? And neither</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of those stories are actually true. They're just a framing. They're a view. They're a story. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of a story is that it's just a perspective. But we as people, our identity is shaped by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">story we tell. And so one angle is just reframing the whole story and looking at what does this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">story mean? And it's me in the present that determines the meaning of the story. Even if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you really dig into the research on memory, memory is never a retrieval. Often we think about memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">as I'm going to go into the file cabinets of my brain and I'm going to grab this memory. I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to pull it out and I'm going to look at it. That's not how memory is. Memory is what they call a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">reconstruction. I'm always reconstructing my memory from the present. And so even now, as I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about my dad, I'm going to be rebuilding that memory just like I can be rebuilding some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of my future in my head. I'm rebuilding it as I go. And so they say that your past is a living</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">part of who you are in the present, and you're the one who creates it. But there's one other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">really important part. So there's the whole framing of it, the big picture of the story,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's also the filtering of it. That's the focus. So as an example, if I'm looking back on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the last five months, as I gave an example, or the last even five weeks, I can look for the ways in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which I've been a loser, right? I can look for all the ways in which I've failed over the last five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks. And that's me filtering for and searching for certain things. And that's often what people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">do is they'll look for the ways in which things are going wrong. And instead, you can proactively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">look for the ways that things are going right. I can look for the ways in which I've made progress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and I've learned things that my past self didn't know. It's just ultimately up to your control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll give a smaller example. So as an example, and we actually do this. We actually do this all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the time. Our brains are always reshaping the meaning of the past constantly. But I just want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the listener to know, and even you know, and hopefully you can ask me questions. I hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we can make it practical. I just want you to understand that in the present, you're the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">shaping the past. And hopefully we can get to the point where we're talking about how it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the future that determines the present. But on a small scale, like, let me give an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So like I have, we have six kids, we actually have literally a seventh one living with us right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's crazy. So we adopted three kids from the foster system. We also have three of our own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But right now, you're just talking to me at an odd time. So like I, we literally have a seventh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, 15 year olds from Guatemala living with us, who's, it may be permanent, it may not be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll give you a small example of how the present can determine the meaning of the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Me as a father of six, I'm 35 years old, I fall flat on my face 24/7. I don't even know what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doing. I'm learning on the fly. And as a result, you know, my 15 year old son, we adopted him when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">he was 10. I often do stupid stuff, like overreact and get mad at him and stuff like that for stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that really doesn't matter. And so like I could, you know, like, maybe a day or two ago, I, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">know, I, I did something where it's kind of like a, you know, a flubbed father thing. But the cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">part is, is that I know that in the present, I can turn that into something that happened for me and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for him, and that I'm not the byproduct of what happened. So I can go back really simply and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">apologize, right? And say, "Look, Caleb, super sorry that that happened. Here's where I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">coming from. I see that I was handling that wrong." Boom. The meaning of that conversation has now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">changed. And so just, it's just really empowering to know that it does not really matter what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. It matters what you do about it in the present, and that you can always flip whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">happened into something that's useful rather than something that is kind of utilizing you. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">how I see it is you can either be used by the past or you can use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take an example of someone who's looking for a job right now and kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">interviewed three times and it was a disaster. The idea is, you know, to stop thinking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay, I did this three times incorrectly." And more think, "Okay, maybe here are the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that I did wrong. Now I know them. And now in my future self, I'm not going to do them anymore. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually even better because of it." Would that be a way to apply?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So like, events have no meaning in and of themselves. So those three things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">those three failed job applications, they don't have to be considered negatives. That is meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that is placed upon it by the person. And now they're making it personal. And now they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">literally equating it to their self-worth. "Oh, I must be..." And so all of that stuff is psychology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">being placed on those three things. I don't place my psychology on those three things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If I heard about your friend who failed three job applications, do you think I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">personalize that towards myself? And I'm going to feel like a loser for that friend's...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not personalizing it. So one key thing is just not personalizing your own things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, for those three things, that person can flip those three things into something amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Clearly, they can learn from it. What were all the things that they learned from one, two, and three?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">How did they actually get better from one, two, and three? So this is now just analyzing the past</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in different ways. What was different about one, two, and three? Now, based on where they're at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now, what do they now know that they wouldn't have known before? Maybe now they can go out and get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">totally different job because now they know certain things they would have never known before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just always knowing that in the present, you have power over your past, and that in the present,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you can take whatever happened in the past, even if it was something terrible, and you can flip it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">into something absolutely amazing. I think a really good phrase for that would be "anti-fragile."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Just no matter what happens, you're now better as a result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So that's reframing the past. Are there other kind of core fundamental things that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">need to be thinking about for a 10x mindset? No, no, no. I just want the orientation of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to be this way, that it's not the past. Most people, they're using time like they think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the outside time. They're thinking, "Okay, it's the past that determines the present,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's the present that determines the future." The more powerful approach is that it's always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the future that determines who I am in the present, which if you really think about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that makes a lot of sense. As an example, I wanted to get a PhD. So obviously, that goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">shaped me getting into PhD programs. I didn't go off and do something different. I followed my goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So it makes sense. But when you really get down to it, there's a lot of research that shows...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is Harvard research and stuff. There's a guy named Daniel Gilbert. He gave a TED Talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">called "The Psychology of Your Future Self." But the thing that's really interesting is this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it fits very much with a 2x mindset. So honestly, we're pretty much at the point where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we can drill into 10x versus 2x and get as strategic as you want. And usually, I honestly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">don't go this far, but I know you just said you like having deeper conversations. And so I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">happy to give that, honestly, some of the more fundamental psychology. But what happened with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Daniel Gilbert's research is this, and there's a lot of research on this at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">When most people think about their future self, what they do is they take who they are now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and they use that view of my current self, so the person you're talking to right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just use that as the basis for who I think I'll be in the future. Even in 5 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">10 years from now, I'm like, "Yeah, how could I see myself being someone different?

And the research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">shows that teenagers, they think that they're going to grow as much as people in their 60s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">70s, and 80s actually do.

But the basic problem here is that most people just don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">imagine their future selves.

Maybe give an example. Because I think some people hear like, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">imagine your future self." And they immediately jump to, "Okay, I've got this job. I've got this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hat." And those aren't the self part. That's the future part. What's the difference there? Maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">through an example. That's a really cool question. Obviously, when you're thinking about your future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">self, probably inherent in that is your future. What is my future self doing? What's their life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like? What are they up to? Let me give an example. When I was a PhD student, my future self was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">someone who... And I did not have these skills or capabilities or anything at that point. But my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">future self was someone who was a professional author. I had never had a blog or anything like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that. But I wanted to be making high six figures to provide for my family. That was the future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">self I was assuming back when I was a first year graduate student. I want to be a professional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">author. I want to be able to write books for a living and provide for my family. And that version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of my future self could do things that the current version of me could not, such as think in certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ways, teach in certain ways, write... I was honestly just writing really good books. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">had none of those capabilities at that point when I was thinking about it. But that was who I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to be. That was what I wanted my life to look like. And from where I was sitting, that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">seemingly impossible. The odds of, for example, getting a six-figure book deal, that's 1% of 1%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think one thing that's really important here is that that might seem impossible if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">judging that future based on your current situation, or worse yet, if you're judging it on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">your past. The cool part about using the future to determine the present is that now you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have to deal with typical odds or things like that.

You're letting the future, whatever you want that to be, be the driver of what you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">here and now. That's the driver of the decisions you make. It's the driver of the friends you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the driver of the choices you make. And so now the present really isn't the determining factor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The future is the determining factor and how committed you are to that future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, one thing that brings to mind is looking back at examples in your past of times that things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">happened that you never would have thought were possible.

Usually, your brain is only solving what it's working on. And so if you actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">start going for an impossible goal, there's a really great quote from this by Dan Sullivan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Dan Sullivan was the co-author of this book.

If my attention is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">scattered on the 80% of things, and I'm at the surface of a thousand things, then my time is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be all over the place. I'm not going to get much use out of that time. And so the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">answer to the question is really about absolutely the 80% has nothing to do with your time or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">attention anymore.

As an example, yeah, there may be certain things that it's worth keeping, but absolutely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you have nothing to do with it anymore.

And there are deeper concepts here. Like one of the things I talk about is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">raising the floor, which is raising your minimum commitment and then beginning to say no to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">everything below that commitment. Like as an example, if I want to massively raise my floor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like the floor on what I say yes to-- and by the way, from a psychology standpoint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your floor as a person is your minimum standard. And as people, we all have standards, right? We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">all have a standard. But you can know your standard by what you say yes to, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if I sit and scroll on Facebook for four hours a day, then obviously that's a part of--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's within my standards because I say yes to it. If I then rose the standard really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really high and said, this is the new standard.

This is the minimum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">commitment, right? And your identity is what you're most committed to. Then I now have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">say no to things that I used to say yes to.

That then starts to be pretty intense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But let me give a personal example of something going on right now. This one's a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">more intense.

The 80% could be a habit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be a friend.

A lot of people-- I hate to even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">voice this one. But sometimes when I share this with people, some people are like, it's my husband,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

What are some examples you've seen of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">10X for future selves on the personal side?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

And you fail a thousand times to get there. From a bigger picture standpoint, going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from horse and buggy to a car, I consider that a 10X.

That's your future self. That's your ideals. But what happens to people, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">especially high achievers, is that they're always measuring themselves against that horizon. And as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a result, they now feel like they're actually not doing that great in the present. So it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2828" target="_blank">00:47:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">diminishes your present and largely diminishes your past because you're not where you could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or should be, or you're not as good as that person.

And so I just think it's really important to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">accurately measure your progress.

That's beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2851" target="_blank">00:47:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't forget that. Actually write that out. And so I'm always reminding myself, not just reminding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm actually documenting. This is part of creating the past and mastering the past is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">actually becoming aware of all the ways in which I've actually accomplished things even in the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">week. And I would forget about those things and even downplay them if I'm always only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2875" target="_blank">00:47:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">wishing I was at my future. Again, we're using the future as the filter and the decision making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">factor in the present, but we're not living in that future. We're bringing that future to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">present. But just on a really simple terms, on a weekly basis, look back and write down all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">wins. Write down all the ways in which you've made progress. You can even write down the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">went wrong that now you now know better, now the lessons. You could write down the ways in which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you're different from your past self. Do that on a monthly basis. Go back to the beginning of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">year. Go back three years to COVID. Write down all the things that you've actually accomplished,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2905" target="_blank">00:48:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the key experiences you've had. Write down the things that you now know that you probably didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">know back then. That's the whole idea of keeping proper perspective. And if you can do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">then playing the game of going for massive futures is awesome because I don't need that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">future.

And also I'm extremely blown away by even where I'm at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm always reminded of that. So I just think that that's a crucial first step is staying in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that what we call a gain mindset rather than a gap mindset. I think that that's an initial keynote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and if there's anything you want to say there. But I think that that's a fundamental foundation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of a healthy psychology. Okay. So I think that's really helpful because what I want to try to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2945" target="_blank">00:49:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">at is what are the things that people trying to push forward that create this 10x mindset,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of push their life forward to a place they want to be, where are they going to get stuck?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So it sounds like one place they'll get stuck is this. It's not necessarily framing everything in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the right way. And so not looking at their past in the right way and whatnot. So where else...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some other big spots.

Can I give you an example?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Where would you get stuck?

If you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about your next big leap, what's going to get you stuck?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a few. So one is prioritization. If you have... You envision this 10x version of yourself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there's probably more than one vector in which you're changing. So I'm not just changing what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I do professionally, or who I hang out with, or what I say no to. It's all of those things and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">more. So figuring out where to start and what to focus on first, I think is one. Figuring out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">next steps in really ambitious things probably is another big one because you don't know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">next step because it's not obvious. Those are a couple things that come to mind. On the spot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I love it. I mean, to me, I love it. And those are great spots. So one of them that I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is really helpful. So there's a classic book, "Good to Great" from Jim Collins. And one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">things that he talks about in that book is, and I'm using a business example, but I could also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">use this as a personal example. Very few companies go on to become excellent, great. Even very few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">companies go on to keep existing. Even really, really good companies that we think are good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">right now are not going to exist in five or 10 years. And what's the difference between the two?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what that whole book is about. And one of the main things is that... So good will stop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">existing. Just remember that. Good is going to stop existing. It's going to fail. Good will fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Only the great can even have a shot at succeeding, let alone continuing to exist. I'm just talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">business, but this also fits with life. So the companies that become great let go of everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that is merely good. And so they are hyper-focused. One of the things you even told me at the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of this conversation is you like having deep conversations, right?

When you're going to a new place, a lot of the friends that got you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">here, it's not like they're no longer your friends, but your relationship will change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't hang out with them every day.

And you can either learn to embrace that or you can let it be a really painful experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that one of the ways of embracing it is just to appreciate what it was. It's almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like what Marie Kondo literally talks about.

I think a lot of people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they overblow letting something go.

In psychology, we would say time is holistic rather than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4035" target="_blank">01:07:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sequential. Sequential would be that the past is behind this present. I'm saying it's holistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4039" target="_blank">01:07:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The past, present, and future are all happening right now. But it's really powerful to use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4043" target="_blank">01:07:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">future as a filter. When I say filter, it's a filtering thing. Yes, no. And so when you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4050" target="_blank">01:07:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a 10x future, the reason it's so powerful is that it is a powerful filter for what you say yes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4056" target="_blank">01:07:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">no to. And so it can be an orientation towards life, not just something you do. It's a filtering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4062" target="_blank">01:07:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">system. Me as an example, I've had a messy car for a while. And just this morning, I cleaned it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4069" target="_blank">01:07:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">out because I just said, that's not my future self. That's in the 80%. The stuff in my car,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4075" target="_blank">01:07:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the 80%.

No, one of the shirts I just threw it away. Not my future self. But it really just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4083" target="_blank">01:08:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">becomes an orientation. And it allows you to really do make big leaps. I'm saying this on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4091" target="_blank">01:08:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the personal side. First off, I invite anyone listening to think about the times you've done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4099" target="_blank">01:08:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this. Chances are, all of us have done this at different stages where you actually got committed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4103" target="_blank">01:08:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to something in the future. And over time, you went all in on that. Even if it was going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4106" target="_blank">01:08:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">college or whatever it may have been. And over time, you had to let go of aspects of what were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4112" target="_blank">01:08:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">big parts of your life back then. Me as an example. Me going in high school, a lot of big parts of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4117" target="_blank">01:08:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">life. Going to high school. It became part of my 80%. But even the friend group. Me, I was huge on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4122" target="_blank">01:08:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">snowboarding and playing video games. I played World of Warcraft 15 hours a day. Snowboard all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4128" target="_blank">01:08:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the time. And then I had the bigger future that invited me to let that stuff go. And so I had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4132" target="_blank">01:08:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">let go of the stuff that was important in that chapter in my life. And by had to, I said I chose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4136" target="_blank">01:08:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to. I could have held onto that. And like some of my friends, still been playing 15 years later</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4141" target="_blank">01:09:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">because they just couldn't let that go. And by the way, I think a really huge book on this topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4147" target="_blank">01:09:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you ever read Man's Search for Meaning?

Well, that's one of the most important. It's one of the most important books of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4156" target="_blank">01:09:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">last 150 years. It's written by a guy named Viktor Frankl. It's all about his experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4160" target="_blank">01:09:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in the concentration camps. This book was written in the '50s. So he was a Jewish psychiatrist who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4166" target="_blank">01:09:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">lived through the Holocaust. And his whole book is about the psychology of the Holocaust and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4172" target="_blank">01:09:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">happens when you get everything, literally everything taken from you. And now you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">watching your wife get killed. Your mom gets put in a gas chamber. You're sleeping on the floor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He literally just walks you through the psychology of all of it. And in that book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4186" target="_blank">01:09:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">he talks about the fundamental importance of having a future to hope for, to strive for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4191" target="_blank">01:09:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to live for. Because if you lose that future, then in the present, especially if you're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4196" target="_blank">01:09:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a horrible situation like a concentration camp, then there's really no purpose for anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4201" target="_blank">01:10:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he talks about how that's when people literally gave up the ghost. In those situations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4206" target="_blank">01:10:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they're already starving to death.

It's really... One of his quotes in that book is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4218" target="_blank">01:10:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, "What people need is not a tensionless state, but rather the striving and the struggling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4223" target="_blank">01:10:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task."

Actually, there's plenty of time for recovery. And all that stuff is part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4237" target="_blank">01:10:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">process. But to have a future that is stretching you and inviting you to make some big decisions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and to let go of stuff that no longer is who you are. I think it's really important to realize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4247" target="_blank">01:10:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're not your past self.

As an example, you're probably going to work, right? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4433" target="_blank">01:13:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if you weren't thinking about your future self two weeks from now, paying the bills,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4439" target="_blank">01:13:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably wouldn't be going, right?

And so you just have to acknowledge that almost everything you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4447" target="_blank">01:14:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">already doing is because of some view of your future self. But now it's actually thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4454" target="_blank">01:14:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">about it. In psychology, they often call it the default future, that people have that default</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4458" target="_blank">01:14:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">future that they're just like... It's the future that they've already pre-committed to, even if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4462" target="_blank">01:14:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not the one that they would want.

So I think a step is honestly just stepping back a little bit and looking at your life and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4476" target="_blank">01:14:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">being like, "Okay, I am going to work 40-60 hours a week. Why? Because I need to pay." There are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4482" target="_blank">01:14:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons why. And then starting to actually give yourself permission to the idea of want, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4488" target="_blank">01:14:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about, "What would I want?

And beginning in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4492" target="_blank">01:14:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, no, that's really interesting. And so if someone's not sure what their future self</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4498" target="_blank">01:14:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">should be, it sounds like a good step is to write down what it is now because it already exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4504" target="_blank">01:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You already have an idea.

There is no "should" with me being a father of six kids,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or even being a good father. And so when you actually start to give yourself the permission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4562" target="_blank">01:16:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of like, "What would I want?" Then it can start to come from an intrinsic place. And then you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4568" target="_blank">01:16:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">start to really create it. But no, I really don't think there's... I mean, obviously I wrote a book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4573" target="_blank">01:16:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Be Your Future Self Now. 10x is easier than 2x.

But it really is a constant process. As an example, the future self that I'm imagining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4584" target="_blank">01:16:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is quite different than the future self I was imagining even at the beginning of this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4588" target="_blank">01:16:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or even three months ago. And so it's a nonstop process. That's why the past and the future are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4592" target="_blank">01:16:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">simply tools. They're not things that are fixed in place. They're things that are constantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4597" target="_blank">01:16:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">evolving and changing. And so you don't have to have... I look at it like the draft of a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4602" target="_blank">01:16:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't need...

But at the same time, in a month from now, I'm going to probably know a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4615" target="_blank">01:16:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of things I don't know. And maybe those are going to tilt my plan, shift them. And so I just think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUkUE8Pf-Q&t=4618" target="_blank">01:16:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that's part of just viewing it as a continuous process.
