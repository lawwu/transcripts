Well let me start with an illustration. I read this years ago in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Edward John Carnell's book, oh the name just slips my mind, Christian Commitment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the name of it.

But Carnell's point is that Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">duty is deeper than physical acts, always deeper than physical acts. Our duty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">includes not only the external physical acts that are appropriate, virtuous, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">also a right heart or a right disposition or right set of affections,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">emotions.

I might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">misunderstand her, but let's see if this helps. She asks, "Is love fake if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's motivated by duty?

That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sounds like she conceives of love as a set of external behaviors which one can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">will even if one does not feel any gladness in the act of love. But is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that the biblical duty of love? Does not love, biblically speaking, include more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyArQpN1py4&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">than mere physical behavior?
