I'm an entrepreneur in Belgium and I have two questions regarding time blocking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=11" target="_blank">00:00:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First question is, is there an optimal aspect ratio between fixed time blocks and time blocks that you can schedule freely in the weekly review leading up to the week to come?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I have a number of fixed tasks that I need to do every week, such as for instance invoicing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can put those in a repetitive time block into Outlook, but I'm looking for an optimal, if there is an optimal aspect ratio between those fixed, pre-fixed time blocks and those that I can fill in week to week depending on the tasks that I want to work on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Second question is, is there an optimal aspect ratio between deep work time blocks and the non-deep work time blocks in which I have to do the daily grind as a matter of speech?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you could provide some insight into that, I would be largely thankful. Thank you. Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Gert, let's start with your first question. And just to clarify this for those who are listening, what I believe Gert is asking about is the difference between time blocks you put on your calendar in advance when you're doing your weekly plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's Monday morning, you're doing your weekly plan and you say Thursday at noon, I'm doing invoicing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The balance between those and the time blocks you figure out each day when you're doing your daily time block planning, oh, how do I want to spend the hours today, where you look at what is not already taken up on your calendar, and you work with that free time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So first, I want to say there's generally two types of things that will go on your calendar during weekly planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So events, appointments, meetings, that goes to your calendar directly, right, as soon as you organize them. But what are the type of time blocks you might add to your calendar in advance?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's typically two categories here. There is blocks that come out of autopilot scheduling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is something that emerged from my original work on time management for students, in which I like to take regularly occurring work, work that occurs every week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you have to do it. And you find a set time and place you do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I call that autopilot scheduling because you don't have to think about that work. It just shows up on your calendar like a doctor's appointment or a meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You just know this is when I do it. Autopilot scheduling lives on your calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now you're putting time aside for regular occurring work. And in fact, you might be doing this for the entire semester, for the entire quarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm always going to do invoices on Thursday afternoon. Let me just make that a repeated appointment on my calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there is advanced scheduling. So sometimes when you're working on your weekly plan, you look at some things that are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a non-trivial task. It really has to get done this week. I'm going to put aside the time right now for when that's going to get done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you put that on your calendar. So that also is a way that work gets on your calendar in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me make that concrete from my own life this week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was doing my weekly plan, I saw one of the things on my plate that was important is reviewing faculty applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm on a search committee, and a bunch of applications have come in, and there's a batch of these I have to review before we meet next week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a long task. It takes time to go through all these applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I already put on my calendar last Monday, recording this on Thursday, last Monday, I put on my calendar a big block for tomorrow for Friday, in which I'm going to do that application processing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why? Because it was important, it had to get done, and it was going to require a non-trivial amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted to protect that time in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So between autopilot scheduling and advanced scheduling, you might have a fair amount of stuff on your calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Each day you time block plan, when you build your time block plan, you transfer those onto your plan, and then you make decisions about what to do with the time that remains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there an ideal ratio here? I will tell you, Gert, this has been my thinking more recently, has been shifting towards more on your calendar in advance is better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have just been having this thought, and I'll tell you where it came out of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because I wrote this New Yorker article recently on slow productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the big ideas behind slow productivity, you've heard me talk about on the podcast, when that article I focused in on one particular piece of slow productivity, which is work volume needs to be lower when you have a very large work volume.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the number of things on your plate that needs to get done, when that gets too big, lots of bad things happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Short circuits our planning brain, the planning portion of our brain that makes us anxious, and the fixed collaborative overhead of all these things begins to eat up all of our schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to try to keep our work volume reasonable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Moving more work directly onto your calendar to say this is when I'm going to do that work is an implicit mechanism to help keep your work volume more reasonable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you have to find the time for when you were going to do something at the moment that you're committing to do it, you will be facing the reality of your schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you say, yeah, I will review these applications, you need four hours to do it and say, I have to go find those four hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You might realize you don't have those four hours for another couple of weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you can be realistic about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you get to that week where you have to do the four hours application review, and you've already protected that time on Friday, and now you don't have any other time on that Friday to do other things and those other things don't get on your schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've increasingly been a believer of maybe we should pre allocate more time for more work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it forces us to confront that our time is a scarce resource.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's how much I'm already using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No fixed ratio Gert, do whatever seems reasonable, but do not be worried if you find your calendar is very crowded with work you have placed there in advance from autopilot and advanced scheduling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't be upset about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually think that is a good approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now to get to your second question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the deep to shallow work ratio that I talked about in my book, Deep Work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something that many people have now deployed in their own work environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you should have a clear ratio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you should have an answer to this question you're asking, how many deep work hours to shallow work hours?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I trying to hit in a standard week?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This should be a number that you establish with whoever supervises or manages you so everyone is on the same page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You should then use your time block plan as a record to look back and say how much did I actually do deep work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How much time did I actually do shallow work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What was the ratio I hit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it is below the ratio that you decided on with your manager, with your supervisor, then you have a clear number to say we have to change something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We said I should do 50/50 and I'm only doing 25% of my time deep work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKL_UaNOOo&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something has to give and you have a number here to make that clear.</span></div><div

have discovered, hearing from my readers who have used this method, the ratio can vastly differ depending on what your job is and what season you're in of your job.</span></div><div class="c"><span
