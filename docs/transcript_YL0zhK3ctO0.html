Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will phase in using VantageScore, so later this year. The main thing is that because the VantageScore 4.0 has limited credit history that it can work off of, there's about 30 plus million people that might actually be able to get a credit score that couldn't previously.</p><p>The VantageScore 4.0, which is their latest version of the score, actually takes into account trending, which is one of the things that's been more interesting for people because it looks at a view over time. With this change, lenders will be able to choose between getting reports from two of the three major bureaus, so they don't need to get all three of them, and they can choose which model they use.</p><p>It's gonna give a little bit more flexibility. It'll be interesting to see how this evolves</p></div></div></body></html>
