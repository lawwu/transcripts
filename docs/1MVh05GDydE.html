I played in some pretty competitive environments. I helped HubSpot launch their CRM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">almost a decade ago. And at that time, that was a crazy competitive category. People thought we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">bonkers. My guess is if I took a raise of hand, probably over 50% of your companies are using that CRM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">today.

And so a little history about Reforge is that we've been around for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about 10 years. We've helped thousands of product teams, including all the ones you see here, over 100,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">professionals.

And the way that we've done it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">is that we've built a community of over 400 experts on the front lines to decode all of their best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">practices.

And the way that we start to answer this question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually, we need to think about the traps.

So even though AI products and features, of course, use one of these Legos as its core Lego</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">blocks, this is not where differentiation and competitive advantage comes from. That starts with one of these pieces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">your data. Because your data is what provides context to an AI model to generate a unique output. The more unique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">your data is, the more unique output you can generate for your customer. And there's a bunch of different types of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's real-time data that the models might not have incorporated into their training set. There's user-specific data. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">domain-specific data, like we've seen emerging in legal, in healthcare. There's human judgment data around curation, as well as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">data. Now the question about data is, how do you actually combine multiple categories of data together to form some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">uniqueness? As well as, it's not about the quantity of your data, it's about marginal value of your data over everybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">else, especially the big models. So how much additional value does your data add over what is already trained in the models?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The third piece is your functionality, because this determines how the AI behaves and it gives your AI product superpowers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's multiple types of Lego blocks around your functionality. Specialized workflows, unique algorithms, business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">rules, integrations, whatever it is that's baked into your product. Now the key about assembling all these pieces is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they work like a system. And you have to connect the system in order to build that competitive differentiation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's start with this. Your data is what provides and informs the AI's understanding. It's what helps the AI generate a unique output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that unique output, as a result, is what helps you build an additional repository of unique data so that it continues to flow in a flywheel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other side of the spectrum is your functionality. Your functionality in your product is how your product controls the AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">actions, how it interacts with AI, when it calls it to create a delightful user experience. And in addition, AI is increasingly able to call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tools in the functionality of your product itself. And those two things work together as a system as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's take all of this theory and let's put it into practice. Let's talk about a product, granola.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Just by a raise of hands, how many people have either tried or used granola today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, pretty decent amount. That's probably like 40% of the room. A year ago, that would have been zero. And I think this is an interesting case, because they entered a space that already had a horde of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a horde of other AI note-takers, whether that was Fathom, Otter, Fireflies. There was a ton of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But somehow, they found a seam. And they've garnered 40% of your attention in this room and about $50 million in funding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's go back to those three fundamental questions in those Lego bricks. What was uniquely theirs? Their data, their functionality, and their understanding of their unmet customer need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm going to start with the last one. So, at the time when they entered the market space, this is just a sample of people who are already in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">market, including all of the incumbents like Zoom and Meet that have AI-native note-taking capabilities. But they were all approaching it from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective of the product is going to do something for the user. It's going to replace the full job. They want somebody else to take my meeting notes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What they realized is actually there's a whole other set of customer needs that have been unmet, which is, I don't want you to take all of my notes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want you to help me take better notes, empower me around this specific task and user. And that's what they built the product around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in order to start, they used off-the-shelf capabilities. No unique models, no custom training, nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They used Deepgram for transcription. They used Anthropic and OpenAI for some of their other functionality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But the uniqueness came in how they assembled the Lego blocks, starting on the left-hand side with Granola's data, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Their context includes both the notes that you take as well as the transcription that they generate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They used the AI Lego block to generate a unique output, which is they enhance better notes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Those notes, over time, form a repository that starts to enable all sorts of other features that they've layered on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like chatting across meetings, their project workspaces, all their downflow actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So they have this nice flywheel of unique context in data that's starting to spin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That was partially enabled by the right-hand side of the Lego blocks, their functionality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They used a Mac app so that they could detect when meetings started to access the system sound for transcription,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like being right there at the user moment that they needed it to enable the AI to do those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they've also plugged into other tools and integrations like the calendar to get metadata about the meetings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MVh05GDydE&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">such as attendees.
