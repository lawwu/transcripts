The track proved very useful for many listeners and we wanted to play it in this podcast stream. Here now is Shane and Shane performing "Though You Slay Me" featuring a sermon clip from John Piper. I come, God I come, return to the Lord, the one who's broken, the one who's torn me apart. You strike down to bind me up, you say you'd do it all in love, that I might know you in your suffering. Though you slay me, yet I will praise you, though you take from me, I will bless your name. Though you ruin me, still I will worship, sing a song to the one is all I need. My heart and flesh may fail, the earth below give way, but with my eyes, with my eyes I'll see the Lord. Lifted high on that day, behold the Lamb that was slain, and I'll know that every tear was worth it all. Though you slay me, yet I will praise you, though you take from me, I will bless your name. Though you ruin me, still I will worship, sing a song to the one is all I need. My heart and flesh may fail, the earth below give way, but with my eyes, with my eyes I'll see the Lord. You're enough for me, you're enough for me. Not only is all your affliction momentary, not only is all your affliction light in comparison to eternity and the glory there, but all of it is totally meaningful. Every millisecond of your pain from the fallen nature or fallen man, every millisecond of your misery in the path of obedience is producing a peculiar glory you will get because of that. I don't care if it was cancer or criticism, I don't care if it was slander or sickness, it wasn't meaningless. It's doing something, it's not meaningless, of course you can't see what it's doing. Don't look to what is seen. When your mom dies, when your kid dies, when you've got cancer at 40, when a car careens into the sidewalk and takes her out, don't say, "It's meaningless!" It's not. It's working for you an eternal weight of glory. Therefore, therefore, do not lose heart. But take these truths and day by day focus on them. Preach them to yourself every morning. Get alone with God and preach His Word into your mind until your heart sings with confidence that you are new and cared for. Though you slay me, yet I will praise you. Though you take from me, I will bless your name. Though you ruin me, still I will worship. Sing a song to the one who's all I need. I'll sing a song to the one who's all I need. That is beautifully heartbreaking. Special thanks to our friends Shane and Shane. You can find out more about them online at ShaneandShane.com. And the John Piper clip is taken from a sermon titled "Do Not Lose Heart," a sermon you can find online at DesiringGod.org. And if you know someone who is battling for faith in the darkness of personal trial right now, would you consider sharing this episode with them? I'm your host Tony Reinke. I'll see you tomorrow.</p></div></div></body></html>
