that I want to try to dig into more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=12" target="_blank">00:00:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's do a deep dive to start today's episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And the question I want to tackle is the following is TikTok a good thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it seems like an unusual question for me to be asking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot about this service TikTok that does not exactly seem to be right up my Cal Newport style alley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I am not a huge fan of the fact that they are trying to basically cut out the middleman and just make a direct path to your brainstem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes addictive entertainment and says, well, can't we just pump that up to 11 instead of making this accidentally addictive?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Why don't we actually just get the absolute perfect format with the exact right music cues and just shoot these things that people want after another with an algorithm driving it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't love that.</span></div><div

creators emotional systems to get them to spend more time doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">TikTok just says they admit it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We manipulate your views like a slot machine that gives you a few quarters every once in a while so that you'll keep pulling that proverbial handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're new to TikTok, they will early on show your video to a lot of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So you feel like you're right on the cusp of breaking out that people really like what you have to do, that you have this audience out there and then they pull it back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">They withhold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No views, no views.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'll show it to a lot more people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Another video, you're like, oh, I'm almost there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I got to keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I almost had three cherries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I get three cherries, I'm going to be Kim Kardashian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't love all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Wouldn't be my favorite thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm very interested and I have a very optimistic view on TikTok because I believe it represents an evolution in the social media industry that ultimately is a very positive evolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about this before in various question answers scattered throughout recent episodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to consolidate these thoughts right here into this deep dive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Starting around 2012, 2013, we entered this period of monopoly social media platforms that brought with them, and this was the key part, an expectation of universal usage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was this era of Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and a few other claimants to the throne that came and went, where not only did everyone use them, but it was weird if you didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I talk about this a lot on this show, but I know that from firsthand experience, because I was pilloried for not using these services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It was considered extreme.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It was considered monastic and unusual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There is people that were driven to anger by the concept that I wasn't on these platforms that wanted to debate me publicly and couldn't imagine it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I was ambushed on national radio shows, the New York Times commissioned op-eds just about the weirdness of not taking social media serious and Cal not using it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it was a technology that was assumed you had to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was the piece of the social media revolution that always made me really uncomfortable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I used to say this again and again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think social media should be like Game of Thrones, something that a lot of people really like and enjoy, but there's also a ton of people that have nothing to do with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what it should be like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like if you didn't know what the dragon riders' spells were in Game of Thrones, you were going to be yelled at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what it was like for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">TikTok represents something different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">TikTok is pure entertainment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way we got to TikTok, the way we got there is that the social media services that we've talked about before on the show, they used to be about connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It used to be about everyone you know is on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where everyone is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This will connect you to those people, people you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to use our service because your cousin's not on this new service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Your cousin's on Facebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to know what your cousin's up to, you have to be on Facebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they shifted and said, how do we get these people to click on our app more?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they said, let's be about entertainment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to give you a newsfeed or infinite scroll timeline of interesting things to look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they shifted away from connecting you to people you know and towards let's give you a infinite scrolling torrent of algorithmically optimized content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was in that world that TikTok said, hold my beer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If that's what we're doing, why don't we just do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, forget like posts from your cousin, forget, you know, Ben Shapiro articles being retweeted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just go straight to the jugular here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Videos with music and they move really fast and they're short and it's one after another, one after another, one after another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we aggressively use algorithms to find the video that you really want to watch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">They just cut out the middleman and purified this infinite stream entertainment model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why this is a good thing is that it does not bring with it an expectation of universal usage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-DiG81mco8&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes,
