This is actually kind of relevant to what we're going to be talking about. Um, because the topic for today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so the topic that we're going to be talking today is, um, what, what, what is it that makes our church weird? Like, why are we a weird church? What are the things that people find weird when they first come? Um, so I mean, I, you know, I was born here. So I don't want to use our Stephen. Like what, what, what is, why are we a weird church?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what, what, what is it that makes our church weird?

So let's write it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. We'll write it down. Um, you write down yours. I won't look at it. I'll write down mine. Just the top reason why we're a weird church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The top one thing that really captures it, right?

So seriously, let's get into this for real. Okay. So we are a weird church. We're just kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">straight out weird. Um, so, uh, can I get the hat? Yeah. This is a, we're just going to get it all out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We're calling it the weird hat. We just found this in the joyland room here. Um, and we just put,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we just wrote down some things, um, and we're just going to pull something out of the hat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about it a little bit.

Like you come in and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like everyone greets you.

Like, Oh, hi, what's your name? What are you doing here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, you know, on one level, it's admirable. It means like everyone's really trying as opposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to like, I don't want to be welcome.

But for me, I'm just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that's just not me, I guess, even though I grew up here, I just need a people, a couple of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to just be like, yo, what's up?

It's called being too Joe, being too Joe. It's, it's basically acting more familiar with someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">than you actually are.

So things like, um, calling each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">other by your first and last name or saying devastating or hurting or, oh my, or that's too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">All of those are like grace point lingos that all came from Pastor Manny.

Hurting is my favorite one. Cause there's certain situations in life that you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">capture with anything other than that word. Like it's just, just the cringe and the pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

We're trying, like, we try to temper that down, but, um, you hang out with us enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and you'll be saying those things too. So it's just, it's coming for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Fair warning. Yeah. All right. Let's go to the next one. Next one here is, um, oh, media stance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So this is one I personally experienced for sure. Like no TVs and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, well, okay. No TV is not weird anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Not anymore. It's much, huh?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But back when we were in freshmen, it was, yeah, I walked in my, my leader's living room. I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have a TV in your living room. Right. And at first it was weird. And then it was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, it's, we're too busy. And we just hang out with each other. And I was like, okay, that's cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, you know, people would pull out like a projector for a movie, which was fine. But now I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have a TV and people think that's weird. So, but, but that's not, it's not just TV. Right. It's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it's more than that. Yeah. I mean, this one, I definitely felt growing up because I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously I'm the pastor's kid. So I grew up in that household. Um, you know, we had no TV,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">no video games. So, you know, people would ask me at school, like, are you guys Amish? And I didn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't know what Amish was back then, but I was saying, I don't, I don't think so maybe. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but yeah, so that was one that like I experienced, I understood it on like a theoretical level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">but I definitely hated it. Um, and I do think, uh, I, I don't know, that can be tough to adjust to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it was tough for me to adjust to, I like, I was constantly trying to like sneak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">computer games and video games behind my parents back and getting in trouble and that sort of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was, I mean, I guess every kid does that to some extent, but that was that, that I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely is something that takes some getting adjusted to. Um, I think that's changed also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I think our stance on media has relaxed over the years, but maybe that's something we'll get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">some more like in the later episode. Yeah.

It was about like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">oh man, I forget right now.

There's like this whole, like, yeah. I mean, it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it comes down to the thing that everyone wants to talk about at a college church, which is dating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

That's not true. We do not forbid dating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe we did in the past.

I feel like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">so then that's something that people cite like, okay, so then, oh, I'm gonna, you know, I'm gonna be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">good sport about this.

And then the other thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">is like when people do get like, well, this is kind of a little bit additional, but it's the secrecy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of the dating a little bit.

And then like, and then, so, so then you, you know, you come as a freshman and you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you know, you got this guy who's mentoring you. It's great. And then like suddenly one day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">out of the blue, he goes, oh, by the way, I'm engaged.

But I mean, I grew up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was very, it wasn't to the extent that they had our church now, but like, I grew up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">people in my home, like my backyard was my swimming pool was used as a, the jacuzzi was used as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">baptistry for a little bit. That's nice. And like, yeah, the people were over, my parents had all kinds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of like just fellowship groups over and missionaries, pastors staying in our house, all kinds of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was just sort of like, God blessed us with a pretty big house. And my parents were like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">we just want to open it for people. So yeah, this one kind of weird, a little bit, I think maybe more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">weird today, because people go over to those homes anymore. But like, it's just precedent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you like that growing up?

And then after that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">when parents left, they didn't tell their kids to clean up the toys. So I got really bitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why don't they clean up after themselves? And I had to do the cleaning up. So please,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're hanging out someone else's house, clean up your stuff.

This one's interesting. People ask me, where were you? So I don't know if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">this still happens, but this definitely happened back in my days. So this probably still happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But just like, you know, you're at Bible study one week, you're not there the next week. And then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">following week, someone, some well-intentioned older person be like, oh, hey, where were you last week?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Yeah. I'm guilty of that. Yeah, for sure. And then I think a lot of people feel like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">whoa, am I not allowed to have not been here, you know? And it feels like pressure. It feels like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">why are you prying into my business? And so I don't know. I feel like that kind of falls under this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">larger umbrella of just like pressure because I think our church is very high commitments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a just high rate of people who show up to a lot of stuff. Right. So like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">at least when I was in college, you know, if you were one of like our regulars, that meant you were at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">every Bible study, every prayer meeting, every Sunday service. And if you missed it, it would be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it would be kind of like, oh, where were you? Like, because we were so used to seeing each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">other all the time. People would show up even if they were like horribly sick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'd be like, you've got to just rest. Yeah. We'd have to tell people like, go home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's kind of how committed people were. Yeah. Don't get me sick. So that was kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of the culture. But if you were new and you were coming into that and you're not like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not yet my group, or I don't consider myself like regular at this group yet, to experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that could feel like, whoa, these people are a little too intense, a little too fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Oh, you didn't show up or, you know, and it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you can read that. So for me, so for me, I experienced this my freshman year. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">so I, I remember telling my mentor, like, who's like the nicest guy, but I was telling him like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, I, I really want to get plugged in here.

I want to get fed, mentored. It was the first time I had like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">lead, like really, you know, dedicated, like spiritual leaders mentoring me. And it was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a really good conversation we had.

And then I missed like the next three Sunday services, because I overslept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I was, I tried out for like a theater troupe.

Yeah. Being particularly Asian, not knowing that we're really Asian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And not realizing how different that was culturally for some people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, we're going to, we're going to be talking about a lot more of these issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to get some like other people's, like, what was your experience when you first came to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">church? Maybe do some interviews. Yeah. Interviews as well as I think doing a deeper dive into some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0RG8u-p70&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">of these things.
