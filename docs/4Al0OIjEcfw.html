class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I think will be helpful for me to do here is to step back and try to understand why it is that sometimes it is good and appropriate for a Christian to work in an institution where perhaps nobody else is a believer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and why sometimes it would be inappropriate or harmful to work in such a setting, and why that would be the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would be the difference between when it's good and when it's not good?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we'll take a hospital as an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just suppose, for the sake of the illustration, that nobody else in this hospital is a Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody. Just this one nurse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What that means biblically, according to Romans 14.23 and Hebrews 11.6, is that virtually everything done in this hospital by everybody except this woman is sinful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because without faith, it is impossible to please God, and whatever is not from faith is sin, those two texts say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's the other massively important fact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because of God's common grace, and because some of his law is written on every human heart, including unbelievers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and because there are in many of these unbelieving medical employees vestiges of external Christian virtue, the shell left over from when their parents or grandparents believed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because of those three facts, most of the practices and most of the short-term goals of this healing institution are externally the same practices and the same short-term goals that this Christian nurse is pursuing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They pursue them in unbelief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">She pursues them because of her faith in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All kinds of surgeries, all kinds of medications, all kinds of therapies and policies of care and protection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unbelievers are pursuing these, and she's pursuing these because their external form is the form of Christ-exalting love, which for her are acts of worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But for the unbelievers, they're justified by man-centered values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And given what hospitals are for, there is a remarkable external behavioral overlap, like doing surgery or short-term goal, like making the patient comfortable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is an amazing overlap between the Christ-exalting love of the nurse and the man-centered, unbelieving humanism of the other staff, an overlap of external forms of virtue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, one of the remarkable things about this situation is that the external practices and the short-term goals flow so naturally from both the heart of the Christian nurse and the hearts of unbelievers that neither assumes that the other is a Christian or a non-Christian because of participation in these shared practices and goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Christian nurse does not feel compromised by her working there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't imply that she shares the unbelieving worldview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what happens when some of God's common grace is withheld and God's law written on the heart is more deeply suppressed and the vestiges of external Christian virtue from previous generations are more fully abandoned?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens is that some of the overlap between Christ-exalting, faith-rooted Christian behavior and unbelieving behavior is lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the overlap is lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, the hospital staff, instead of caring for old people, now may euthanize them, kill them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of caring for mothers and babies in crisis pregnancies, they may kill the children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of helping men flourish as men and women flourish as women, they pursue the illusion of surgically and hormonally turning men into women and women into men, which can never happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Suddenly, or not so suddenly, the powers that be in the hospital have shifted from the common grace of healing to the demonic purpose of destruction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of palliative compassion for the aged, they destroy them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of prenatal and postnatal care, they destroy the unborn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of valuing God-given maleness and God-given femaleness, they destroy them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the first two cases, the destruction is death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the case of surgically or hormonally trying to make women out of men or men out of women, they not only reject God's good design for male and female,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but they set in motion often irreversible contradictions between body and soul that lead to miseries that our generation has scarcely begun to imagine over the next decades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which means that now we have a new situation for our Christian nurse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the new practices and the new short-term goals are no longer common grace flowing from unbelieving hearts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the practices and goals themselves, not just their unbelieving roots, but the goals and practices themselves are contrary to God's will, deeply destructive for those who ought to be getting care, not harm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Christian nurse is faced with a new challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not, "How do I act as a Christian in pursuing shared views of external good?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">(Which is what she's been living with for time, up until these new practices.)</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:09:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, "Can I act as a Christian in sharing practices and goals that no longer reflect God's common grace, no longer reflect God's law written on the heart, no longer reflect any vestiges of long-abandoned Christian virtue?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And my encouragement to this nurse is, "No."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because now your skill and ministry are no longer simply a bona fide participation in a common grace of healing done in the name of Jesus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but now your skill and ministry have to be used in a setting where the external manifestations of God's order are openly defied and where untold damage is being done to sometimes desperate people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which means that your participation becomes, against your will, a support for contradicting God's revealed will, for damaging people, and for bringing part of the ongoing normalization of evil in this hospital and in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Al0OIjEcfw&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I encourage you to seek the
