sitting on the couch, staying at home more, don't really want to leave or go out or go to dinner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdiyFsq4z_E&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, you know, this relaxed relationship, I was the happiest I could have ever

live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdiyFsq4z_E&t=2439" target="_blank">00:40:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, people will come up to you

out in Scottsdale in probably a year and a half, two years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdiyFsq4z_E&t=2548"
