Wait till it comes full moon, you get a real sense of what it looks like. It's beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ7ECcjXazw&t=69">00:01:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a beautiful high resolution image.

And you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ7ECcjXazw&t=96">00:01:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">my favorite watch now. Joe, thank you. Actually, this is the one thing I think a watch could add,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ7ECcjXazw&t=103">00:01:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is perspective on the cosmic scale. That's why I like that watch. And that's why I think you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ7ECcjXazw&t=108">00:01:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">should have it.
