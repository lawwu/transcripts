Because it is not free. There are fees. And the way I think about it is there's really only one reason, and that's that you're getting a positive ROI. Now, those fees range from as low as 1.75% all the way up to around 3%.</p><p>We'll talk about that a little more, which means you need to be using a credit card that earns more than that for it to make sense. And I would argue a lot more than that, or at least a decent amount more than that, unless you're just interested in buying points.</p><p>Now, that might be a thing you are interested in. There's no easy way to buy transferable points from most of the different banks out there. So this could be an opportunity to buy some transferable points. But I think the really interesting opportunity is when you can use this to earn more value than what you're paying.</p><p>And that could even be a spread on cash back.</p></div></div></body></html>
