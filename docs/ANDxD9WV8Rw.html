Two wants, two wills in God, not just one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not accurate to say that God will not do what he wants to do, since in choosing to do what he does not want to do, he's doing, in another sense, what he does want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Complicated sentence, but just hit

to the conclusion that God is schizophrenic or double-minded or perpetually frustrated, because there are ways in the infinite complexity of God's mind and heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are ways that he experiences his multiple desires, his layers of desires or wants or wills, in perfect harmony, each expressing some aspect of his nature in proper unity with other aspects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me illustrate what I mean when I say the Bible repeatedly points to these different levels or ways of wanting or willing in God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, now in 1 Timothy 2.4, the text that Tim is asking about, Paul says, "God desires," now that word is "thelae" in the Greek, which means "wills" or "desires."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Wills all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth, but he does not save all."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, why not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody has to face this, not just certain groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone who believes, as all Christians do, in the wisdom and power and goodness of God would say that the answer is some other will or some other desire or commitment of God takes precedence over the desire for all to be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think everybody would say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One group, sometimes called Arminians, says it's because God is more committed to our free will, our ultimate self-determination, than he is to saving all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The desire to preserve human self-determination takes precedence over the desire for all to be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be the way an Arminian would describe it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other group, sometimes called Calvinists, says that God is more committed to glorifying his own free and sovereign grace than he is to saving all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I think this second answer is right, and one of the reasons I do is because of what 2 Timothy 2, 25 and 26 say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There, Paul says that we should exhort sinners with patience and gentleness and "God may perhaps grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth," which is a phrase from back in 1 Timothy 2, 4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the reason some people believe and some do not believe is not because they have ultimate self-determination, but because God may or may not grant them to repent and believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a gift of sovereign grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, God wills that all be saved, but in another sense, he does not will that all be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of these inclinations is a real expression of compassion, and the other is a real expression of sovereign wisdom and the freedom of grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm going to come back to that with an illustration from history that might make it a little more intelligible, but let's keep giving illustrations of this idea of multiple layers of willing or desiring in God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's another example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He commands, "Thou shalt not murder," in Exodus 20, 13.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's God's will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But Acts 4:27 says that "Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, in murdering Jesus," they all teamed up and murdered him, "did whatever God's hand and God's plan had predestined to take place."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, God planned the death of his son at the hands of murderous, wicked men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our salvation hangs on this reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is at the center of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This issue of God's sovereignty over sinful men is at the center of the gospel, not some marginal theological dispute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, God's will that his son be murdered took precedence over his will that people not murder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible students for centuries have seen this and have called these two wills by various names like "will of command" and "will of decree," or another set of phrases is "moral will" and "sovereign will."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a third example of these two layers or levels or kinds of willing in God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Thou shalt not lie," Exodus 20, 16.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, God's will is that people tell the truth and not be misled, not think false thoughts, and not deceive others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yet, in 2 Thessalonians 2, 10, it says, "People refuse to love the truth and so be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, God sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they believe what is false, they speak what is false, they think what is false, and Paul says, "God sent this delusion as a punishment."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, God's will that people believe the truth and speak the truth is subordinated, in their case, to God's other will, which is manifest in his sending them further into deception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's another

"I do not have pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, God often, in the Bible, justly takes the life of the wicked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that the Bible over and over points to the mind and heart of God as complex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=677"

story that there was a certain Major Andre who had committed treason and put the new American Republic at risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And George Washington signed Andre's death warrant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he's about to be executed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And John Marshall comments in his biography, "Perhaps on no occasion of his life did the Commander in Chief obey with more reluctance the stern mandates of duty and policy."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, two wills were operating in Washington, compassion and justice.</span></div><div

"Washington's volition to sign the death warrant of Andre did not arise from the fact that his compassion was slight or feigned, unreal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but from the fact that it was rationally counterpoised by a complex of superior judgments of wisdom, duty, patriotism, and moral indignation."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then he adds, "The pity was real but was restrained by superior elements of motive."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Washington had official and bodily power to discharge the criminal, but he had no sanctions in his own wisdom and justice to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That willing in God, that desiring in God is real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The fact that there are two wills in God points to a profound but complex unity in revealing aspects of God's nature that are both true and both real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In our own experience, we may feel them as conflicting or as frustrating, but I think it would be rash to say that God experiences his compassion and the justice of his wrath that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDxD9WV8Rw&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.000</a></span> | <span
