I think Mark was a bit optimistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was probably acting like a good CEO would to inspire a vision and also probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to keep the Facebook stock price up. But what Mark also did was create a lot of trouble</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for CTOs worldwide. Why? Because after Mark said that, every single CEO in the world almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">turned to their CTO and said, "Hey, Mark says he's going to replace all of his developers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">with AI. Where are we in that journey?" And the answer probably was, honestly, not very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">far.

So AI or using AI for coding is not a one size fits all solution. And there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are cases in which it shouldn't be used. And so for the past three years, we've been running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the largest studies on software engineering productivity at Stanford. And we've done this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">in a time series and cross sectional way. So time series, meaning that even if a participant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">joins in 2025, we get access to their get history, meaning we can see trends of data across time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we can see COVID, we can see AI, we can see all of these trends and things that happened. And then also cross-sectional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because we have more than 600 companies participating, enterprise, mid-sized, and also startups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this means that we have more than 100,000 software engineers in our data set right now, dozens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of millions of commits, and billions of lines of code. And most importantly, most of this data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is private repositories. This is important because if you use a public repo to measure someone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">productivity, that public repo is not self-contained. Someone could be working on that repo on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">weekend or once in a while, right? Whereas if you have a private repo, it's much more self-contained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and much easier to measure the productivity of a team, of a company, of an organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So late last year, there was a huge controversial thing around ghost engineers. So this came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">from kind of the same research group, our research group. And here, Elon Musk was kind enough to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">retweet us. But what we found is that roughly 10% of software engineers in our data set at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">time, about 50,000, were what we called ghost engineers. These people collect a paycheck but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">basically do no work. So that was very surprising for some people, very unsurprising for others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so some of the people in this research team are, for example, Simon from industry. So he was CTO at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a unicorn, which he exited. And he had a team of about 700 developers. And a CTO, he was always the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">last person to know when something was up with his engineering team, right? And so he thought, okay, how can I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">change this? Myself, I've been at Stanford since 22. And I focus on what I call data driven decision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">making and software engineering. And in a past life, I was looking after digital transformation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for a large company with thousands of engineers. Part of the team is also Professor Kaczynski,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">who is at Stanford, and his research focuses on human behavior in a digital environment. And basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he was the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower back in the day, if you recall that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So today, we're going to be talking about three things. We're going to start off with the limitations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of existing studies that seek to quantify the impact of AI on developer productivity. We're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">showcase our methodology. And lastly, we're going to spend most of the time looking at some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">results. What is the impact on AI on deaf productivity? And how are ways we can slice and dice these results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to make them more meaningful? And so there's lots of research being done on this topic. But a lot of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is led by vendors who themselves are trying to sell you their own AI coding tools, right? And so there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a bit of a conflict of interest there sometimes. And the biggest three limitations that I see is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of these studies revolve around commits and PRs and tasks. Hey, we completed more commits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">more PRs, the time between commits decreased. The problem here is that task size varies, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so delivering more commits does not necessarily mean more productivity. And in fact, what we found very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">often is that by using AI, you're introducing new tasks that are bug fixes to the stuff that the AI just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">coded before. So by that case, like you're kind of spinning your wheels in place, right? So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of funny. Secondly, there's a bunch of studies to say, well, we grabbed a bunch of developers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we split them into two groups, and we kind of gave one AI and one of them we didn't. And what usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">happens there is that these are kind of greenfield tasks where they're asked to build something with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of zero context from scratch. And there, of course, AI decimates the non AI people. But that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">both because AI is just really good at greenfield kind of boilerplate code, right? But actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">most of software engineering isn't greenfield and isn't always boilerplate, right? And so there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">usually an existing code base, there's usually dependencies. So these studies can't be like applied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">too well to these situations either. And then we also have surveys, which we found to be an ineffective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">predictor of productivity, by doing the small experiment with 43 developers, whereby we ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">every developer to evaluate themselves, relatively global mean or median, in five percentile buckets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from zero to 100. And then we compare that to their measured productivity, we'll get into what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">means later. But what we found is that asking someone how productive they think they are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is almost as good as flipping a coin, there's very little correlation, right? And so we found that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">people misjudged their productivity by about 30 percentile points. Only one in three people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">actually estimated their productivity within their quartile, one quartile. And I think surveys are great,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they're valuable for surfacing, you know, morale and other issues that cannot be derived from metrics. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">surveys shouldn't be used to measure developer productivity, much less the impact of AI on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">developers. For productivity cases, you can measure it to kind of see how happy they are using AI or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever, I suppose. Great, so now let's dive into our methodology. So in an ideal world, you would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">an engineer who writes code. And this code is evaluated by a panel of 10 or 15 experts, who separately, without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing what every person is answering, evaluates that code based on quality, maintainability, output,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">how long would this take me? How good is it? Right? So kind of like a bucket of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what happens is that you aggregate those results. And we found two things. The first one is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that this panel actually agrees with one another. So it turns out that one engineering expert agrees with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the other engineering expert when they're talking about an objective code in front of them. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">secondly, and probably most importantly, is that you can use this to predict reality. And reality is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">predicted by a panel like this. The problem then is that this is very slow, it's not scalable, it's expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we did is we built a model that essentially automates this, correlates pretty well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's fast, it's scalable, and it's affordable. The way it works is it plugs into Git, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the model analyzes the source code changes of every commit, and quantifies them based on a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these dimensions. And then since every commit has a unique author, a unique SHA, a unique timestamp,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">then you can kind of understand that, okay, the productivity of a team is basically the functionality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of the code they deliver across time, not the lines of code, not the whatever commits, but the fun,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like what that code is doing, right? And so then you can kind of put this in a dashboard and overlay it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">across time and get something similar to this. Great. So now let's dive into some of our results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So here in September is when this company implemented AI. This is a team of about 120 developers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and they were piloting whether they wanted to use, you know, AI and their kind of regular workflow. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we have here these bars, and every bar is the sum total of the output done in that month</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">using our methodology, not lines of code. And we can see that in green, it's added functionality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in gray, it's removed. In blue is refactoring, and in orange is reworked. And so rework versus refactoring,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they both alter existing code, but rework alters code that's much more recent, meaning it's wasteful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Refactoring could be wasteful, could be not wasteful. And so from the get go, you see that by implementing AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you get a bunch more of rework. What happens is that you feel like you're delivering more code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's just like more volume of code being written, more commits, more stuff being pushed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But not all of that is actually useful. To be clear, I think there, I mean, based on this chart and overall,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a productivity boost of about 15 to 20%. But then a lot of the gains you're seeing are basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of rework, which is a bit, you know, misleading. So if I could summarize it into one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">chart with many discrepancies, it would be something like this. So with AI coding, you generate or you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">increase your productivity by roughly 30, 40%, like you're delivering more code. However, you've got to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">back and kind of fix some of the bugs that code introduced and kind of, you know, fix the the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mess that the AI made, which in turn gives you an average productivity gain across all industries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">all sectors, everything of roughly about 15 to 20%. There's a lot of new ones here, which we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to see in just a second. So here we have two violin charts, and they plot the distributions of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the gains in productivity from using AI. And so kind of like the Y axis is the gains, it starts from minus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">20%, take note, and then it goes up. And here we have kind of four pieces of data being shown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">In blue is low complexity tasks. And in red is high complexity tasks. And kind of like your left,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the chart to the chart to the left is greenfield tasks, the chart to the right is brownfield tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So right from the get go, the first conclusion we have is that sure, it seems like AI performs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">better in coding with simpler tasks. That's good. It's proven by data. That's awesome. The second thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we see is that, hey, it sounds like for low complexity greenfield tasks, there is a much more elongated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution and a much higher distribution on average. Keep in mind that this is for enterprise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">settings. This doesn't apply for kind of like personal projects or vibe coding something for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself from scratch. The improvements there would be much bigger. This is kind of for like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">real world working company settings. And the third thing we see is that if you look at the high complexity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks, I mean, they're lower than the low complexity ones on average in terms of the distribution. But also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in some cases, they are more likely to decrease an engineer's productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this decrease could be for many things, many reasons, but that's kind of what we see in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">data, right? The underlying causes are still not super clear to us. If we translate this to a chart like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this, which is a bit more digestible, you have in the bars and the columns, kind of like the average or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">median gain. And then the line represents the interquartile range. So the bottom of the line is the 25th</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">percentile and the top of the line is roughly 75th percentile. And so here, it's very clear to see how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have, you know, more gains from low complexity tasks, less gains from high complexity tasks. And then brownfield,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it's harder to leverage AI to make increases in productivity there compared to greenfield.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if there is maybe a slide that you could show to your leadership team, it could be this one or could also be this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we have a matrix, really simplifying things. You know, reality is a bit more difficult than this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but here we have kind of, on one axis, task complexity, low and high. On the other one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">project maturity, greenfield versus brownfield. Kind of, we see that, hey, low complexity, greenfield,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">30 to 40 percent gains, right, from AI. High complexity, but greenfield, more modest gains, 10 to 15.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Brownfield and low complexity, pretty good, 15 to 20 percent. And most importantly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">high complexity brownfield tasks, 0 to 10 percent. These are orientative guidelines based on what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we see in the data. And I forgot to mention, this slide has a sample size of 136 teams across 27 companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so pretty representative. And then that's gonna derive, or this chart is derived from that data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Then here, we have a similar matrix, except at the bottom, we have language popularity. So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">low, we have examples such as Kobo, Haskell, Elixir, really kind of obscure stuff. And high is things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like Python, Java, you know, JavaScript TypeScript. And what we see is that AI doesn't really help,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">even with low complexity tasks for low popularity languages. It can help a bit, but it's not terribly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">useful. And what ends up happening is that people just don't use it, because if it's only helpful two times out of five,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're just not gonna use it very often. What's funny or interesting is that for low language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">popularity and complex tasks, AI can actually decrease productivity, because it's so bad at coding in Kobo,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or Haskell, or Elixir, that it just makes you slower, right? Granted, this isn't very, like, this happens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but it may be five or 10% of the kind of global development work, if that, right? Most of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">development work is probably somewhere in the language, in a high language popularity kind of part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the chart. And here, you have gains between 20% for the low complexity, and 10 to 15% for the high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">complexity. So now moving into something a bit more theoretical, less empirically proven, but more so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like what we're seeing in the data, right? This is like an illustrative chart, which has kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">productivity gain from AI on the y-axis and a logarithmic scale of the code base size, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from 1000 lines of code to 10 million on the x-axis. And we see that as the code base size increases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the gains you get from AI decrease sharply, right? And I think most code bases nowadays are kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere in the... depending on your use case, right? But they're bigger than a thousand lines of code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">unless you are a YC startup or something that's, like, kind of spun out a couple months ago, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because, you know, there's three reasons for this, really. Context with no limitations. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">gonna see in a second how performance decreases even with larger context windows. The signal-to-noise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ratio is... kind of confuses the model, if you will. And then, of course, larger code bases have more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">dependencies and more domain-specific logic present. And so then, borrowing work from this paper called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Nolema, which shows you, on a scale of 0 to 100, how LLMs perform on coding tasks, you see that as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">context length increases from 1,000 to 32,000 tokens, performance decreases. And so we see all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">models here. For example, Gemini 1.5 Pro has a context window of 2 million tokens. And you might think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Whoa! I can just throw my entire code base into it, and it's gonna retrieve and encode perfectly,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And what we see is that even at 32,000 tokens, it's already showing a decrease in performance from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">90% to about 50%, right? So what's gonna happen when you move from 32 to 64 or 128, right? You're gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">see really, really poor performance here. And so, in short, AI does increase developer productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You should use AI for most cases, but it doesn't increase the productivity of developers all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">time and equally. It depends on things like task complexity, code base maturity, language popularity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">code base size, and also context length.
