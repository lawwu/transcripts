Who here has productionized an AI product?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice. Okay. Some technical builders. Let's get technical then. So my name is Dat. I'm an AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">architect at Arise AI.

I figured, let's keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it spicy and interesting. But I've been building observability and evals since day zero. So since</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the first, I don't know if you guys know what Arise AI is, but we are the largest AI evals player in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">space. So observability evals kind of beyond. We work really heavily with real use cases. So folks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Reddit, folks like Duolingo. So we work across the best AI teams and we have a really unique business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Being on the observability side, we get to see what everyone is building, how they're tackling those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">problems, what are their biggest pains, and what are kind of the tips and tricks that they use to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">productionize these things. And just to give you a hint, Duolingo has massive eval scale. They tend to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about 20 evals per trace. So they end up spending quite a fair amount doing evals, understanding their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">evals, optimizing them. And the last thing about me, I have a huge passion for the AI community. When I was in SF</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the last five years, I really loved to go to pretty much every single event that I could. I'm not a developer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">advocate. I'm an engineer by trade, but I just love the community. So yeah, this is a little bit about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Rise, but I think I don't want to keep it too salesy. I just want to keep it pretty technical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So really three concepts that I think everybody should be familiar with and where evals really sit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in the space is really as simple as this. This is what I teach all my customers. Really, the first thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is observability. I think you guys have kind of seen this before. Observability really just answers the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">question of what is the thing that I built actually doing, right? To some people, it may be traces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">traces in spans. I'll show you a little bit, you know, platform agnostic. Just think about the concepts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But traces might be one area for people. So traces represent, hey, what's happening? Can I look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">things? To an AI engineer, makes a lot of sense. Let's say you're an AI PM, maybe not super technical,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or maybe you want to think about things differently. Maybe you want to look at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, what are the conversations that are happening? Turns out you can run evals at these levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll get into that in depth kind of later. You know, signal comes and observability comes in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">different kind of flavors and forms. Maybe it's analytics. What we're starting to really realize is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that LLM teams are getting split into two special niches. There's platform teams, right? And they own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">things like the infrastructure. So who here has heard of a model gateway router? It's like an interface</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pattern behind it or all the models, right? Well, it turns out the central LLM platform team tends to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">own that. They care about costs, latency, things like that. And then you have the other LLM teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">These LLM teams sit on the like the outer side of the business, so like a hub and spoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They work for the business side. So these are like the people building the applications to help the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">business. So if anyone here comes from like the ML or data science space, it's actually not far from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And so different teams care about different metrics. So maybe if you're an AI PM sitting on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">business side, you care about evals. If you care about, you know, the platform, maybe you care about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">costs, latency, things like that. But TLDR, observability, observability represents what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And now evals are really important in this space because the reality of the fact is if you've ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">seen a trace or something like that, you're not going to inspect every single trace manually, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not scalable for you an AI engineer or you the AI PM to look through these things. So what is evals used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for? It's actually just a really clever word for signal. You're just trying to understand what's going well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and what's not going well. So I'm not here to sell you on like evals. I think everybody knows how important they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you think evals, evals are LLM as a judge only, there's actually a lot of other tools that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you're missing. So LLM as a judge, raise your hand if you used LLM as a judge. Okay, about half the room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's super great. You use an LLM to give you feedback or process on any process, including an LLM process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're doing RAG, this is a really good way to think about RAG in terms of evals. RAG would be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, user has a question. We retrieve some context to be able to possibly answer that question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we generate an answer. It turns out every arrow on this is actually an eval you can run. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, I retrieve some context and I want to compare that to the query being asked. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that's RAG relevance. It's like, is the thing that I returned even helpful in answering the question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so LLM as a judge is great. It's super helpful. You know, I think most people understand why it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">works, but there's a whole research area on why they're really good indicators. The original task</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is not the eval task, right? So if I asked you a human, hey, generate me a summary on something long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and complex, like the book War and Peace, that's a very different task than say, hey, I wrote this summary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for you. Is it a good one or is it a bad one? But LLM as a judge is a small part. It doesn't always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have to be a large language model or autoregressive model. Things like encoder-only BERT-type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">architectures are super helpful. They're about 10 times cheaper, about one or two orders of magnitudes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">faster to run that eval. But, you know, you don't just have LLMs at your disposal. You, a human,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">also are a really good way to discern signal. So it turns out evals can also come in the form of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is your user having a good or bad experience? So for those people who have productionized some sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of LLM application, do you guys have user feedback? Raise your hand if you've implemented user feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And, okay, about 30%. It's actually incredible signal. So that comes from a human. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you yourself can also generate labels on stuff. So has anyone here heard of a golden data set?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Raise your hand. Okay. Most of the room. And the way I encourage folks to think about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a pro tip, actually. If the first column represents scale. So LLM as a judge is valuable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because I don't have to grade it myself, right? But let's say I don't necessarily trust it off the bat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Use the third column to help you out. So a golden data set represents quality. So you yourself graded it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know that it's what you expected, you know. Well, it turns out you can run your LLM as a judge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on a golden data set. What you're trying to do is say, hey, can the LLM approximate the thing that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">trust? Right? And what that allows you to do is to actually quantify and tune your LLM as a judge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll go over that in a second. But strong pro tip. Most really strong LLM teams in the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of do this today. And it turns out we don't always have to use an LLM or a human. You can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what are called like heuristics or code-based logic. So I'm going to take you into the platform a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bit to talk through it. But in our platform, you have a way to run evals. Great. What code evals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actually are, are just, it's much cheaper. So I'll just run a little test here. But, you know, let's say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to say, hey, does this output contain any keywords? I don't need to use an LLM or a human for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I can just use code. It's infinitely cheaper, faster to run. Does this match this regex pattern,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">XYZ? Is this a parsable JSON? So the reality of it is you have this kind of large toolbox</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in your kind of eval set. So when you say evals, don't just think of LLM as a judge. There's a whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">other set of smarter things that you can use. They're actually more cost effective. And so really, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a really good way to emphasize really the value of like the AI engineer evals and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">observability. Most people understand this left-hand circle, this purple one. It actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">represents what we all want to do. And it's like, hey, build a better AI system, right? So what you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is you collect data, observability, traces, things like that. Then you run some evals to say, hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">did this process go well or did this process not go well? So you're discerning signal from that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, mass of data. You'll actually collect where areas of things went right or wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And you'll say, hey, turns out we hallucinated on this. It's because our rag strategy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is off or the agent is off, for example. You'll also annotate data sets as well, just to double check</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that those evals are correct. And then, of course, you always come back into your platform and you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you update the prompt template, right? You change the model because it wasn't good enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or you update the agent orchestration. So everybody understands that left-hand circle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, a lot of people actually forget about the right-hand circle. And so it turns out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the first time you run evals, what you'll quickly realize is that they're not perfect, right? You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually have to tune those evals over time. So the way you collect signal actually adjusts as your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">application also, you know, gets better. And so what I mean by that is that process of running evals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what you might notice if you annotate some of them is that the eval said something hallucinated or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't correct, and it actually was, or vice versa. So what you actually need to do is collect a set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">those failures, right? Say, hey, this is where the eval was wrong. And you'll know that by annotating some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">data every now and again. And then you'll want to improve the eval prompt template, right? Because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">way you collect signal at first, you'll quickly realize it's either too obscure, too vague, not specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">enough. So these are the kind of two virtuous cycles that you really want to get through very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way I describe it to AI engineering teams is, if you want to build like a quality AI product,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think about velocity. So the faster you iterate through stuff, if I can get through four iterations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in a month rather than two, you're going to exponentially have a better AI product as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">build. And so when we talk about architectures and things like that, when the industry first started,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this was state-of-the-art routers, right? Am I right? So routers are made up of like components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a really dumb example of booking.com's trip planner. So booking, you know, they're one of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">largest customers. Trip planner is basically a travel agent in LLM form. It drives revenue for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">company. It helps you book, you know, it'll book your flights, your hotels. It'll give you an itinerary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, when we think about evals, evals can be as complex as the application itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So in kind of older architectures, where there's things like routing, you can eval individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">components. I think most people get this when you're looking inside of a trace, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I want to eval a specific component or trace. So this one LLM call, right? But remember... Oops,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll come up here. But remember that you can, okay, remember that you can zoom out too. So it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have to just be this one specific component. Let's say this one component is part of an agent or a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow. Maybe I just want to evaluate the input output of that larger workflow. So that larger workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is made up of LLM calls, API calls, right? I have to find actual flights, actual hotels that have vacancy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe some heuristics. And then you can zoom out a little bit more. Maybe you want to eval things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the way control flow happens. It's a really important component. If you have components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in your AI agents that have control flow in them, it actually makes way more sense to eval your control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">flow first. And you have conditional evals, meaning if you didn't get the control flow right, why eval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">anything down the line? Because it's probably wrong, right? So save yourself some money and some costs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can think about conditional evals as well. And then of course, we have things like people want to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">evals at the highest level. So imagine you have a back and forth. So we call this a session in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">platform. But the whole idea is, you know, a session is made up of a series of traces. So you can imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a back and forth between you and your agent. I just want to understand, hey, at any point was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">customer frustrated? Was the customer XYZ? So when you start to think about evals, there's no one-stop shop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If anybody says this is how you should do evals, and they never asked you about how your application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">works, you probably shouldn't trust them. Also, I have a hot take. And my hot take is that don't use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">out-of-the-box evals. If you get out-of-the-box, if you use out-of-the-box evals, you'll get out-of-the-box</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">results. So really customize them very heavily. It's something that we've learned really from some of the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">teams in the world. Okay, let me come here. Then you have complexity. This is our own architecture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for our AI co-pilot. We built an AI whose one purpose is to troubleshoot, observe, build evals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for your AI system. It obviously takes advantage of our platform. But, you know, the reason why we go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this route is take us forward five, ten years from now. Do you guys really think that you, a human,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to be the ones who are evaluating all these AI systems, like, mainly? What do you think would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actually take your place? It's probably going to be an AI that evaluates future AI. So this is our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">first iteration on this stuff. We're super excited about it. We, you know, it's been out for a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's getting better and better. But maybe I'll show you a little bit of the workflows that we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in our platform really quickly. Who here is working with agents? Okay, who here is interested in, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">agent evaluation? Okay, let's cover that then. Let's see. I'll show you. We'll show you how the industry is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">doing agent evals. So the agent evals, things get, like, way more complex, right? The calls are longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look at your traces, they're much longer. I'll actually show you our agent traces. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">one that kind of failed. But our agent trace kind of works like this. So Copilot works like this. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, based off what you say and where you're at in the platform, there's agents that kind of can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">things. And it has tools. Each agent has access to a set of tools that it's particularly good at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole idea is that, yes, we can see what each individual trace is doing, right? We can say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, what's happening in this particular area? We can look at the traces. But the reality of what people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">are actually asking in the space is not, is my AI agent good or bad? What they're actually asking is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the failure modes in which my agent fails, right? And so what I mean by that is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you can look at one individual trace in the graph view of it. But the reality is you want to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and discern the signal with your entirety of your AI agent. So what is the, like, what does the pathing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">look like across all of that particular AI agent's calls? So for instance, if it had access to 10 tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you want to answer questions like, how often did it call a specific tool, right? What were the evals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in a specific path? So in our agent graph, for example, it's framework agnostic. So whether you use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">land graph, whether you use crew AI, whether you use your hand rolled code, this is an agnostic way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to look at how an agent's pathing performs across the aggregate traces. And so this helps you understand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, if my agent that hits component one, then two, then three, my evals look great. But for some reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">when we hit component four, then two, then three, our evals are dropping. And the reason is why? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, it turns out component four had a dependency, right, on component three, and it needs that dependency in order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to perform. And so when you think about the complexity of agent evals, you need kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the ability to see across not one instantiation, but all of them. You need to understand the distribution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of what's happening. And so when we think about evals across agents, that's one way you can think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then maybe an easier way to kind of think about it too is trajectory. We're thinking about trajectory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">evals. So imagine for a second, you have this specific input, right? And the input is like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, find me these hotels at TripPlanner. And you know you should hit this component, then that component,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this other component. So in this case, it's like start agent, tool agent. You might have a golden data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">set, like very similar to how we have golden data sets for LLM as a judge, but this is for trajectories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I expect us to be able to hit at least three or four of these components, for example. So the reference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">trajectory is kind of mentioned, like I need to hit these components. Then you get to do two things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one of two things. Either one, you can pass in like, here's what we did, here's what we expected,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">into an LLM. And then an LLM can actually grade the trajectory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also just say, hey, did we explicitly hit these exact like trajectory strings? Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But you don't always need a ground truth for that. You can start to get creative here. You can say, hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, here's this process that I expected to hit. Does these nodes and the description of their nodes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">match the correct trajectory, for instance? And then maybe you could do things like, we're kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">playing around with this, but maybe here's the trajectory that I hit. Here's the possible paths that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are just possible. Did I do well in these specific areas, right? And you can pass in the pathing as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">series of like, nested key value pairs, for example. LLMs are pretty good at that. But we start to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about, you know, agent evals. You know, the eval space is already complex enough. And what we're seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is even more complexity. But hopefully that makes sense. I'll pause here. Hopefully that makes sense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but usually I like to make time for questions at the end to keep this pretty interactive. Hope that's okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">team. But any questions? Does this make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. No questions? Oh, yeah. Go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the evals you're talking about are kind of like after the fact, right? Is there a way that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">can use evals sort of like to flow as a pattern? Like that's clearly a hallucination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Incredible question. So a lot of people, so there's evals that can be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, some people call them offline or online. I like to say is like, is it in the path? Is it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">orchestration or out of orchestration? So for some people, there's a cost to in orchestration evals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and the cost is things like latency, right? Some people might call those a guardrail too. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, can I continue or not continue? And so there's pros and cons to everything. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">when it comes to guardrails, this is something I kind of coach my customers. The way to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">guardrails in general is you have system one. System one is your orchestration system. It's what you built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's your prompts. It's everything else. System two is your guardrail system, right? Guardrails are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">really nice because they mitigate risk, right? But there is a cost and the cost is maybe it's latency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in your user's experience. You can get around that by doing smart things like maybe embeddings guardrails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They're, you know, two orders of magnitude shorter. But a lot of people don't think about the other two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">cons here. The other con is complexity. Two systems is complex, especially when one system checks in with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the first. The third thing is that a lot of people mistake guardrails as, like, the thing that needs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to be adjusted. A lot of people will go to their guardrails first, like, oh, I need to adjust my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">guardrails. The reality is you need to adjust system one. That's the root cause, right? Your guardrails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are really there to protect you. And then maybe the last thing I'll say too is guardrails are not infallible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They kind of act like unit tests. They're for known knowns, right? Whereas observability plus evals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because the reality is you don't know the distribution of what you're going to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">until you get there, right? Ask anybody who's built in the LLM space. Their users are just crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's the difference. And I really caution people because people are like, oh, I need to fix my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">guardrail. No, no, go fix the prompt first and then worry about your guardrails. But yeah, inline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we call those inline evals. Some people call them guardrails. But really, do you do the evals in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">orchestration or outside of it? And so you can, there's pros and cons. So there's no right or wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">answer there. But good question. Yeah, so when we have a complex system that is typically taking a long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">time to run and we have timeouts in this. And I know you'll have something called a span that limits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of view we're taking to a complex agent. So if we have like a complex system that's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take time and then there's an asynchronous way, is there support to manage something like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and evolve across the whole system that we have? Oh, yeah. Amazing question. So who here has ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">heard of OTEL? Open telemetry. Okay, even less than, okay. One of the most important things to our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprise customers is being on open telemetry. So you know how I said LLM teams are being split into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">two? Well, it turns out LLM services are also being split across services. And so the idea is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">people want to understand. So maybe an asynchronous process in one service or one Docker container,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">or you know, one Docker or one Kubernetes pod. OTEL propagation is a great way to get around that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning you can have a process like application A sends data to my model router, right? And then that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">comes back to application A. Then application A hits application B for some reason. And then it comes back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to A. When you're actually creating those traces, you want to be able to see all that work, right? You don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">want to just instrument one particular thing. You want to see it across work across. And so OTEL is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">an incredible pattern for that. It's a solved problem. So that's why we at Arise two and a half years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">when this crazy time started for all of us, we made a bet to be OTEL first. And it's it's really paid off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so confidence scores on evals, right? Yeah, I think it depends where you're getting your eval. If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">eval, if it's from an auto-regressive model, companies like OpenAI have actually exposed the log</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">prob. So the log probability is pseudo like confidence of like, and since you're returning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">only one code token, and that token is like the eval label, log prob is a really good way for those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">auto-regressive models. If you're using things like small language models and coder-only models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they come with a probability of the classification. But really, yeah, it's tough. But you have a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of tools in your toolbox, and you generally use them together to discern where things go well or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not well. But log prob, if you're using a model provider that exposes the log prob, is a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">good way to start for auto-regressive models. Okay, last question, and then we're time up. Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, do you have anything in your plans, like going forward, like how to shorten the loop between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">customer feedback and automatically improving the props, and also having like, you know, the development team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">effort work at it? Oh, good question. Yeah, we want to automate in that area, definitely. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who here has heard of DSPY? All right, okay. If you didn't raise your hand on any of this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope you learned a bunch. DSPY obviously has something like MiPro. MiPro is an optimizer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you get like 30 inputs, 30 outputs, and then it basically creates less fragile prompts that span</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">across different models. Like, so it does, it works for OpenAI, and then it works for Gemini, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In terms of like auto-optimization, yeah, I think we have the ability to, or we're releasing the ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to run prompt optimization. So some people call it, we call it meta-prompting. But basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we feed it a dataset, we said, here's the input-output pairs, here's the evals on those things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and then where things failed and didn't fail. Look at the original prompts, look at this dataset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you give me a new prompt that fixes this dataset? Yeah, so we call that meta-prompting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's basically use an LLM to just automate, so you don't have to. Yeah, but good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But really appreciate the time. We're over at the booth. Feel free to come grab me if you want to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvXj9tnWAQ&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture or anything, but really nice to see you all.</span></div></div></body></html>
