It's really actually an assumption that we make and then we force onto all of our interactions. Cynics, for instance, will pay lots of attention to the worst things that a person does and think, "Aha, I have evidence for my case," and they'll ignore or explain away the better things that a person does.</p><p>In other words, they're thinking like a lawyer in the prosecution against humanity. Skepticism is different. Instead of having an assumption about people, skeptics want as much evidence as they can get. If cynicism is a lack of faith in humanity, skepticism is a lack of faith in our assumptions. Where cynics think like lawyers, skeptics think like scientists.</p><p>Because of that, they can adapt more to new situations. They're not naive. They can learn more and they can build stronger and better relationships.</p></div></div></body></html>
