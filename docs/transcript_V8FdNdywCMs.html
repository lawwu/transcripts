So I looked at what I thought was kind of the eight best offers, similar institutions, but also included SoFi, Chase, PNC, Bank of America. And the bonuses were similar, $200 to $900, but you only needed to deposit $1,000 to $15,000.</p><p>And so if you look, most of the time, the range was 90 to 120 days. The actual bonus APY was crazy. It was from 24 to 200%. And so the top bonus was Axios Bank, $500 for depositing $3,000 for just 30 days. So that's how you get to 200% return because you get $500 on $3,000, which is about 16% return in just 30 days.</p><p>So if you annualize that, multiply it by 12, it's just wild and way more APY than you'll get anywhere else. It did require that you have at least $1,500 of direct deposit.</p></div></div></body></html>
