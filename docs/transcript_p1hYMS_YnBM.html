I know it does not make people happy. And just because you've got hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars does not make for a healthy, flourishing, holistic life. Somebody always had a more beautiful girlfriend who was more famous.</p><p>Somebody always had a better car, a better plane. If I was with a group of people gambling $10,000 a hand at blackjack, somebody else was gambling 100,000 a hand. It was this insatiable lust for more, but there was no end point. I think looking back at that, there was never going to be enough.</p><p>And in fact, I still know people who are out at the clubs and they are now dating girls younger than their daughters. Just continually looking for more, looking for more, looking for those markers of success, knowing that somebody's always got a little bit more than you.</p></div></div></body></html>
