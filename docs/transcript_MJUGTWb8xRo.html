Predicting the next token well means that you understand the underlying reality that led to the creation of that token. In order to understand those statistics, to compress them, you need to understand what is it about the world that creates those statistics. And so then you say, okay, I have all those people.</p><p>What is it about people that creates their behaviors, their thoughts and their feelings and their ideas? All of those would be deduced from next token prediction. And I'd argue that this should make it possible to say, can you guess what you'd do if you took a person with this characteristic and that characteristic?</p><p>Like such a person doesn't exist. But because you're so good at predicting the next token, you should still be able to guess what that person would do, this hypothetical imaginary person is far greater mental ability than the rest of us.</p></div></div></body></html>
