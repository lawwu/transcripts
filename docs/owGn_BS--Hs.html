Maybe you can speak to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGn_BS--Hs&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because most people tell me driving is trivial and humans in fact are terrible at driving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGn_BS--Hs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is what people tell me.

So all we know is very clear that that goal, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGn_BS--Hs&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">endlessly complicated, but it's very constrained. So, and in the real world, far fewer constraints</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGn_BS--Hs&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and many more potential surprises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGn_BS--Hs&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's obvious because it's not always obvious to people, right?
