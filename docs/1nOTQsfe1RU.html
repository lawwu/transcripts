Day one, day zero, the analyst comes to your company, super smart,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">can do a bunch of things. Doesn't know a lot about your business yet. They start working with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They mess up somewhere. You tell them, no, that's not what you should have done. This is what I mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when I say this. It learns, learns, learns, learns. Now this analyst 10 years later is an experienced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">analyst in your company. They know everything about your business. Right? Let's make an AI like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">An AI that keeps improving, keeps learning as you use it more and more, as you course correct it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as you steer it. But assumption is your AI needs to be correctable, explainable, steerable, already accurate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in what it knows. Right? So let's see how you build such an AI. Right? So we're trying to replace this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">human part of the AI. Right? So that's what we have been trying to do with PromQL. It's like a day zero</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">smart analyst. Right? So we take a foundational LLM and that's the whatever LLM you bring. We make it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">create PromQL plans. PromQL is basically a domain specific language which can do three tasks. Data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieval, data compute aggregation, and semantics. And this is a deterministic domain language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And vanilla LLMs are incredible at generating. We don't have to fine tune them. Right? Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">within this DSL, I can ask the LLM to create this DSL whenever I ask the user to ask the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I can execute this DSL in a deterministic runtime. I do not involve the LLM in actual execution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">actual generation of an answer. Because if I let the LLM generate the answer, it's by default</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucinating. And I'm just hoping the hallucination is correct. That's how LLMs work. Right? So I'm saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">decouple it. Let the LLM generate the plan, and we will execute this plan in a deterministic runtime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And let it work on a distributed query engine, which will talk to the different data sources,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pull out data, do whatever composition was required inside that DSL, show the answer directly to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">user. Don't give it back to the LLM. Let's not do rag. Right? Let's not give the LLM data back to the LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and make it generate the answer. Right? That's what the PromQL design is. Let me show you PromQL</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">working in action. I have five minutes. So let's make this quick. Simple question. Who are my top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">five customers by revenue? You'll be like, any AI system can answer that question, dude. It's a simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">text to SQL question. Okay. So PromQL is like, first of all, it understands what revenue means. Revenue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">means your invoice items. Okay. Cool. I'll do the math. Execute the math. And here are your top five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">customers. Oops. Nope. I didn't notice we did not get any results. Right? That's what a smart analyst</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">does. In their first attempt, they realized they messed up somewhere. Okay. I see the issue now. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">looking for succeeded status, but the actual statuses are paid and pending. See, your data is messy. It did not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">know what was happening. Right? It figured that out. And now these are your top five based on the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">data that's under the hood. So that's possible. Let's run this query now. Okay? Find the unique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">customers we serve. The org-guided data is messed up, so we don't use that. Find unique orgs based on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">email domains of the individual users. Then find the org with the third highest revenue. I'll let it run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because it'll take time. Find the unique orgs based on the email domains of the individual users. Then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for the org with the third highest revenue, take a look at the latest 30 support tickets. So multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">database, then your Zendesk support system, including the comments on those tickets, then summarize each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ticket. Then use those summaries and extract their feelings towards our product. Create five categories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">from bad to great. And then tell me what is going well, what can be improved. And then issue up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">$5,000 to this orgs project as, like, credits with the highest usage, which means $5,000 if their feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is bad towards us and $1,000 if it's great towards us. And how do you think an AI can do this? Spread</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">across your databases, your SaaS application like Zendesk, your API, like, Stripe to issue the credits, stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. So they'll be cool. First, I'll get all the users, extract their email domains. See, this is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">analyst explaining their thought process.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">can tell them, no, this is not what I wanted you to do. Don't do step three. Instead of that, do these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">three steps instead. Right? I can, I can be in charge of my AI, but still every single time if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have to nudge my AI, the AI is going to learn. They will understand. Okay, that's what you wanted me to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">do.

Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, cool. I should have said, just show me intermediate results step by step. But anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOTQsfe1RU&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it says I'm about to issue $3,000 refund.
