How do you on the personal side, kind of manage your time and not get caught up in in kind of those small questions and focus on what's most important? This one, I've always been pretty good at.</p><p>I think I read the four hour work week. I think I read that like way too early, almost. I was like, I shall outsource everything. But I read that really early. And I've tried to live it. It's actually helped a ton. So I've had a VA since I made like my first 100K.</p><p>The second I hit 100K, I was like, hire a virtual assistant. And now I have a few virtual assistants. And then I have an assistant that manages the first virtual assistants. And then I have sort of my chief of staff who all of them report into. The key though, I think, in delegation is realizing that you can only really have, in my opinion, five, max 10 people report to you directly.</p></div></div></body></html>
