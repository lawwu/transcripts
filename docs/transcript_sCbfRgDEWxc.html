And one of the advantages of it having been a month is that I have in those weeks, intervening weeks done a lot of interviews about this book, which means I have some data.</p><p>In particular, I have some data about what ideas from this book seem to be catching people's attention. So what I want to do today is isolate what I think is the single most discussed suggestion from this book based on what interviewers want to talk to me about. It is a suggestion, a strategic suggestion that promises essentially right away to significantly reduce the sense that you're frantic and busy all the time, running on a treadmill of digital freneticism and yet getting very little actual accomplished during the workday.</p><p>It's a solution that overnight can make that problem significantly reduced in your life. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to look a little closer at this problem of digital busyness and get to the core of it. Why are we like this? Then I will give you the big suggestion from my book that's been discussed more than any other idea so far during my publicity tour.</p><p>And then I will talk about tactical suggestions for how to implement this idea in your actual work life. I'm going to break this into two parts. Tactical suggestions for implementing it as an individual, even if you have demanding bosses and clients who aren't on board and tactical suggestions for implementing this if you're a team, you can get even extra power if a team works together all on the same page.</p><p>All right, let's get into it. All right. So what's the problem that we're going to face here? This idea that you're frantic all day long, jumping from email to slack in and out of meetings all day, exhausted and yet feeling like very little is actually being accomplished on the projects that you need to do, that you're as busy as you've ever been.</p><p>And yet progress on your work has never been slower. Now, if we're going to solve this, we need to know why this problem has become worse. Now, as longtime listeners of this show know, I'm a technologist, I'm a computer science professor, I try to understand these issues through the lens of technology interacting with us, our society and cultures in unexpected ways.</p><p>And I think this is almost entirely an issue of a techno-human interaction. All right. So two things happened, both coincident with what I call the front office IT revolution, the arrival in the nineties of personal computers on the desk of knowledge workers, followed in the 2000s by networks and then wireless networks and mobile computing.</p><p>So the front office IT revolution, two things came along with this that created the sense of frantic busyness in which very little was getting done. One, I think this is probably the least reported. It ended specialization. Let me be a little bit more clear about this. We've forgotten about this because we're so used to it, but it's very important.</p><p>Pre-front office IT revolution, work tasks were more specialized. There was enough custom knowledge and tools and friction involved in doing most things in the office that we tended to specialize. Different support staff would work on different things. If you were an executive knowledge worker, you would be thinking more about strategy, for example, but you didn't type things and you weren't able to make flight reservations.</p><p>And certainly you couldn't put together slides for a presentation. You need a graphic department to do that. There was all sorts of different people that work together. Things were more specialized. Then the personal computer came along and he said, look, this is going to be a productivity miracle. And they were right in the very narrow sense that the personal computer took many of these things that were happening in the office and made them more efficient to do.</p><p>Typing is much easier on a word processor. Now really anyone can do it. You can fix mistakes. It's not you, when you're typing onto a typewriter paper, you really need to be good at typing. Otherwise you're going to be constantly whiting things out, compute. You could fix your mistakes on it.</p><p>You could format things yourself. You can build slides. You can do your own presentations. You can send your own communications. You can, you don't need voicemail. You don't need a secretary. You can send emails and wait for those emails to come in. We get intra-office intranets where now I can log time sheets and book travel and fill out compliance forms.</p><p>It made lots of things doable by everybody. So what happened with this revolution? We fired all the support staff and said, who's left? Just do everything now. So the amount of work possible for each individual left in knowledge work after the front office revolution skyrocketed. The sheer diversity of different things you might do during your days compared to like the Mad Men days of the 1960s to 2006 is vast, vastly increased.</p><p>All right. The second thing that happened coincident with the front office IT revolution is digital networking reduced the friction of trying to assign some of this work to someone else. So now there's a vastly larger pool of things people can be doing. It's no longer, hey, Don Draper, go build this ad campaign for Kodak and let us know when you're done.</p><p>Let's build this infinitely many smaller types of things we can ask people to do. Digital networks reduced the friction of actually assigning work. There is no social capital cost or minimal social capital costs when I'm just writing abstractly into a screen. Hey, Don, can you throw together some numbers for the Q2 report?</p><p>Send. I don't have to see your face. I don't have to see this as a transaction in which I'm asking for a valuable resource of you. I don't see this as a favor. It's an abstraction. Send. Boom. It's also much easier, right? As soon as I think of something, I could get it off my plate.</p><p>I can play obligation hot potato by just type, type, type, type, type, send, and I don't have to worry about it. In a pre-digital network era, it might be a while till I see you again. Maybe we have a meeting scheduled tomorrow. So I need some way of keeping track of what's on my plate and what needs to be done.</p><p>And once I'm more organized about things, I might actually start consolidating things and taking things off my plate or being smarter about how we organize our efforts. But in the digital network age, I don't have to do any of that because as soon as something appears into my cognitive world and becomes causing stress, I can get that hot potato out of my hands in seven seconds of typing.</p><p>And so we became less organized, less considered about tasks, and just started throwing them off left and right. So we put these two things together. The amount of possible work for a knowledge worker to do increased. The amount of possible work that was on the knowledge worker's plate increased.</p><p>We got overloaded. This then created, so this is not directly the problem we talked about, which is busyness, but it created that problem. And it created that problem because, of course, the reality of anything that you have committed to do, a project, a task, whatever size it is, is that it brings with it its own administrative overhead.</p><p>You have to talk about it, you have to collaborate about it, you have to gather materials for it. And in the age of the front office IT revolution, this administrative overhead became more disruptive and time-fracturing than ever before because it could be sending emails back and forth throughout the day.</p><p>This was one of the most attention-fracturing possible means of collaboration. Asynchronous back-and-forth conversations that require you to constantly be checking channels and inboxes so that you see the next message in time to reply. We also had the digital meeting revolution. It's never been easier to throw a meeting on people's calendars, to throw around invites.</p><p>The cost of setting up meetings really reduced. So now we're paying this administrative overhead on more things than ever before, and the impact of this administrative overhead is more invasive and intrusive than ever before. This is what has caused our current problem with frenetic busyness. Why we feel like we're answering messages and in meetings all day but getting very little done is because we have too many things on our plate, and each of these things is generating its own stream of time disruption that takes our time and attention but doesn't actually allow us to complete the thing.</p><p>It's just talking about the thing, and we end up with days totalized by collaboration and overhead with very little time left to actually accomplish work. We have to do it in the mornings. We have to do it in the late evenings. This is not just inefficient, as I like to say during my interviews for slow productivity.</p><p>It's downright deranging. So digital front office IT revolution causes the problem. What is my idea? What is the idea that comes up more often than any other when we talk about this book on podcasts and radio interviews for solving this problem? Well, now that we understand it, we know what the solutions will be.</p><p>How do you solve busyness? You don't, as many people suggest, try to go after the symptoms and say, "We're going to have rules to try to put moats around, protect us from the busyness and this administrative overhead." Better expectations on email. Don't expect a reply right away, so that way you can batch your emails.</p><p>No meetings on a certain day of the week, and that way you can have a day free of the meetings. You have an instinct to treat the symptoms, but this doesn't work because this administrative overhead is actually needed. You've agreed to these projects. This is how these projects make progress, and if you're not able to be involved in the conversations and have the meetings and the emails, things stall, and it's a problem.</p><p>So these type of treating the symptoms approaches don't work. We need to treat the actual underlying problem, and here there's no shortcut to the solution of reducing the number of things creating administrative overhead. That is how you solve the problem of frantic deranging busyness. Have less things generating administrative overhead.</p><p>It's less about taming the administrative overhead generated by a single project than it is having fewer projects generating the overhead itself. Hey there, I want to take a quick moment to tell you about my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout. If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel, you're really going to like this book.</p><p>It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy combined with step-by-step instructions for putting it into action. So to find out more about the book, check out calnewport.com/slow. Everything you need, you can find there. All right, thanks. Let's get back to it. Now, of course, the radical way to do this would just say, like, I work on two things.</p><p>That's it. And just say no to everything else. The problem is very few of us can do that. You have to be very high up or very autonomous in your work. You know, I'm a novelist. No, I'm just writing my next novel. Get out of my face. They can do that.</p><p>Almost no one else can. So this brings me back to the idea then. So what is my strategy if the solution is going to be reducing the number of things generating administrative overhead, but we can't just say no to most things? What is the slow productivity solution that could actually work?</p><p>All right, here it is. It's pretty straightforward. You have two statuses for work that you've agreed to. So let's just imagine a list of things you've said yes to. There's two statuses, active, waiting. The projects labeled active, you're actively working on. They can happily generate administrative overhead and you will pay that administrative overhead.</p><p>People can send you emails about it. You can set up standing meetings to talk about it. You're actively working on it. Everything else, the projects that are labeled waiting, do not generate administrative overhead. They are waiting for their turn in your active spot. And as soon as you finish a project that you're actively working on, you pull something new from that waiting list into your collection of active projects and now we can talk about it.</p><p>But if it's in the waiting thing, no, we're not working on those yet. These are over here. We're waiting for it to come. Now for this to work, you have to be very clear about this, right? So as we get into the details of how to implement this two status workload management system, it doesn't work unless everyone knows what you're up to.</p><p>So you have to be super transparent. Here are my list. Here's how I work. Here is your thing. It's here. It's in position six on the waiting list. You can watch it. You have to have extreme clarity for the people involved so they know when to start doing administrative overhead with you.</p><p>And more importantly, you've assured them, I have not forgotten about your thing. Your thing is on this list and you can check as much as you want and watch it march towards active and when it gets to active, I'm going to execute it. You don't have to worry. This has been forgotten.</p><p>And that's, what's going to be important here. That clarity is going to solve the problem that they really have, which is, I don't want to have to worry about this task. All right. So this is what we're going to need. True statuses, clarity for everyone involved about the status of what you're doing.</p><p>This can make a huge difference essentially right away. Think about why, right? I mean, if you take the amount of administrative overhead you're paying from, let's say, ten projects and collapse it to three, that's a factor of three or greater decrease in the amount of emails you have to send and meetings you have to attend, a factor of three or greater increase in the amount of time you have to actually work on projects.</p><p>Now you can start getting things done fast. You can do them at a high level of quality. You're accomplishing more than you ever have before, but it's going to feel much better. All right. So how do we actually implement this? Well, let's start about talking about how we might do this as an individual, just doing this on your own.</p><p>All right. As I talked about first, there has to be clarity. So you need a shared document or Trello board or whatever tool you want to use that is shared. So you can point people right away. Okay. This is where your project is. Watch it march up to queue.</p><p>So what I like about using a Trello board for this is you can have a Trello column for actively working on, and you have a Trello column for queue of projects I'm waiting to execute. And this is an ordered queue. The thing at the top is the next thing you're going to pull in when you finish an active project and the thing behind right below it, that's the thing after that you're going to pull it.</p><p>So this is an actual ordered queue. Then you can have a column for a back burner, right? And what this is for is like a boss or a peer is like, "Hey, we should really think about doing blah." And you know, we're not really ready to work on blah.</p><p>And they don't really want you yet to do it. They just sort of had the idea and you need to give them the respect if I'm taking it seriously. So you need a place to put that, but that's not a queue that things are being pulled off of. It's just a stake in the ground, as David Allen would say.</p><p>You could do this with a shared document too, just three headings. Why I like Trello is you can flip those digital cards over and add information to it and attach files to it. So now you have a place because it's all shared for whoever assigned you this work. You can add the stuff they send you about it.</p><p>You can add it to that card. They can go directly and add stuff to that card as well as they think up like, "Hey, I want you to remember this or when we get to this, let's not forget this." You have a place for that to go. And I have to emphasize this.</p><p>This is like the key point I have to emphasize about the interpersonal dynamics of this suggestion I'm talking about. You have to know what game you're playing when you're working at one of these knowledge work jobs. The game you're playing, like what it is that your colleagues and bosses wants from you.</p><p>It's not what they want is fast email responses. That's not the game you're playing. That's not the problem you're solving for them. Their problem is not how do I get responses to my emails right away? How do I get people in the meetings as soon as possible? That's not the actual problem they have.</p><p>The problem you can solve for them is, "I have this thing that it needs to get done. I can't do it myself and I don't want to be stressed about it. I want this off my plate in a way that I can trust it's going to be taken care of." That's the problem you're solving for other people.</p><p>So when they can see, "Here it is, it's in Cal's column and it's in position three," you're solving that problem for them. More importantly, when they think of something else, "Hey, remember this thing we're going to do? I just have three more examples. I asked you to update the website with client testimonials," you put it in your queue of things that are waiting.</p><p>"Oh, you know what? I just got a testimonial from another client. We should make sure we put this in here," or, "Here's another idea I had." When you're using something like a Trello card, you can receive that information and say, "Great, I've just added it to the card," and they can see all this stuff is being attached to this card, the files, the text, the links, and here's the information.</p><p>It's all building up here, and this project is moving up this queue of things that Cal's going to work on next, and all the information is there. You're solving the problem for your colleagues or clients of, "I don't have to worry about this." So having a place where not only they can see their work is waiting to get done, but a place to put all their thoughts about their work, the files, the notes.</p><p>You can tell them to do that directly, or if they send it to you, you can just add it to a card. That's not a big deal to add information to a card. If it's your boss, you should do that for them. None of this is a big deal.</p><p>They're happy that this is being taken care of. You have this transparency. Now what you have to do is work really hard on the things that are in the active list, and you have to let people know when you pull a new project into the active list. This is critical.</p><p>You've got to email whoever is involved in that, whoever assigned it to you, whoever else you're working on, and say, "Hey, I'm actively working on this now. It's on my active list link. I'm all in on this. Let's rock and roll. Let's meet. Email me." All the stuff that is kind of annoying, it's not so annoying to me anymore because this is just one of three projects I'm going.</p><p>Let's go. Let's kick it off. Let's have a meeting. Let's have a brainstorm. Let's figure out a plan. I have a lot of time to dedicate to this." You just get that thing done. So you have to let people know. You got to actually do the things that are active and let people know when you're doing those things.</p><p>As people have gone through two or three of these cycles with you, they're like, "Okay, I get how this works. This is cool. Cal will let me know when my thing is active. If I think of thoughts and I send it to him, I know it'll be stored. I trust him.</p><p>When this thing gets active, he's going to let me know, and he's going to get after it, and this thing's going to get accomplished pretty quickly, and it's going to be accomplished well." So another thing that this is going to help you is this is going to allow you to avoid having to do these prioritization decisions in the moment of like, "Is this important or not?" Saying yes or no.</p><p>This is kind of the problem with a lot of minimalist approaches to workload management. It's basically so you have to say no more often. You have to say yes to fewer things, like, "What's the one thing you want to do? What's essential?" The problem with these approaches is that's like difficult decisions to make, especially when it's 4 p.m.</p><p>on a Friday and you're tired and your boss puts his head in the door and is like, "I need you to update the bulletin part of the website," or, "I think we need a better strategy," or, "We need to figure out if we should be using chat GPT." Whatever they're throwing at you.</p><p>It's really hard in the moment when you're exhausted. They're there. They want this from you. The pressure's on for you to do the calculation and say, "No, this is insufficiently important to the one thing I want to be working on." It's too difficult in the moment. This approach allows you to get around that because you can sort of soft commit to one of these things.</p><p>In the moment, it just goes onto your list. And now, when things are on your list, we can start talking about reprioritization and deaccessioning, actually taking things off the list. You can think now about priorities. When people bring you new things or they're asking you about something, you can talk to your boss or clients about, "How should we mess with the order of this list?" I think that's something you want to be doing a lot.</p><p>The waiting list. The column in Trello. "Hey, where do you want this? How urgent? Here's my list. It's either at the top or in the middle. Where do you think this should fall?" You get the stakeholders who are giving you this work involved. You're often doing this reprioritization. Now, what's going to happen here is that the things that kind of went on your list that weren't really that important, it was like in the moment, a brainstorm, or as things developed, it turned out to be less important than you thought.</p><p>They're just going to sort of stay at the bottom of the waiting list because things keep getting moved above them. So you need to be willing to reassession or deassession those things. Maybe move them diplomatically over to the back burner list, and then at some point maybe take them off that list altogether.</p><p>There's a good opportunity here to see what really is important. If you've been languishing on my waiting queue, it keeps getting moved down, things getting replaced, then we know that wasn't a right thing to be working on anyways. So you have to allow reprioritization, and you have to do these deassessioning.</p><p>This is what I would do as an individual. Again, there is some pain in doing this, but it's not as bad as you think. Blame me. Say it's a Cal Newport idea. But I'm telling you, the problem you're solving for your colleagues and clients is making their life easier.</p><p>Knowing you have this way of working, and it produces good results, and I don't have to keep track of things, I don't have to bother you, I don't have to remember things, I know how to deal with getting you work, and if I have ideas about that work that I can send it to you, and I can watch it get captured, eight times out of ten, this is going to fly.</p><p>Two times out of ten, it won't. Eight times out of ten, this will fly. And it will make your life, if it does fly as an individual, it's going to make your life so much better, because again, two or three projects worth of administrative overhead is cake. You can do all of the 1990s, 1980s-style productivity tips for figuring out the most urgent thing to work on, and the quadrants, and all that stuff works when you have three projects worth of administrative overhead.</p><p>Not when you have 13. Then you're just, ah, until blood comes out of your eyes. Three, you could do that. What about if you're on a team? How does this work if you're on a team and everyone's on board? Well, in this case, and this I detail in particular in the book, because there's a specific case study of a team doing this in the book, so I write about exactly how they do it.</p><p>You have on a wall somewhere, be this physical or virtual, post-it notes for all the project ideas or feature additions, or whatever your units of work is. You store them. Whenever something comes up, we should do this. We need to update the website. We need to add this feature to the software.</p><p>We need to gather a report of all of the statistics. Every time an idea for a project comes up for the team, it goes on a wall, be it real or virtual, in a big column that's for stuff we might do. So if someone has an idea, they have a place to put it where they know it won't be forgotten.</p><p>Two, you have another column in this wall for each of the people on the team. And when someone is working on something, you move that, be it physically or virtually, into their column. So you can see right away, what is everyone working on? You can also see right away, how much is everyone working on?</p><p>And again, you want this to be one or two things, maybe three, depending on what type of work you're doing. The final piece of this team-based two-status workload management is that you have a regular, efficient, highly-structured check-in meeting. You could do this in the morning or midday. It could be every day, would probably be good.</p><p>Maybe every other day, maybe Monday, Wednesday, Friday, where we check in on this wall. Okay, how is everything? What are you working on? I see it on the wall. How is that going? Do you need anything from anyone else? What's holding you back? Let's figure this all out right now.</p><p>We don't have to do a bunch of emails. You're going to need this information. You're going to need that. Okay, let's just write down. This is your document, like a log of each meeting. This is all in stone, right, so you can't get away with ignoring it. Okay, so like Dan, you want to get Laura.</p><p>She's going to need this information. When can you get it to her? You're going to do it by tonight. Okay, he's stuck because he's waiting for that. You figure out who needs what, fine. If someone is done with something, it is in these team meetings, you look at the big pile of stuff we could do, and you figure out as a team what things should this person work on next.</p><p>We're going to pull something new to their column. And this is how you handle work. So nothing gets lost. If you have an idea, it goes on the wall. You know what you're working on. You get what you need from people. As you finish things, more things come over.</p><p>People are churning through things pretty quick. But just like with our Trello list, one of the key things about this is you see languishing. This thing was on the wall for the last two months. We keep prioritizing other stuff over it. You know what? I don't think that was as important as it felt at the time.</p><p>Let's take it off the wall. And you get this deaccessioning based on your implicit aggregate priority decisions. So real teams use this, right? Real teams use this. They used to use Post-it Notes. If you're a software developer, this sounds familiar. This is a modification of a Kanban-style Agile methodology.</p><p>Yes, software developers are way ahead of the rest of us knowledge workers on this. So no, this is not an original idea, but you can adapt it to almost any type of knowledge work, which is the key idea I make in this book. All right. So what do we have in common here?</p><p>Having two statuses, whether we're in a team or an individual, having two statuses, actively working on, waiting to work on, a place for the waiting to be, a place to gather information about the waiting, transparency into what is where so we can have group reprioritizations and deaccession decisions will drastically improve your life.</p><p>Now, again, we want to get to the solution without getting to the core of the problem. And I'm just going to give this quick aside and then we'll move to questions. I'll give this quick aside. But this is one of the big problems we have, I think, dealing with some of the issues in digital knowledge work is that we don't go deep enough.</p><p>We look at the issue. Oh my God, I'm getting all these emails. And we just treat it at the symptom level and we like personify people are being bad. People have bad expectations and we see it as almost like a bad habit people have. We were just doing good work and then we have this arbitrary habit of sending each other lots of emails.</p><p>And so just tell people, knock it off. Don't send so many emails. I'm only going to answer them once a day. And of course, this fails, but when we understand the underlying problem, oh, I see. The front office IT revolution created these massive workload footprints and this fine grained ability to constantly be dealing with overhead for this massive workload footprint.</p><p>We have to reduce the overhead. We have to reduce the number of active projects we're working on. That gets to the real solution. Now you can slow down. You can slow down your day, even if you are sort of paradoxically accomplishing what you accomplish at a faster rate. So there's my big idea.</p><p>This come, we've been talking about this and I don't know, I'd say 75% of the interviews I've done for this book. This idea of the two status workload has come up as simple as practical. It gets to the core of an issue in digital era knowledge work. All right, what I want to do next is move on to some questions from you, my listeners about related issues.</p><p>But first, I want to give a brief word from our sponsors. In particular, this episode is sponsored by BetterHelp, and we talk a lot about the show on the show about how to construct a deeper life in this world of constant digital distractions.

When you access the internet, the websites or services that you're accessing are clearly listed on all of what are called packets, the little bundles of data that you send out onto the network itself.</p><p>Anyone looking at these little bundles of data can see what sites and services you're using. So if you're in public, let's say on a wireless Wi-Fi connection, anyone with a radio antenna can look at exactly what sites or services you're using. If you're at home, your internet service provider can look at exactly what sites and services you're using.</p><p>They can gather this data, they can sell this data to advertisers. And if you think they're not doing that, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn that I want to send to you. A VPN helps you avoid this privacy violation. Here's how a VPN works. Instead of talking directly to a site or service that you're interested in, your computer is instead going to encrypt the real message you want to send and send it to a VPN server.</p><p>The VPN server unencrypts it and then talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts the response and sends it back to you. So now anyone in the coffee shop listening to your Wi-Fi connection or your internet service provider, all they learn about your internet activity is that you're using a VPN and you're talking to a VPN.</p><p>They learn nothing about what sites or services you're going to. If you're going to use the VPN, the one I recommend is ExpressVPN. They have fantastic software, it's easy to use, you just turn it on and you use your apps and web browsers, just like normal. All this happens in the background.</p><p>They've got VPN servers all around the country and the world. So no matter where you are, there's probably one nearby to connect you to get that fastest connection. They have plenty of bandwidth as well. It's a seamless, quick experience. It's rated number one by CNET and TechRadar. It works on phones, laptops, you can even turn it on on your Wi-Fi router in your home, meaning that all devices connecting to your home network are now going to automatically have their traffic routed through a VPN.</p><p>Privacy for all in your house made easy.

All right, so that's what we have for our sponsors. Let's move on now to some questions.</p><p>I normally, Jesse reads these, so maybe I'll alter my voice for the questions. If Jesse was here, he would recommend I use my French accent for the questions, but I will not. I will resist. All right. Our first question comes from Jessica. Jessica says, I should start with the fact that I am neurodivergent and a very anxious person, which might answer part of the question, but I wonder how I can make myself stick to a simple productivity system instead of revamping everything pretty much every week.</p><p>I always feel like if I could just find the perfect system, it would fix everything. Well, Jessica, I don't think your concerns here are specifically due to neurodivergence or anxiety. They're common among people who get serious about how they organize their digital era knowledge work. Part of the problem is a lot of people put, I would say, too much faith in what their productivity system can accomplish for them.</p><p>But here's the thing, productivity systems, they cannot do your work for you. They cannot in themselves make you successful at your job. They certainly cannot fix everything. The world of digital knowledge work, what do productivity systems actually do? Two things. They can help you make consistent and smart decisions about what to work on.</p><p>So get you out of that, free you from that mode of reactivity of just, oh my God, something's due. Someone just emailed me. I'm just trying to answer these incoming pings and put out the rapidly growing fires. They can also help you avoid unnecessarily wasting your time and attention.</p><p>So I'm going to be more careful about how I deal with my brain. I don't want to context switch too much. I'm going to sort of build my scheduling and approach to work and my processes around one thing at a time, consolidating context switching, et cetera. So smart decisions, planning, and help you avoid unnecessary drags on your time and attention so you get more out of your brain.</p><p>And this is more of scheduling and processes. If you have ideas for both of those goals that are working for you, then you're getting most of the benefits a productivity system can get. Now if you tune up the system, it'll be useful, but it's not going to be night or day.</p><p>Night or day is having something in place, planning that's smart for making decisions and scheduling and process things in place to help you not waste unnecessary time and attention. Like going from zero to that is a huge win. Beyond that, it's like two users taste. It can kind of make a difference.</p><p>It's not going to be night or day. So if you have something in place for both of these, and given that you're a long-time listener of the show you do, you're getting 80% of the benefits. Now what about those other 20? Tune in once a quarter. Once a quarter, be like, "Hey, what's working?</p><p>What's not?" And make some tune-ups. Don't have high expectations, but you do want to check in semi-regularly because you want to prune things out of these two points that aren't really working or wasting your time. Or if there's a new type of challenge within these two points that has emerged that's not being addressed by your current systems or processes, you might want to tweak something or add something new.</p><p>And this will help, but I would see this more like the key thing is I'm going to use a horticultural metaphor here. The key thing is you plant a tree, the tree that yields the fruit of consistent smart decisions and unnecessary wasting of time and attention. That's the big deal is planting the tree, having the tree, having those fruits.</p><p>Now over time, you want to prune it. If you don't prune it, it's going to grow wild and maybe it's going to no longer produce any fruit. So you can't just put something in there and let that go for the next five years. But if you're just semi-regularly pruning this, a tree will keep growing and it'll keep delivering your fruits in some years better than others.</p><p>That's the way to think about this. Don't put so much on the details of your system. Yes, you need a system, but those are the two things that can do. It can't do your job for you. It can't make work easy. It can't be I start turning this crank and on the other end, I'm the president.</p><p>It's not the way it works. Work is hard. In the end, you still have to give concentrated cognitive effort to things that are difficult to produce things that are valuable. That's going to feel the same no matter what productivity system you have. That's going to be hard no matter what productivity system you have.</p><p>You basically just want to try to clear out some of the biggest obvious obstacles to doing that in a sustainable fashion. All right, our next question is from DK. DK writes, "I often have a large block at 90 to 120 minutes of time at the start of my day.</p><p>I want to use this time more efficiently, but it often gets eaten up by setting up the rest of the day. Even if I've completed a weekly and/or daily plan, I end up preparing for meetings, triaging my messages, or getting caught up on Slack threads. How can I be more effective at the start of my day?" Well, DK, I have three ideas for you.</p><p>One, prepare the day before for what you're going to do at the start of your day. Mark off that time like a meeting on your calendar, and have a set place you're going to go to do that work that's different than where you do Slack, that's different than where you think about your meeting prep.</p><p>Your day starts off not, "Okay, let's just rock and roll on all my channels and then get to work." No, your day starts off, "I'm going to my writing set, I'm going to the coffee shop, I'm doing my 20-minute thinking walk to get going, and I have everything right here to start working on this code, this memo, this business strategy, whatever, this big project." And it's scheduled, and that's what I do.</p><p>And you're going to be nervous about it. What if I'm missing things? What if in that first 90 minutes, really critical things happened, and you know what? It won't, and you'll be fine, and then you'll stop worrying about it. People can call you if it's urgent. They'll respect it like, "Yeah, I start with hard things, then I get after like meetings in Slack." They'll be fine.</p><p>And you'll be fine. So you just got to be more definitive about this. All right, second thing to suggest, do more preparation at shutdown instead of the beginning of the day. Over the last half hour of your day, and again, protect this on your calendar, let that be the time where you're preparing for the next day.</p><p>Shutting down open loops. Do I have what I need for these meetings? If not, let me schedule time before the meeting to do the prep. I like my plan for the day, okay. What am I doing to start the next day? Great. Let me gather all my materials. Great.</p><p>Schedule shutdown confirmed. Check the schedule shutdown box on my time block planner. Unload from work. Next day starts. You get right into the deep work you want to do in that day because you already went through all the process of looking at your next day. Do it the day before, not the morning of.</p><p>Third idea, do more meeting processing proximate to the meetings. I'm a big believer of when you schedule a meeting, scheduling time either before, after, or both. Time before to prep for that meeting, if you need that. Definitely time after, 15 to 30 minutes. Always add that to your calendar to process everything that just happened in that meeting.</p><p>All right, let me just stop for a second. What came out of this meeting? What decisions were made? What do I now need to do? What do I need to remember? Let me get that into my systems. Let me update what I need to update. I promised to contact these three people.</p><p>Let me contact those three people. Okay, good. I can now shut down that meeting. If you go straight from a meeting to something else, all of that post-meeting work just sticks around in your head and causes a problem. So meetings are not just the time you're talking to other people.</p><p>It's the time you're talking to other people and the time you need to make sense of that and prepare for it. If you do that on your calendar as well, then you'll feel more sort of in control of what's going on. But mainly, you just have to protect that time.</p><p>You don't want to be doing Slack and meeting prep during those first 90 minutes. Don't. Figure out a way to get that done without having to use your first 90 minutes. I think the benefit will be worth it. All right, my next question is from Skeptical Sally. This is someone talking about their partner.</p><p>That's always fun. Hi, Cal. My partner is a director of product management at a startup. And despite having risen through the ranks there, he has yet to be rid of a lot of the lower level work on his plate. He also has meetings all day, almost every day. Many things cannot be done without his input, but he is predictably exhausted all the time and has no time to do the thinking and writing work compounding the issues.</p><p>His most important work is to think so engineers can build the right thing. And he has no thinking time because of overhead and meeting happy colleagues. He claims there's nothing he can offload and he can't cancel meetings because too much won't move forward. But I don't buy it. All right, Sally, I don't buy it either.</p><p>I mean, here's what I do buy. And this is a common trap when people are dealing with overload and digital knowledge work. The common trap is to say, can I take work in the way I have it unfolding right now and just start not doing the things that I'm not liking?</p><p>Can I just start canceling meetings? He's like, well, no, because these are projects that I'm supervising and I have to supervise them and they need meetings. Or he's like, can I just, uh, can I radically reduce the projects? Well, for a lot of people that could be, yes, using the system I talked about in the deep dive of today's episode, you could have active projects and waiting projects.</p><p>Managers can't always do that though. It's like, no, these are the projects going on. I'm in charge of them, but not in charge of deciding what we do. And so, no, I can't offload projects. And then they throw up their hands, but what they don't think about is can I change the structure in which this work is actually happening?</p><p>Not changing what I'm doing, but changing how I'm doing it. And here we often get significant failures of imagination. So Sally, here's what I would tell your husband. Here's what you're going to do. Two and a half hours every afternoon, maybe three, it's going to be a 30 to 60 minute office hour block right there in your afternoon, your door is open, you have a Zooms or Teams turned on with a waiting room and your phone is on.</p><p>The rest of this time you have a Calendly, whatever type setup, 15 minute blocks, 15 or 30 minute blocks, you choose which is like 90 minutes to two hours of just boom, boom, boom. You can go in there and grab any block you want. Here now is how you deal with all of your teams.</p><p>Teams that just require an answer and they can be answered in a single message. Hey, what is my budget for this again? What is my timeline for this again? When is it? Have you heard back yet about whatever? Those can be emailed. Great use for email. They show up, they sit until your partner is ready to look at his emails and he can send back answers and get the information to people, minimal overhead.</p><p>Great. Things that require some back and forth. Come to my next office hours.</p></div></div></body></html>
