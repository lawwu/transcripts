We also know they're highly addicted and lead to sort of a terrible cycle. So all of a sudden comes along this innovator says, you know what?</p><p>I've got a new opioid and you know, it's safe. You don't have to worry about getting addicted from this one. It's magical. It won't work. And you know, a hundred years ago, that thing was called heroin. 200 years ago, that thing was called morphine. 300 years ago, that thing was called Maldonum, right?</p><p>We have these new drugs, which have come in and they've never been safe. But you know, in our case, it was OxyContin and you know, the magic of the time relief was supposed to make it, make it safe. And it wasn't safe. I, you know, I pushed back against the universal basic income advocates who I think are basically engaging in a materialist fallacy of thinking that a human being's life is shaped by their take on pay.</p><p>They feel quite dangerous to me because they feel like like they're going to play into rising joblessness in America, which feels like a path forward.</p></div></div></body></html>
