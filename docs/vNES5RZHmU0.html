Why do you think home cooking and restaurant cooking is so different?

And I jokingly say it's like learning how to drive an F1 race car, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's the same thing as a car, as a Prius, but very, very, very different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And as crazy as it sounds, I do think it's somewhat applicable because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how I would drive a race car is very different than I would drive at home.

They're just really not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">at all useful for the home cook.

And when you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cooking professionally, if you have friends that cook in restaurants on the line or something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you'll probably hear them say they never cook at home because they just are always too tired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last thing they want to do is spend all day cooking on their one day off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So you fast forward, I don't know, 15, 20 years later, I had never cooked at home. And almost in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">all of my apartments, I had paper plates or those plastic bundles of salt and pepper and soy sauce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and chopsticks and plastic, you know, forks and knives. Those were my utensils. And I never had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">anything. I never had a plate or cups until I started dating my now wife. She was like aghast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">at the fact that I didn't have anything to cook with or eat on. So literally, I never cooked at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">home. And then when my wife became pregnant with our first child, that's when I started to cook in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">earnest. And everything that I did was not how I would ever teach anybody else to cook. They were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">very, very, very, I would almost say inappropriate ways of cooking. Because it was almost perverse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing that allows me to do it is I understand food science, and understand technique,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can sort of reverse engineer how to get to the end goal of a dish, which ultimately is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">delicious. So long story cut short, I figured out a bunch of hacks that that worked for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and some of them work for other people as a home cook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I love it.

I don't have time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to cook.

Because we went from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we have no time.

So I have to wash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the knife, I have to wash the cutting board, I have to wash my hands multiple times, if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do it correctly. And now if I just do it in any day, I don't even have to wash my hands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because I've never touched chicken. I put the lid on, I cook it for about seven and a half minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's thawed out, but the center's still going to be raw. I could cook it all the way, but there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">no need. And so I'm taking frozen chicken. Usually if I have to defrost it, that's at least a day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but you know, how else are you going to defrost it? You have to like just leave it out. So I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">done that in seven and a half minutes to defrost it. Now I've chopped it up into bits. I've taken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the garlic and I've taken the shiitake mushrooms. I've added some, you know, momo soy sauce,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">some dark soy sauce, some agave, some neutral oil, and I'm just sautéing that, added some scallions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And as that's cooking, I added my chopped chicken and all the juices that accumulated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and pretty much sauté that for like a minute. And then I add the noodles that I cooked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, re-season and I'm ready to go. Put it back into any day and they're going to reheat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that for lunch. So again, is it pretty? Absolutely not. But I'm not like cooking for an audience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">other than my family. The final product looks delicious, tastes delicious, but you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it was a roundabout way of getting there, but it was extremely quick. I cooked that in 10 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, while the water was boiling, I microwaved the chicken. So to do a delicious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">dish in 10 minutes, I mean, it's hard to beat. Yeah, I've had a great experience. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'm going to talk with the team. So I'm just going to tell everyone listening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that by the time this comes out, hopefully if you go to allthehacks.com/anyday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll have hooked up a deal for everyone to check it out. But I have a couple of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there other things that are uncommon that you cook?

I think you've talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">about veggies.

Listen, I say lobster because that's the people go "What the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fuck?" But the reality is, if you just like eating vegetables, it's what you're going to use all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">time, every day. If you have kids, it's how I cook almost everything for my kids as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Vegetables work extremely well. Frozen vegetables work really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I make gravies in there. And I can make a one-pot mac and cheese from scratch faster than a box</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">mac and cheese that tastes way better. But my kids probably will still want to eat the box mac</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and cheese. And when you're making it, is it just throw in water, pasta,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">butter, cheese? You can throw it in or...? Well, yeah. A lot of it's again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just understanding the food science of it all. So, if I add water just to cover the macaroni</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or any pasta shape, and I add some salt, but not too much salt because the salt is going to reduce,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Because I'm going to evaporate most of the water away. I leave that uncovered for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">say, I put a cup and a half, two cups of pasta, cover it with water. So, it's barely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, maybe a couple of millimeters over the pasta itself. I'll pop it in the microwave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">uncovered for about nine to 10 minutes. I will take it out. That water now is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">concentrated with starch, right? So, it's going to be almost viscous. But I want to microwave it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to the point where most of that water has evaporated. There are some left. For the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">reason, when you make pastas, a lot of times you're adding at least a scoop or two of the pasta</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">water back into the sauce because of the starch that's now in the water. The pasta is now pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">seasoned because of the amount of salt that I put in. Now, all I need to do is make a roux, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Because to make a bechamel, because that's how you traditionally make macaroni and cheese.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You take flour, you take butter or some fat, and then you add milk to it. And you thicken that up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">turns it into a gravy more or less, and then you can mount it with cheese. And that's your cheese</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sauce.

So, I take, after nine to 10 minutes, I'm taking the pasta out. I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to throw a couple, maybe a tablespoon or two of butter right in there. I'm going to add a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tablespoon of flour. I'm going to add a little bit of milk, maybe like three or four tablespoons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to mix it up and I'm going to put it back in the microwave for about three minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to come back out.

I can even put the lid on and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">shake it up.

And now I can add in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">cheese and it's now ripping hot.

I could have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">added the cheese earlier, but all about, this is all about how do we save as much time as possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I can take the cheese, I can liaise it with the sauce and I can help like bring the temperature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">down.

I didn't use a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">double boiler.

Yeah, I have not gone as deep as I plan to. One thing I've always wondered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is the microwave something where you have to get the time right? And the way I'll ask the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">question is, is six minutes, stop it and start it again for one minute. Is that the same as running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it for seven minutes? Can you fine tune it or does it take a little bit of warm up each time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the microwave manufacturing divisions, they need to get their act together because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they're all working off of different platforms, more or less. So, almost every microwave,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">even if you buy it from, say, Panasonic or any of the big microwave producers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they change their wattage yearly sometimes for no time or reason. So, every microwave is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to be different. It really is crazy. You need to find the wattage and there's a lot of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things you can do to find that. But it's really getting to know your microwave. And the wattage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">really has a lot to do with the time. So, the things that are going to affect the microwave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are no different than, say, cooking turkey. If you put an eight-pound turkey in, it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">cook way faster than a 28-pound turkey. The laws of thermodynamics don't change in a microwave,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, if I put a huge piece of pork butt in that I'm trying to cook, it's going to take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">long time, right? No matter what the wattage is on the microwave, it's going to take a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, if we're cooking pasta and I'm trying to bring some water to a boil, a lot of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">depends on the power of the microwave. So, some microwaves won't be able to do that in seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes.

And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">other thing people don't use is the power levels of a microwave.

Not me. I can't. I end up making like, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">four things.

That's all I want. So I have been known to make quite a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">few things quickly for them. And I think they understand the power they wield over me now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would say, like, the one thing as a quick thing to try for your kids is a crepe. You make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">crepes for your kids? I don't think I've ever made a crepe for my kids. I've made it before kids,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but... All right. Well, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there's restaurant crepes, and then there's home cooking crepes. And most of the things I say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I cook at home, I would never cook it that way in a restaurant, right? In a restaurant, you need a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">specific shape and thickness and aesthetic. So you need one egg to one cup of milk to one cup of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">flour, basically. And you could add olive oil or some kind of butter, melted butter. And I put that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">into like a little blender. And that's it. Very, very quick. On a nonstick pan or black steel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2798" target="_blank">00:46:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you just pour a little bit over medium heat, and then that's it. So you want to get the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">thickness, but it doesn't matter. You know, you just want to get as thin as layer as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then now you can turn that into just about anything. I can turn that into sort of crepe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2812" target="_blank">00:46:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">pancakes. So it's not necessarily traditionally pancakes, but then I can sort of roll them up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like they're crepe Suzette or something like that. And then just what I'm trying to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">something that is like a crepe is constantly change the shape and form of it so it looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2827" target="_blank">00:47:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's different to them and put different feelings in. So if it's a crepe, then I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">get it more crunchy on the bottom. I can get it super crisp, like it's almost like a tortilla,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can put cheese and ham and I could turn that into like a crepe quesadilla like thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2846" target="_blank">00:47:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I could even crack a scrambled egg in there, put some cheese and some bacon and roll that up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it gives me a lot of flexibility. And I found that if you are sort of stuck in your ways of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">presenting something to a child, then you're going to be limited. And I think being able to tweak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">things on a daily basis prevents them from getting bored from eating. So the crepe is the only thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">left in my pitching arsenal that they still can't hit.

Because if you follow recipes, and I see this a lot, like if I post</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">something, or I make something, someone's like, oh, how'd you make that?

Finding what's best is sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ridiculous. And I know that's easy to sell and easy to explain. But for example, if you go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Tokyo, and you go to any of the, like the really sushi expert aficionados, right, that I know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">if you say, Hey, I want to go to the best sushi restaurant, they're going to erase you from their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">phone. Because it's like, you're just a dumb ass to them. It's so overreductive. I think what they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">want to say is like, do you understand the nuance and understand that at given any given moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there might be like five to seven serving the best stuff that night. So a lot of it is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the feeling the price range, right? And I think doing the homework never hurts. But the best thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is just to go out there and do it yourself. And I think the hard thing clearly is ever, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">know, people are on a budget, and they can't go eat out all the time. So I think at that degree,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it really doesn't hurt to go to the places that are like tried and true, right? So like, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3213" target="_blank">00:53:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">example, in New York, if people were saying, Hey, where do I go, my parents are there, my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">grandparents are coming, and like, it's a good celebration for like eight of us. And they really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">want to like blow it out, I'd say like, go to go to a little Bernadette, or even if it's a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">little Bernadette. Because like, it's the kind of restaurant that make everyone happy. And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">delicious. And it's not like a four hour tasting menu. You know, if my my friend who I know likes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to spend a lot of their disposable income on high end restaurants, and I know that like they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">coming to town and they want something, I'm just like, Okay, I got a table at Brooklyn Fair, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I mean, like, each restaurant probably has a purpose, right? Some are catchalls. Some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">are specific. If I was in San Francisco, it's like, okay, like, we'll think about Corey Lee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the great chef, my good friend, he has been new and he has sent home on the Korean barbecue spot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3272" target="_blank">00:54:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">One is for specific occasion for dining. Dining is very different than eating. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Dining is feeding your brain simultaneously. And eating is San Juan, which is delicious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and everyone gets it. So again, part of it is understanding and reading the room. I think before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you even figure out where to go is like, Who am I eating with? And like, what, what is the desired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">result? And if you're thinking like, hey, I just want to check the box, I want to go to three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mission star restaurant. Then like the mission guide isn't always the best indicator, but it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">gives you a sense of what is there. And even all those lists give you a sense of where to go and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what to eat. But at the end of the day, I think going in the chat rooms, just reading everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">possible. Instagram is a great, great feed. Like if you find the gourmands out there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3323" target="_blank">00:55:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">if you follow them, like little Megan Japan is a perfect example. I think she's one of the great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">connoisseurs of food in the world. She where she eats is the good shit. You know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what we have right now. Don't we live in a world where you have instant information to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3342" target="_blank">00:55:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a degree. And you have people that are doing the work for you, you just got to find those people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3347" target="_blank">00:55:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">first. So I before even going online, I would probably find the people that like you follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that you might like, you get a sense of, oh, if they like something, I might like something too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're almost like a proxy. So that's another recommendation that I would follow people online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. One tactic I've always used is find a restaurant that you like, that you have liked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3369" target="_blank">00:56:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, for five, 10 years, they go look it up online. And invariably, there's probably a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3373" target="_blank">00:56:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">restaurant you like that's like a three star restaurant. You're like, Whoa, this is it breaks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your brain because you just assume that a three star restaurant on Yelp might be bad. And it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3383" target="_blank">00:56:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">changed my perspective. I was like, Oh, I actually like this restaurant. The internet says it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a great restaurant. So maybe I don't always have to trust the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yeah. Again, I'm looking for the either or numbers, right? If it's a three star restaurant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where every review is a three, that's probably not for me. I'm looking for, wow, you either love it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or hate it. Yeah. You know, when I was doing some homework, I was looking at you got a show coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3408" target="_blank">00:56:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">out on Hulu. And you mentioned people you could cook with anything. And I've watched this one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">scene in it where someone's cooking with like a closed steamer. So talk a little bit about Secret</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3417" target="_blank">00:56:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Chef because, you know, I didn't I didn't get a preview. I didn't get to watch it. But it looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty interesting. This was a show that we were working on for a while. So I was excited. I can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">believe of all the pitches that we made for Hulu that they actually said yes to this one, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3432" target="_blank">00:57:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it was the most insane one. It was also going to be the one that was a big budget and we were going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to need a giant soundstage. So we shot it down in Atlanta where like they shoot Marvel films,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3441" target="_blank">00:57:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">everything like these huge airport hangers. And we built this crazy set up where the contestants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">never saw each other, you know, while they were cooking without revealing too much. And then as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the challenges happen, what we wanted to do was make it where it was a game. It wasn't just about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3459" target="_blank">00:57:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the food. The food was a vehicle for the contestants to play a game. So it was different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3467" target="_blank">00:57:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of strategy and different elements that I don't think you've ever seen in a food reality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3472" target="_blank">00:57:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">show thing. And I was excited about the challenges we put them in because I think they're very fresh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3481" target="_blank">00:58:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and there are things that you've definitely not seen on camera. And if you haven't seen it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3486" target="_blank">00:58:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't even know what I'm embargoed to say or not to say. So I'm going to err on the side of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">being conservative here because I don't want to get Disney upset. But in one of those challenges,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3497" target="_blank">00:58:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say that we gave everybody household products, right? Or not products, things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you would not normally cook with to make a meal out of. And one of which was a clothing steamer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3514" target="_blank">00:58:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were supposed to cook something beautiful with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNES5RZHmU0&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw that in the trailer, but I don't know what they came up with.
