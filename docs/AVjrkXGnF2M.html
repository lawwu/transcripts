And our team itself is focused on exploring what the future of customer engagement is going to look like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with an eye towards emerging technologies like AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're not the AI team within Twilio. At Twilio, we sort of see AI as a feature that spreads across all of our products to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to help engage customers to better. It helps our customers to better engage with their customers. And you might have seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of our like customer AI billboards around that is really sort of the vision around that is how do we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">use AI to better empower people to engage with their customers. So we have innovation in the name though. So are we the only ones</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">innovating at Twilio then? The answer is also no. Generally, it's everyone's job to innovate. But I think there's two types of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">innovation. If you've read the innovators dilemma, this seems familiar to you. But basically, there's sort of the sustaining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">innovation and the disruptive innovation. Sustaining innovation is really teams trying to innovate on top of their existing products and their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">existing customer needs. That is sort of often more the iterative one. It's like Sony trying to make a mirrorless camera better and like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">really innovating in that space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">While disruptive innovation is often initially in its infinite stage much worse in quality. It's actually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">characteristic of disruptive innovation is the poor quality that often does meet the need of a niche audience though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So think about cell phone cameras when they initially came out. Nobody would leave their camera at home, go on vacation and be like I'm gonna take pictures on this like Motorola.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But these days like most people don't even have a camera anymore. Like I just went on vacation and only took my phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The exciting thing about AI is that innovation is really happening on both ends of the spectrum. We see both sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">augmentation of existing workflows like, you know, Photoshop's generative fill. A lot of what Apple announced was baked into existing products, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't a, hey, here's a new AI thing. But it was more built into the features. So that's more on the sustaining innovation side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">While I would say agents, especially in GPT's in general, are more on the disruptive side. Because the reality is agents are not ready for enterprise prime time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Primarily because the quality is not there yet, right? Like we've, we've all seen sort of agents going rogue, partially even rag based chatbots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like not even agents like, you know, hallucinating things like the example of selling, you know, Chevy Tahoe for a dollar or, you know, Air Canada's chatbot making up a policy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so because of all of that and overall the lack of clarity in the regulatory space, often within enterprises, the adoption right now is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">dictated by legal more than product teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so overall we're seeing sort of a lack of, like it's not ready for the prime time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The other aspect of it is for a live enterprise, they see AI as a cost saving method and agents are not cheap yet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we can do increasingly better like rag based chatbots for low cost, but like agents are still not in the cheap level if you want high quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they're at odds there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The difference though is for startups and SMBs, they're really your niche these days where for them, they actually see agents as a way, as a value add, not as a cost saving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They already know that their quality of customer support and sales and stuff is not where you want it to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for them, it's much more an opportunity to really add value because, you know, it can't be worse than the current experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So why am I talking about the difference between these two types of innovation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very natural for a business actually to focus on sustaining innovation, especially if you're the incumbent in the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's you already have an established customer base, they're already paying you, so that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The problems are well defined and so overall, it's much more predictable and you can you hopefully understand your target customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">While for disruptive innovation, it's sort of really the opposite and you don't know yet what it's going to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And like you often are not going to make money initially, but ignoring disruptive innovation right now can be more dangerous than ever before because the biggest difference between sustaining and disruptive innovation is the quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And the quality changes every day, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like every day right now with AI, there's massive leaps and so something that wasn't quite there from a quality perspective yesterday can be there tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And in a similar way, a company that is not your concern yesterday can be tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the best example of this is the impact that ChatGPT and perplexity and similar things had on how Google approaches search, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we have AI overview and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so our team right now is focused on this disruptive innovation aspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's sort of where our innovation perspective comes from is we want to understand what is going to be disruptive to Twilio and how do we prepare for that, react quickly, or be the disruptors in the space and inform the rest of the company about our learnings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But that wasn't our original agenda, our original agenda was we were founded as a three person Skunk Works team last year that was really focused on special projects and trying to rapidly prototype the bridge between our customer engagement, like our customer data platform and our communications platform to create this customer engagement flywheel that I was talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And to do this in a way of quickly, quickly prototyping solutions, showing them to customers, getting feedback, understanding what is their vision, where are they going to go, not just their current problems, and then iterate on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So we found Gen.AI was actually a natural fit for us because the biggest thing about customer engagement is you're sort of sitting between unstructured communications data and structured customer data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And nobody wants to chat with a JSON object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And like your unstructured data is not very helpful for analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And really large language models are perfect to bridge this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They're great at creating this connection and translating structure to unstructured and vice versa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as a result, we dove into prototyping our first two solutions in that space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what got us into the AI space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We had conceptualized essentially two features that we showed to customers, iterated on, and ultimately handed off to R&D to take to market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">One of them was the AI personalization engine, which is a rag on top of this customer profile that is within segment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the AI perception engine that was more focused on how do you take communications data and then translate that into a customer profile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Because within a conversation, there's so much rich information that you want to remember about a customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes a human agent will take notes somewhere, but I realistically want to have one central spot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we conceptualized these two systems and sort of together they make this customer memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But as we showed them to leadership and they handed them over to R&D, we did hit our first challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was that we had conceptualized something that wasn't sustaining innovation, was disruptive innovation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a problem where the quality was not quite there, the cost was not quite there, and primarily we were solving a niche use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what we had made up was primarily helpful for this up-and-coming wave of agents and generative AI solutions in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But there wasn't a large market for this yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so even though we had great feedback, we didn't really have the momentum that helped us to prioritize this among the sustaining innovation and profitability focus that our R&D teams had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we learned from that that even though our customer obsession was key, because it helped us understand that we were on the right track, we knew from talking to them that this wasn't just a problem they were trying to solve today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a problem that they were going to solve tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What wasn't working was we had to build ideas out further to be able to gain that traction and be able to hand it over to R&D.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we started working on our next project called AI Assistance, which is an agent builder that is built on top of this customer memory concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's designed to really allow you to build omnichannel customer engagement chatbots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we started with the same principles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We tried to really rapidly prototype, quickly get something into the-- like to show to customers, get feedback, get a working demo, continue to iterate on it as we're getting feedback both internally and externally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we did a couple of things differently this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">One, we decided we have to get this into the hands of people as soon as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What we had built previously was primarily demo driven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It was what can we show to customers and get feedback based on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we changed our mode and ran internal hackathons, tried to give it-- give really rough-- access to really rough prototypes with all the rough edges to customers coming into the office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're like, here's for one day you have access to this prototype.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Let us know everything that is wrong with it and what you wanted to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was both terrifying and incredibly insightful for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And additionally, we tried to find more opportunities to do dogfooding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We tried to find ways we can solve problems internally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We started with a low-risk use case around IT help desk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We knew it wasn't the perfect target customer that we would expect to buy our solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was a way for us to gather data and see what the quality challenges were and how we wanted to structure things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we started to establish an engineering organization that would actually be able to set the foundation for us to actually take this into the hands of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But that brought us to the next challenge because at Twilio we've worked hard over the last couple of years to really build the foundation to--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in our software development lifecycle to really create trust with customers in what we're launching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And Gen.AI really changed how you develop AI products, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually exciting but also tricky for larger companies because Gen.AI turned sort of the entire product development lifecycle on its head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Where in the past you had to gather a lot of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You had to make sure you had enough data to train a model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You trained the model until you reached a certain level of quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you released it and then you started optimizing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">These days you can actually use Gen.AI to build a prototype or often an MVP very rapidly without having that data and release it out to some customers to get feedback and then continue to iterate on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But that puts us into a dilemma because we have a system now that we know is not quite there from a quality perspective but we need to get it in front of people to make it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so how do we do that and how do we keep up with the pace of technology without really upsetting customers with something that doesn't meet our normal quality bar?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's why we looked around the industry for other examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The two that came up for us were GitHub Next, the creators of GitHub Copilot and then Cloud for Emerging Technologies and Incubation that created things like workers and D1 and workers AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And both of these were really focused on setting the appropriate expectations for users around reliability, capabilities, and availability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Our solution for this was to create our own sub brand called Twilio Alpha that was very focused on setting the right expectations with customers but enabling us, therefore, to ship early and ship often, engage the interest from customers outside of those that we would have to otherwise track down and enable customers to come to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's learning number two to ship early and ship often so that we can regularly get rapid feedback from customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.160</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">As we started hiring people, we focused on curiosity and creativity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because at Twilio, we've always valued the creativity of developers to solve not just coding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but business problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, our co-founder, Jeff Lawson, wrote a whole book, Ask Your Developer About It.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for us, having natural curiosity within the team was more important than existing AI experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we wanted everyone to be able to solve problems rather than relying on product to figure out what is the thing we're building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We wanted to give problems to the engineers and be able to figure out what we're going to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing we put in place is flexibility, both in terms of our systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We assume that every model that we're using is going to be redundant tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't mean that we're jumping on every model that comes out in every paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But instead, we understand what are our known limitations and how do we --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And every time a model comes out, how do we quickly validate whether the next model is something that helps us in that moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, when 3.5 Sonic came out, we were able to figure out within a day whether we wanted to pay any attention to this for now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or whether we're putting it in a backlog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The other side is flexibility of roadmap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Having a new team that is specifically focused on innovation helped us not have any pre-existing commitments to customers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and allowed us to really have flexibility about the roadmap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we try to defend this flexibility as much as we can with current initiatives around this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The big part around this I would recommend is to understand that expectations are shifting at any moment currently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning figure out what are expectations that are staying because those are worth putting on the roadmap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Those that are ever-changing, you need to have more flexibility around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about the difference between trust and safety where people are always going to be focused on versus multi-modality where every time some new mode comes out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">people are going to change what they want to have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people don't talk about image these days anymore, but that was the hot thing a few months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now everyone talks about voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you will constantly have to iterate on your roadmap and you have to be okay with failures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're okay with failures, especially in the environment right now where everyone in the company and most companies has to provide value at all times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you provide that value while you're waiting for your eventual home run?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where we made the last mistake that I want to call out where, as I mentioned, our team is self-contained within the company, including having our own go-to-market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the first year, we took that self-containment a bit too far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We basically just operate in our own corner quietly and shared what we were working on on a need-to-know basis, both with customers but also internally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that resulted in often teams not even knowing that we existed as a team or what we were working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was on us to find potential conflicts or collaboration opportunities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the same time, our customers were having the same questions that we had around what are we doing about AI, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it really, especially for a B2B company, you have the opportunity to help your customers be thought leaders in their space and build a stronger bond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So our third learning was to share things as we go, both internally and externally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Internally to find opportunities to share all that enormous learnings, the enormous learnings that we had with others to empower them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but also externally to enable others to be thought leaders in their space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are our biggest learnings from the last year, and we actually ended up turning them into our base principles for the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So being customer and developer obsessed to make sure that we talk to customers early and often and understand not just their current problems and their current problems with Twilio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but understand their business, their challenges in general, and their vision for customer engagement so that we can anticipate their future needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Shipping early and often so that we can set the right expectations with them, but still get things into their hands and get feedback from them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And creating a team that is curious and owns problems so that we can actually build things quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then lastly, share as we go, that we're both sharing internally as much as we can, but also sharing externally to help our customers be thought leaders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And with that, thank you so much for your attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The slides are already on that URL if you want to check them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">As Peter mentioned, I will have to run to the Twilio booth to raffle away of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But if people do have questions, please come to the Twilio booth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like literally over there. It's the only one that is red.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm happy to answer any questions there, but thank you so much for having me and have a great day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjrkXGnF2M&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
