I haven't really seen anything like it before where the hotel chain, kind of like how Airbnb has experiences, has a whole experience program that's not necessarily linked to having to stay at the hotel. I did a search.</p><p>There's more than 500 experiences around the country. You get 10 points per dollar spent plus additional if you have a credit card from Hiatt. I would say getting 10 Hiatt points per dollar on an experience, I probably value Hiatt points at like 1.5 or more cents. That's like 15% cash back.</p><p>So next time I'm looking to book an experience, I'm definitely gonna take a look here. Also feels a bit more curated. When you go to Viator, you go to Get Your Guide, you go to Airbnb experiences, it can be a little bit overwhelming. This feels a little bit more curated.</p><p>I can't speak to the quality, but it feels a little more curated, which I like.</p></div></div></body></html>
