We're gonna talk about the product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we built, the challenges we faced, and how our eval framework came to the rescue and we'll also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">show you some results. A little bit about us and how the product that we built came to be. Last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">year we tried to see if you have any AI play. Our application is designed for real estate agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and brokers and we had a lot of features like contact management, email marketing, social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">marketing, whatever. So we realized that we have a lot of APIs that we've built internally and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have a lot of data. So naturally we came to the unique and brilliant idea that we need to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">an AI agent for our real estate agents. So I'm gonna rewind back a year. Basically last year when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we started this we started with the process of creating a prototype. We built this prototype using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT, the original GPT 3.5 and React framework. It was very very slow and it was making mistakes all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But when it worked, it was a majestic experience. It was a beautiful experience. So we thought okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we got the products in a demo state but now we have to take it to production and that's when we started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">partnering up with Hamill to basically create a production ready product. I'm gonna show you some very very basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">examples of how this product works. Basically agents ask you to do things for them like create a contact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for me with this information or send an email to somebody with some instructions, find me some listings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">things because that's real estate agents tend to do or create a website for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, we created this prototype then we started the improvement of language model phase. The problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">was when we tried to make changes to see if we can improve it, we didn't really know if we're improving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">things or not. We would make a change. We would invoke it a couple of times. You would get a feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that yeah, it worked a couple of times but we didn't really know what the success rate or failure rate was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it gonna work 50% of times or 80% of times? And it's very difficult to launch a production app when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't really know how well it's gonna function. The other problem was we improved the situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We got a feeling that it's okay, it's improving this situation but the moment we changed the prompts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it was likely that it's gonna break other use cases. And we were essentially in the dark. And that's when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we started to partner up with Haml to guide us to see if we can make this app production ready. I'm gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">let him take it from here. Thanks, Emil. So what Emil described is he was able to use prompt engineering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">implement rag, agents, so on and so forth, and iterate with just vibe checks really fast to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from zero to one. And this is a really common approach to building an MVP. It actually works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">really well for building an MVP. However, in reality, this approach doesn't work for that long at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">At least a stagnation. And if you don't have a way of measuring progress, you can't really build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this talk, what I'm gonna go over is a systematic approach you can use to improve your AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">consistently. I'm also gonna talk about how to avoid common traps and give you some resources on how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">learn more because you can't learn everything in a 15-minute talk. This diagram is an illustration of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the recipe of this systematic approach of creating an evaluation framework. You don't have to fixate too much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">on the details of this diagram because I'm gonna be walking through it slowly. But the first thing I want to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about is unit tests and assertions. So a lot of people are familiar with unit tests and assertions if you have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">building software. But for whatever reason, people tend to skip this step. And it's kind of the foundation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for evaluation systems. You don't want to jump straight to LM as a judge or generic evals. You want to try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">write down as many assertions and unit tests as you can about the failure modes that you're that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">experiencing with your large language model. And it really comes from looking at data. So what you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on the slide here are some simple unit tests and assertions that ReChat wrote based upon failure modes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that we observed in the data. And these are not all of them. There's many of these. But these are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">examples of like very simple things like testing if agents are working properly so emails not being sent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or things like invalid placeholders or other details being repeated when they shouldn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The details of these specific assertions don't matter. What I'm trying to drive home is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a very simple thing that people skip. But it's absolutely essential because running these assertions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">give you immediate feedback and are almost free to run. And it's really critical to your overall evaluation system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if you can have them. And how do you run the assertions? One very reasonable way is to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">CI. You can outgrow CI and it may not work as you mature. But one theme I want to get across is use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what you have when you begin. Don't jump straight into tools. Another thing that you want to do with these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">assertions and unit tests is log the results to a database. But when you're starting out, you want to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it simple and stupid. Use your existing tools. So in ReChat's case, they were already using MetaBase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we logged these results to MetaBase and then used MetaBase to like visualize and track the results so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that we could see if we're making progress on these dumb failure modes over time. Again, my recommendation is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">don't buy stuff. Use what you have when you're beginning and then get into tools later. And I'll talk more about that in a minute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we talked a little bit about unit tests and assertions. The next thing I want to talk about is logging and human review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's important to log your traces. There's a lot of tools that you can use to do this. This is one area where I actually do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">suggest using a tool right off the bat. There's a lot of commercial tools and open source tools that are listed on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">slide. In ReChat's case, they ended up using Langsmith. But more importantly, it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not enough to just log your traces. You have to look at them. Otherwise, there's no point in logging them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And one kind of nuance here is that looking at your data is so important that I actually recommend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">building your own data viewing and annotation tools in a lot of cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is because your data and application are often very unique. There's a lot of domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">specific stuff in your traces. So in ReChat's case, we found that tools had too much friction for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we built our own kind of little application. And you can do this very easily in something like Gradio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Streamlet. I use Shiny for Python. It really doesn't matter. But we have a lot of domain specific stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in this like web page, things that allows us to filter data in ways that are very specific to ReChat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but then also lots of other metadata that's associated with each trace that is ReChat specific,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">where I don't have to hunt for information to evaluate a trace. And there's other things going on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not only a kind of a data viewing app. This is also a data labeling app where it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">facilitates human review, which I'll talk about in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the most important part. If you remember anything from this talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it is you need to look at your data and you need to fight as hard as you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to remove all friction in looking at your data, even down to creating your own data viewing apps if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have to. And it's absolutely critical. If you have any friction in looking at data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">people are not going to do it.

What about the test cases? What do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we do about that? Especially when you're starting out, you might not have any users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can use LLMs to systematically generate inputs to your system. So in ReChat's case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we basically use an LLM to cause play as a real estate agent and ask questions as inputs into Lucy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which is their AI assistant, for all the different features and the scenarios and the tools to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">really good test coverage. So I just want to point out that using LLMs to synthetically generate inputs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is a good way to bootstrap these test cases. So we talked a little bit about unit tests, logging traces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, having a human review. And so when you have a very minimal setup like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this is like the very minimal thing, like a very minimal evaluation system, like bare bones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you want to do when you first kind of construct that is you want to test out the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation system.

And the easiest way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">try to make progress on your AI is to do prompt engineering. So what you should do is go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this loop as many times as possible, you know, try to improve your AI with prompt engineering and see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if your test coverage is good.

One thing I want to point out is the upshot of having an evaluation system is you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">get other superpowers for almost free. So all of the work and fine tuning or most of the work is data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">curation. So we already talked about like synthetic data generation and how that interacts with the eval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">framework. And what you can do is you can use your eval framework to kind of filter out good cases and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">feed that into your human review like we showed with that application. And you can start to curate data for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fine tuning. And also for the failed cases, you have this workflow that you can use to work through those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and continuously update your fine tuning data. And what we've seen over time is that the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">comprehensive your eval framework is, the cost of human review goes down because you're automating more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and more of these things and getting more confidence in your data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you have kind of this setup, now you're in a position to know whether or not you're making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">progress or not. You have a workflow that you can use to quickly make improvements. And you can start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">getting rid of those dumb failure modes. But also now you're set up to move into more advanced things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like LLM as a judge. Because you can't express everything as an assertion or a unit test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now LLM as a judge is a deep topic just outside the scope of this talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But one thing I want to point out is it's very, very important to align the LLM judge to a human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you need to know whether you can trust the LLM as a judge.

So what I like to do is, again, keep it simple and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">stupid. I like to use a spreadsheet often. Don't make it complicated. But what I do is have a domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">expert label data, you know, label the critique and critique data and keep iterating on that until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">my LLM as a judge is in alignment with my human judge. And I have high confidence that the LLM judge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is doing what it's supposed to do. So I'm going to go through some common mistakes that people make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">when building LLM as evaluation systems. One is not looking at your data. It's easier said than done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but the people don't do the best job of doing this. And one key to unlocking this is to remove all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">friction, as I mentioned before. The second one, and this is just as important, is focusing on tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not processes. So if you're having a conversation about evals and the first thing you start thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about is tools, that's a smell that you're not going to be successful in your evaluations. People</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like to jump straight to the tools. Tell me about the tools. What tools should I use? It's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">important to try not to use tools to begin with and try to do some of these things manually with what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">already have. Because if you don't do that, you won't be able to evaluate the tools and you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to know what the process is before you jump straight into the tools. Otherwise, you're going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">blindsided. Another common mistake is people using generic evals off the shelf. So don't want to reach for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">generic evals. You want to write evals that are very specific to your domain. Things like conciseness score,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">toxicity score, you know, all these different evals you can get off the shelf with tools. You don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">want to go directly to those. That's also a smell that you are not doing things correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not that they're not valuable at all. It's just that you shouldn't rely on them because they can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">become a crutch. And then finally, the other common mistake is with LLM as a judge and using that too early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I often find that if I'm looking at the data closely enough, I can always find plenty of assertions and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">failure modes. It's not always the case, but it's often the case. So don't go to LLM as a judge too early,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and also make sure you align LLM as a judge with a human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to flip it back over to Emil. He's going to talk about the results of implementing this system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So after we got to the virtuous cycle that Hamill just displayed, we managed to rapidly increase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the success rate of the LLM application. Without the eval framework, a project all similar to this seemed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">completely impossible for us. One thing that I've started to hear a lot is that few-shot prompting is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to replace fine-tuning or some notions like that. In our case, we never managed to get everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that we wanted by few-shot prompting, even using the newer and smarter agents. I wish we could. I've seen a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of judgment of companies and products being just ChatGPT wrappers. I wish we could just be a ChatGPT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">wrapper and manage to extract the experience we want for our users, but we never had that opportunity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because we had some really difficult cases. One of the things that we wanted our agent to be able to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">was to mix natural language with user interface elements like this inside the output, and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially required us to mix structured output and unstructured output together. We never managed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to get this working without fine-tuning reliably. Another thing was feedback. So sometimes the user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">asks in a case like this, do this for me, but the agent can just do that. It needs some sort of feedback,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">more input from the user. Again, something like this was very difficult for us to execute on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">especially given the previous challenge of injecting user interfaces inside the conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And third reason that we had to fine-tune was complex commands like this. I'm going to show a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">tiny video that shows how this command was executed, but basically in this example, the user is asking for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a very complex command that requires using like five or six different tools to be done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, what we wanted was for it to take that input, break it down into many different function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">calls, and execute it. So in this case, I'm asking you to find me some listings with some criteria,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then create a website. That's what real estate agents sometimes do for their listings that they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">responsible for, and also an Instagram post, so they want to market it. They want this done only for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">most expensive listing of these three. So the application has found three listings, created a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">website for that, created and rendered an Instagram post video for it, and then has prepared an email to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Hamill, including all the information about the listings, and also including the website that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">created and the Instagram story that was created, also invited Hamill to a dinner and created a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">follow-up task. Creating something like this for a non-savvy real estate agent may take a couple of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">hours to do, but using the agent, they can do it in a minute, and that essentially was not going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">possible without us using a comprehensive eval framework. Nailed the timing. Thank you guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
