to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">create a campaign that would be two

<span class="t">that's going to become relevant later and here are some of the tools that we we implemented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and attached to our agent unfortunately Alice 2 predated MCP and so we didn't use an MCP server</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or any third-party tool registries and a few things I want to tell you about tools before we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">move on the first is that tools are necessary to take action so anytime you want your agent to do anything on the outside world for example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">call an API or write a file you're going to need a tool to do that they're also necessary to access information beyond the context window if you think about it what your agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">knows is limited to three things the the conversation context the prompt and the model weights and if you wanted to know anything beyond that you need to give it a tool for example a web search tool and that's essentially the concept behind RAG</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">tools can also be used to call other agents this is one of the easiest and simplest ways to to get started with a multi-agent system and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">last but not least tools are preferable over skills so this is a framework I came up with essentially if you think about it if someone asked you to do something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like perform a complex calculation you can do that either through a tool like a calculator or maybe you have the skill of the mental arithmetic that's required to perform that calculation and in general it's better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to use a tool and then to tend to use a skill because this minimizes the amount of tokens you're using in the context to accomplish that goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the strengths of the reactor architecture well I mentioned one already that is that it is extremely simple we basically never needed to revise our agent structure later on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it was also great at handling arbitrary user inputs over multiple turns this is because the graph is running to completion each time it allows the the user to say something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in step three that's related to step one without the the agent getting confused it's actually robust to that so that was a great advantage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but it had some issues for example the react agent was kind of bad at tools we had attached a lot of tools and as you know that what can sometimes happen when you do that is the agent will struggle with which tool to call and in what order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And this would sometimes lead to infinite loops where the agent is repeatedly trying to accomplish some part of campaign creation but not succeeding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And when those infinite loops would go on for a while we would get a recursion limit error which is effectively the the agent equivalent of a stack overflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and also the outputs that we were getting from this version of the agent were relatively mediocre the audiences the sequences the emails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They they they just weren't that good in our hypothesis here was that because there's just one agent and really like one set of prompts that are responsible for doing the entire campaign creation process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't really good at any particular point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So what can we do like how can we address these issues in our case we chose to add structure which led us to implementing a workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">A workflow is defined by Anthropic as a system where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I shamelessly lifted it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Importantly workflows are different from agents and this is one of the things that the agent community has been debating a lot on on Twitter for example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the reason why we have the term agentic for sometimes describing a system as opposed to agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">A system could be agentic but not necessarily an agent per se</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Workflows are highly structured as you probably inferred from that predefined code paths piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The LLM is not choosing how to how to orchestrate the code the LMs are just being called within these predefined code paths</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegwPmaAPQk&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And last but not least workflows are not really a new technology.
