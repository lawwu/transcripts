And what the odds are, I don't know. However, if you listen to their speeches, they tell you they're going to do it, right? They're consistent.

And they quite often very accurately tell you what they're going to do. Putin has been quite clear what he's been up to. Stalin was very clear what he was up to.</p><p>So let's judge Xi Jinping at his word. And he says he's going to go for it.</p></div></div></body></html>
