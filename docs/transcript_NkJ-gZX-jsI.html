And they actually realize that you probably need less money to live a very satisfied life. That's why in the book I've talked about like the freedom number, 'cause you realize that number is actually a lot less than you think.</p><p>What I've recognized though is that most people think it's this big, scary thing. What's crazy about entrepreneurship, you don't need a certificate. (laughs) Everyone has permission. We create this big, scary monster of, well, I've gotta be a talkative person, or I've gotta go be on Twitter, or I've gotta go sell, and that's just not the case.</p><p>You can create a business, it could be a flower shop, and then keep your day job as well, so at AppSumo, where I work, we have this lady, Amy, she has a flower shop and a hair salon, and she's also our head of customer support. You have Nick Christensen, who has a teeth whitening clinic up in Dallas, and he leads our growth team.</p><p>And so it doesn't mean you have to quit your day job. Ideally, maybe have both, but at least have that option available to you.</p></div></div></body></html>
