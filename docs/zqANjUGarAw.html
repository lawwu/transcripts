So that's the sort of practical side. But my feeling is that the use of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">fire wouldn't have caught on if it didn't make foods delicious, more delicious than they'd been in the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">place at the same time.

So proteins, carbohydrates, fats, that's what we think of as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">constituting food.

And so in many cases, even if the stimulation is borderline pleasurable or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">even slightly unpleasurable, we still enjoy the fact that we're being stimulated, that something is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on with our senses of taste and smell. And cooking does that in spades. It takes these molecules with no taste</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or smell and turns them into bouquets of various kinds depending on the original material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, when I think about a piece of steak and if I were to take a bite of it raw,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it would taste very different cold versus room temperature.

You said that heat changes the molecular structure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but what about those changes allow us to taste it more, not just differently? Because as you said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">raw steak is pretty bland.

What's happening? What's being released into the steak?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So what happens is that the materials of the tissue, and in the case of meat, it's mostly protein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and fat.

It agitates molecules at the surface of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">food enough to break them apart into much, much smaller pieces. And it's those pieces that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">experiencing when we take a bite.

But, um, yeah, one has to wonder if, if, um, because the umami, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">receptor stimulation is so closely tied to savoriness and protein and because protein was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">presumably scarce in evolutionary history, whether or not there's some reward pathways that are like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, this is, this is good to, because people had to work really hard under dangerous conditions often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to get umami stimulation. Yes. Yes. Yeah, that's right. And, um, uh, I, I would also say that, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from at least my reading of the, the literature, we only know a tiny, tiny bit about what's going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">when we smell things and taste things. So we know the, the initial step, there's a receptor on our tongue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that responds to glutamate, which, which is associated with this sensation. What happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">after that? Who knows?

So who knows what kind of, you know, crosstalk there might be between the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the receptor on the tongue and the rest of the body.

I heard, um, that tigers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have something like 10,000 fold more umami receptors than humans, but they have no sweet receptors.

But it raises another question too,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which is assuming that's true with the absence of the sweet receptor, perhaps make meat taste completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">different.

Yeah. Can't claim pregnancy either. So, um, you know, because, uh, that people who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3628" target="_blank">01:00:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pregnant, uh, report feeling kind of nauseous to certain tastes at one time a day versus another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Um, is there anything else we can do with our coffee and tea? You know, so I, the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the tannic flavor or the, the experience of a tea being too tannic is awful. It tastes metallic. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3646" target="_blank">01:00:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but when tea's done right, it's very smooth.

So some teas are, uh, just by definition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be more tannic than others because they have been treated differently in order to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3669" target="_blank">01:01:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the dried tea. Um, I have, uh, three or four tea bushes in my backyard.

What kind of tea do you make?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3683" target="_blank">01:01:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, that's the fun thing about having the bushes. I make all kinds and I play around with them and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3689" target="_blank">01:01:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, see what happens if I just, you know, pluck a leaf and brew that or pluck a leaf, let it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">wither in the sun and then brew that or do the various processing techniques. They give you oolong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3703" target="_blank">01:01:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which is kind of medium, um, uh, manipulated.

And you're just putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">these directly into hot water.

I, I make small pots so, so that I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3733" target="_blank">01:02:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">try lots of different things. How do you dry them? Uh, that's another variable. So you can let them air dry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3741" target="_blank">01:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just out on the counter.

And so growing them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3866" target="_blank">01:04:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in the shade is actually fine.

I, for those that aren't familiar, cross-linking proteins is a way of changing their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3993" target="_blank">01:06:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">configuration and making, generally makes them more rigid when we, in laboratories, when we use fixative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=3999" target="_blank">01:06:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, um, you're taking a tissue, usually a slice of brain tissue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which is very floppy and you need to be less floppy so you can work with it.

I would not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">want to do that to the food in my gut. Right. But nowadays we hear that polyphenols are like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">greatest thing. So what's the deal with polyphenols? Um, should we consume them separately from proteins?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4036" target="_blank">01:07:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. No, I, I don't think so because the, the thing about polyphenols, the reason that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4041" target="_blank">01:07:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">do this cross-linking, uh, is the fact that they're reactive. And what that means is you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you put them in with almost anything else and they're going to get bound. And then you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4055" target="_blank">01:07:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">swallow them, uh, and they're going to, you know, make it down to your lower GI tract. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4061" target="_blank">01:07:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there they may be, you know, freed up because the, whatever they're bound to gets to be digested and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4067" target="_blank">01:07:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so on. But there, it's not a bad thing necessarily. And in fact, it's, it's probably a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but the, the thing about polyphenols early on in the process, if you think about what would happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4079" target="_blank">01:07:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">if, for example, you take milk and add some, uh, wine to it and let it sit, it'll curdle.

And so that's basically the kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of thing that's happening inside us.

Uh, if one looks online,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=5895" target="_blank">01:38:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">um, which is always a dangerous thing to do, uh, if you're in search of real information, you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=5900" target="_blank">01:38:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be very discerning. Um, there's this idea that certain cheeses, in particular Parmesan cheeses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=5906" target="_blank">01:38:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">are so rich with the amino acid tyrosine that they create, uh, because tyrosine is the amino acid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=5912" target="_blank">01:38:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">precursor to dopamine that they create, um, a mild high of sorts.

Yeah. Well, so the, the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=5932" target="_blank">01:38:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the, the, the thing that makes cheese much more interesting than milk is the fact that, um, microbes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=5940" target="_blank">01:39:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have been living in it and on it for, um, weeks or months or years and slowly breaking down the proteins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=5951" target="_blank">01:39:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and the fats and generating these small molecules that we were talking about before that have flavor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=5958" target="_blank">01:39:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that, uh, that give us the sensations of taste and smell.

Um, those are, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6028" target="_blank">01:40:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">usually, uh, tyrosine or other amino acid, um, um, derivatives that are, uh, that have been broken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6039" target="_blank">01:40:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">off of the protein chains. And then because the cheese has slowly been dehydrating,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6046" target="_blank">01:40:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, they've become insoluble and begin to crystallize out. And so that's why they're a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6053" target="_blank">01:40:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sign of, um, uh, uh, of the process of aging and also the, the time of aging.

The cheeses have been,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6104" target="_blank">01:41:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">um, kept in a room with, uh, something smoldering.

Ah, that makes sense. So to keep bugs away, you fill the room with smoke and then you end up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6131" target="_blank">01:42:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">food that tastes smoky.

I'm not a fan of smoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6137" target="_blank">01:42:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know why. Uh, yeah. Maybe it's because most smoky flavors seem to come from a kind of a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6143" target="_blank">01:42:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it tastes chemical to me.

It tastes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6164" target="_blank">01:42:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">chemical. Yeah. Yeah. No, I, I know exactly what you mean. And I also think that most smoked foods are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6170" target="_blank">01:42:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">over smoked, you know, that, that ends up being the only flavor that the food has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6175" target="_blank">01:42:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And instead of being a kind of in the background, uh, flavor. So. And what about in bourbons and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6181" target="_blank">01:43:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that, where people get really excited about a smoky bourbon, is that, um, why would you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6186" target="_blank">01:43:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">do that? Because I can't imagine that the bugs that we're going to get into, well, bugs like ferment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6192" target="_blank">01:43:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Is that right? Yeah. Actually, one great way to attract bugs to your picnic is to have vinegar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6199" target="_blank">01:43:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there. They love. Yes. The smell of vinegar. Yeah. Yeah. So in the case of, um, uh, barrels for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6208" target="_blank">01:43:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">distilled beverages, that's, uh, uh, as far as I can tell, just a completely cultural thing, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6216" target="_blank">01:43:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that, um, in order to make barrels, you have to, uh, heat them in order to make the wood pliable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6224" target="_blank">01:43:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably someone in the process of making barrels discovered that if you, you know, if it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6230" target="_blank">01:43:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">burns out of control for a few seconds, that may be not such a bad thing 10 years down the line. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6236" target="_blank">01:43:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">um, um, it's certainly not essential to the flavor of, uh, uh, of alcohols. And a lot, uh, uh, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6243" target="_blank">01:44:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">example, um, um, whiskies may, may be marketed as having been aged in used sherry casks.

And so they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6946" target="_blank">01:55:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pass into our gut unchanged and then we have plenty of microbes who are happy to see those and, and, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqANjUGarAw&t=6953" target="_blank">01:55:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">digest them.
