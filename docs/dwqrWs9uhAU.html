So I used award tool and seats.aero to set up a bunch of alerts from San Francisco and LA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to major European airports and we looked over the dates of the first kind of two weeks of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">four-week window.

So if you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to learn a little bit more about those tools, definitely check that out. And really we didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">care where we ended up because we were only looking at direct flights from San Francisco</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and from pretty much every city in Europe you can get to direct. It's really easy to buy a short</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">ticket from Paris or London or Frankfurt or Zurich to somewhere else in Europe. So we were really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">flexible. And sure enough, on May 25th, I got an alert for four tickets from San Francisco to Paris</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">direct in business class for just 50,000 Air France miles with about $200 in taxes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a ridiculously good deal. But to make it even better, Air France offers 25% off the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">number of miles for children under 12. So their tickets were only 37.5 thousand miles. As a one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">way, these tickets probably would have cost us around $4,500. And in episode 175, I went a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">deeper into this whole process. So if you want to dig deeper, go there. But I don't think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">quite fair to use that 4,500 number because a lot of international one way flights are way more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive than round trips. And honestly, if we booked this trip out of pocket, we would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">paid for a round trip. Most of the round trip flights were closer to the same price, about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">$4,500, but let's just use the value of $200 for this flight. So our total outlay was 175,000 points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">plus $800 in taxes. Relative to what we would have had to pay for those, we were getting about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">4.1 cents per point, which is absolutely awesome. If you look at a card like my Amex gold, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">earns 4X points on dining and groceries, then being able to get 4.1 cents on 4X points per</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">dollar is like getting an effective 16.4% cash back on dining and grocery spend, which is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now Air France does have a 70 euro per person fee to cancel, but we were okay with that because we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">knew that there was a decent chance we'd take the trip and worst case we'd be out a few hundred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars if we had to cancel. As for the flight home, we waited a few days, we set up some alerts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and eventually we got an alert for a direct flight from Amsterdam back to San Francisco 12 days after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we left, which was perfect. Now it's important anytime you think about booking flights to not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">just book on the airline that has the availability because it might be way better to book through one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of their partners. So I've set up this transfer partner spreadsheet. You can find it on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">product section of our homepage. And what you'll see is that there's a handful of Star Alliance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">partners that are partners of United that you can transfer points to from any of the major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">credit card points programs. Now I went through this in a lot of detail in episode 184 and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the different ways to do it, but the short version is I could have booked it through United for 80,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">points and $93 in taxes per person. And this is all for a one way business class ticket per person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And United would have given me free cancellation, which is great, but it was 80,000 points. Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Aeroplan is another way I could have done it. And it was 70,000 points plus $144 in taxes and fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe you could argue that slightly better, but $110 to cancel. On the bonus, Aeroplan is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a transfer partner of a lot of different programs. So it's a lot easier to get those points than if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you were trying to get United miles. They also have an option where you can spend a few more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">miles and get free cancellation. So that option was 85,000 points, but the same taxes and fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">However, at the time there was a 20% transfer bonus from a popular bank. And that transfer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus brought that price down significantly. However, I already had Aeroplan points from when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">built had a hundred percent transfer bonus. So this was already a pretty great option,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'll just remind everyone of the third option, because I just want to make sure you realize how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">lucrative it can be to spend a little time on this process. And that was looking at Life Miles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which is, uh, from Avianca and they're also a Star Alliance partner. And that same flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was 63,000 points and $115 in taxes. Now that was, if I was willing to accept a $200 per person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">cancellation fee, but they have this Life Miles plus program that you can pay for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That was going to be an effective about $65 a person in extra cost, but it would give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">free cancellation and a refund of some of your miles, which ended up being about 40,000 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the total cost was going to come down even further from that 63,000 miles when you netted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it all out. However, there was also a 15% transfer bonus from Amex to Life Miles, which made it even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">better deal. We ended up doing the Aeroplan option and we did it with some extra flexibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for 85,000 points, because in our mind, we had used the built a hundred percent transfer bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these points were effectively even less. So it was almost 42,500 points if you factor that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in. And so these transfer bonuses can be really awesome. For example, on September 1st, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">recently built had another great one where it was 50% transfer bonus to Avianca. So if you needed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">those 63,000 points, you actually only needed to transfer 42,000 and that's 42,000 to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">international business flight with $115 in taxes, which is absolutely amazing. Now, since I'd priced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all of this out, Avianca has increased some of their flight award costs, you know, devalued,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's 63,000, I think only went up to 70,000. So it's really not that big of a difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at what I ended up doing, spending 85,000 points, if you don't factor in the transfer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus, it was still two and a half cents per point. You want to factor in the fact that those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Aeroplan points were a hundred percent transfer bonus, then we're closer to five cents per point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but even at two and a half cents, it's a great value.

We had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">flights booked and it was now time to make a plan, but here's a little wrench. As we started thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do, we really started to second guess our decision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to take two toddlers overseas for two weeks. We were actually less concerned about the time changes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but our youngest is still napping and doesn't nap in a stroller. And on top of that, we found it so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hard to find hotels in Europe that allowed four people to a room. And then we started thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about how next year it would be so much easier that girls wouldn't be napping. And just around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that time, I was recording episode 187 with Lee Rowan about travel planning. And it popped into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">my head, his question and his comment, are we choosing this trip or is this trip choosing us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And after a good heart to heart with Amy, we realized that this trip was definitely choosing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">us. And we just felt like we would be much happier punting the entire trip, the big international</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">family vacation, one year when we were out of naps and it would be a little bit more enjoyable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we decided we were going to cancel the trip. However, one really interesting thing happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I had realized a few days earlier that somehow we booked our flights to Paris right in the middle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Olympics. And you probably don't know this, but Amy is an absolutely massive fan of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Olympics. The entire time it's happening, if she's not watching it live, she's watching replays of so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">many different sports. Now that's not to say I don't love the Olympics. I do love the Olympics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but for Amy, it's at a whole different level. And on top of that, and we were about to turn 40</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and we didn't really have any big plans to celebrate. So when my parents naturally asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">me if there was anything I wanted for my birthday, of which, you know, from episode 188, there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">not. I threw out the idea that what if we drove the kids to their house with our au pair and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all could watch the kids for a week and we could take a 40th birthday trip. They said yes to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">surprise. And it was time to plan an entirely different trip and give Amy and myself, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the best 40th birthdays ever. So first step, I canceled the kids' tickets to Paris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We ate the 140 euro fee and we canceled our return flights, which thankfully, because I booked with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">few more aeroplane miles had no fee. And now we needed to figure out a plan. And so we started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with return flights. And the reason we did this was because we had a lot less flexibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">My parents agreed to some certain dates. And so we really had two dates that we could find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">flights back home, but we only needed two seats. And because the kids weren't with us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we had a lot more flexibility on our ability to take a layover if necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Fortunately, it wasn't hard to find two seats from Zurich back to San Francisco direct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we were using a combination of point dot me and award tool, but points. Yeah. Seats dot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">arrow. There are so many options. Go back and listen to that episode with Greg, the frequent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">miler, if you want to run through of all of them. But we found these flights and we were actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">able to use some of those refunded air Canada miles to book them. Though this time we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">less than a month out. So we actually opted to take a little risk and do the 70,000 point option</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where we would have to pay a hundred dollars per person to cancel and get our points back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But we felt pretty optimistic that we were going on this trip. And so now we had flights to and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">from Europe and it was time to plan the best six day 40th birthday in Europe ever. And here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what we did. Now we were landing in Paris three days before the Olympics ended, and we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">been to Paris a handful of times. So we knew we didn't want to be there for the entire trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was time to find an Epic place to relax for three or four days. And honestly, we knew</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that there were so many options that would be amazing. So whether it was in France or Spain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or Italy, Switzerland, Portugal, or plenty of other places, we knew it would be great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we actually decided to let the points guide us. And the only requirement aside from a beautiful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">relaxing resort is that it needed to be a direct flight away from Paris and a direct flight away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">from Zurich, which really wasn't too bad. So I started doing some research to pull together a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">shortlist of hotels, and I do wish this step was a little easier, but I went to the Marriott, Hilton,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Hyatt, IHG sites.

You can search by award category, brand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you can even search by some features, like I only want a hotel with a pool or a spa,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can find all of the options. For some of the sites on the Marriott side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a little easier to search by country because they don't all have maps and then narrow down by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">filtering for their luxury brands.

And there are a lot of options, but if you start to look at where the warm summer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">destinations, it was really just following the coast from Portugal all the way to Italy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and then some of the islands in between. So now armed with a few ideas and a few places,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I started thinking that the award search tools for hotels that we covered in episode 167 would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">actually serve me a little better. There was a Waze, PointsYeah, Rooms.arrow, AwardTool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and honestly, all of them probably would have worked. Some of them are better than others if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have a specific region in mind. For example, on a Waze, it's really nice that once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you find a place, so let's say you wanted to search for Nice in France, you'd be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">search for Nice and see all the hotels nearby in a 30-mile radius. But then if you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">move the map down the coast and go to Cannes or Monaco, you can do that and redo the search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So since I kind of knew where the airports were, I just started kind of moving around and looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at these different regions and finding a ton of great options. At the time, either it didn't exist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">or I wasn't sure, but PointsYeah has this Daydream Explorer tool for flights that just kind of says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"I don't know where I'm going.

They now have the same thing for hotels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so that probably would have been another decent option. The good news is there were so many good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">options for Points. A few highlights were the Seven Pines in Sardinia and Ibiza,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the Hotel Martinez in Cannes, but as soon as I found one particular hotel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of knew it was the one. And it was this property called Cap Rocat in Mallorca, Spain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was so familiar because a listener named Camden had emailed me almost two years ago</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about going there for his honeymoon. And I remember at the time looking up the hotel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and I was like, "This is incredible. The entire property is built inside of an ancient fortress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">carved from sandstone. It's part of the SLH, or Small Luxury Hotel Program, which at the time I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">think was partnered with Hyatt and is now partnered with Hilton. And it's an all-suites hotel with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">only 30 rooms. And fortunately, because it's now partnered with Hilton, you can use your Points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and free night certificates to stay there." And I was surprised that the four nights we wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">go were wildly available. And I say that I was fortunate because this is not a cheap hotel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The room rate, the four nights we went, was about $2,900 a night after taxes. And we were looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to stay for four nights. So that's a total of almost $12,000, which was something that I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">never would be able to pull the trigger on myself. However, we were able to use two free night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">certificates and 260,000 Hilton Points to bring the total down to $0. I'm not kidding. When we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">checked out, there was no taxes or fees or anything. We just paid for the food we consumed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and the taxes and fees on those food. And the whole bill we had after four days was about $500.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was mostly food activities and whatnot. How did we get those points? So we got them from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">two welcome offers, one from the Hilton Aspire Card and one from the Hilton Surpass Card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The Hilton Aspire Card every year comes with a free annual night certificate. The Surpass Card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">did have a promotional period where it came with a free night as a welcome bonus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but it doesn't anymore. However, after spending $15,000 on the card, you get a free night every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">year also. The welcome bonus on both those cards also was 130,000 points or more. So just from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">opening those two cards, we were able to get together enough points and free night certificates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to book the entire four-night stay. So when you think about the value of a welcome bonus, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">unoften do you find a welcome bonus worth almost $6,000, which in this case was what it was worth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if we had just done this on Hilton points and we didn't have any free night certificates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it would have been 520,000 Hilton points, which is still a great value. Most sites value Hilton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">points at about half a cent, which is fair because you can buy them at half a cent also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but this booking valued them at 2.2 cents per point. Now, that's pretty interesting because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not everyone has that many points, but if you can buy points at half a cent and redeem them at 2.2</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">cents, that means that even without Hilton cards, even without Hilton points in your balance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you could have just spent $2,600, bought the points you needed for this trip,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and saved yourself $9,000 on the cost of the hotel. Now, the only catch here is Hilton does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have a cap of how many points you can buy a year, but they do let you combine and transfer points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">with your family and friends. So the easy workaround is to buy them separately and combine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">them together. Even better, if you booked this all with points, you get a fifth night free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the value would have gone up by another 25%. Now, I was really struggling with this because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea that we were going to stay four nights and not get our fifth night free kind of made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the optimizer side of me frustrated, but we were only going to be there four nights. We didn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">any use. We weren't even staying late enough that it would make sense to try to get the fifth night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">free. And when you mix a reservation with free night certificates and points, it actually doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">qualify. So I actually felt a little bit better. But for a moment, I was like, "How do I optimize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this a little bit more?" And then I said, "You know what? It doesn't matter." So I'm excited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to share more about the property. And like I said, Amy's going to join me and we're going to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">through that. But I want to wrap up the rest of this booking process because it's not just one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">hotel and two flights. There's a lot of things that go into this, finding a place to stay in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Paris. We wanted to buy tickets to the Olympics, make some reservations, get a rental car, get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">those flights within Europe. And I think walking you through all of those processes and decisions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">would be super valuable because the tactics I use are ones that you can use as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe not the Olympics tickets. Who knows? If you do want to go to Italy in '26 or LA in '28,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe they're relevant. So now that we got all that out of the way, we needed to book the hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in Paris. That was kind of my process was let's put up all this scaffolding and we've got the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">flights, we've got the hotel in Mallorca, let's get the hotel in Paris. And despite my worry about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">prices during the Olympics, there were actually a ton of options. And when I was doing research,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I read that similar thing happened in London as well for the Olympics there. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a window where it's far enough out that no one knows how crowded it's going to be and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">prices are really expensive. But actually, as you get closer, they seem to come down a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So first off, if you're ever booking some big event, I'd encourage everyone to make a refundable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">reservation early so you have it just in case things are expensive. I was actually able to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple options on Marriott where you could book something refundable with points just to have it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">while I was searching for what I really wanted. So that's one piece of advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we looked at a lot of things. This is where the hotel search tools also really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">really shine because we knew exactly where we wanted to go. So I could hop on any of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tools. I could dial in Paris, put in the exact two nights we needed and see all of the options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was really, really helpful to be able to do that. And you could do that on any of these tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and get a great experience. And while we found over a dozen decent options, there was one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">actually stood out to me. And that was the Hyatt Madeline. It was super central. And despite being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty expensive at 35,000 Hyatt points a night, which might sound like not that many if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">used to other hotel programs, but Hyatt points are just so much more valuable. But the cash rate was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">actually $1,200. So that was still a value over 3 cents per point. So great redemption value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But what stood out the most was that I had seen this Reddit post a day or two before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can put a link to it in the show notes, but a traveler who'd stayed at a hundred plus Hyatts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">made this tier list of every single one.

So I was like, wow, someone who stayed at a lot of Hyatt said this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one is at the top. It was really central. It looked great. And the redemption value was awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had a bunch of Hyatt points from opening a Hyatt card recently. So despite that it was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">non-refundable rate. We decided to go for it. Now, unfortunately I only have Hyatt discover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a status, which means you don't get free breakfast.

I think I'm at four nights for the year.

Now, someone who reaches globalist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">has probably picked up a handful of these through different milestone awards that you get as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">earn more and more nights and being a globalist, they don't need it for themselves. So if you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">ask around and have a friend that's got globalist status with Hyatt, I found that people are pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">generally willing to offer these to friends and family for free. However, there are a handful of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">communities online where people trade them and the going rate is about $50, which is a good example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of a topic I can't really go deep on on the podcast publicly. But if you search around online,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm confident you'll find something, or if you want, I'm probably going to share more details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about stuff like that in the All The Hacks membership, which we've linked to on the website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I managed to find a guest of honor certificate. I got that added. So now we got free breakfast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">lined up, which by the way, breakfast for two is a meaningful value, right? Well more than $50</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">across two days and two people. And so also that globalist status that would be applied through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that guest of honor certificate made us eligible for a free room upgrade. And if we needed free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">parking, it would be included, though we definitely didn't. So we've got our two hotel stays booked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I needed to book our European flights. And fun fact, they are called intra-European flights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not inter-European flights, which would be between Europe and another continent and which I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">gotten mistaken in the past. And when we looked at our options, there were really two options for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">both legs. And this is something that I often find when booking flights domestically and in Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can usually save a bit when you book the discount airline, but, or pay a premium to book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of the national airline. So in the US it would be a United, Delta, Southwest, a bigger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">non-budget airline versus a Spirit, a Frontier. In this case, the Air France option was like $500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and the discount options were all about $150 to $200. Normally, I would love to book on Air France</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or Swiss Air because one, when things go wrong, they typically are better at taking care of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And two, they just run more frequent flights. So if the morning flight on Air France was canceled,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they'd probably be able to put us on the midday flight. But a lot of times, budget and discount</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">airlines, they only have one flight a day from certain airlines. And so you're probably going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to be stuck to the next day. I'm also familiar with the fact that when you book a flight for $150</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on a really discounted airline, by the time you add in the fees for your bags, even a carry-on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">by the time you order some food or pick your seats or anything like that, the price is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">potentially going up quite a bit. So all things being equal, I would always prefer to book on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the Air France or the Swiss Air. But in this case, it was just significantly more expensive even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">after adding all those things up. And if you actually looked, there were a handful of flights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on different discount carriers from the Paris airport. We were looking at Paris Orly airport,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which was a breeze to get to. I'd never actually flown out of that airport. And both on the airline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we looked at, which was Transavia, and on a few others. So I felt pretty optimistic that if there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">was an issue, if someone canceled, I'd probably get a notification very quickly on TripIt or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Flighty, and I'd be able to jump on and book something and be able to get out the same day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I was really frustrated though, going through the booking process, because when you go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a booking on Transavia, you have to decide, do I want the basic flight, the plus flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the max flight, which are really just like bundles of other things, or you can choose the basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">flight and then go add on things. And depending on what you pick, the amount of changes you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">allowed to make, the cost of those changes, the seat selection, the cabin luggage, the checked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">luggage, the number of points you earn on flying blue, because it turns out Transavia is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">subsidiary of Air France. All those things change. And they don't make it easy to find out, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">well, what would this thing be if I wait? So you end up having to go pick basic, add on a few things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">go back, check it out. And honestly, it was a little bit of a stressful process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing that really pushed me over the edge of how we ended up deciding what to do and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately creating a new money rule was the fact that I looked at the measurements for our carry-on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is an away carry-on. And it was a one centimeter over the European dimensions. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">one centimeter is not that much. So I wasn't sure how much that really mattered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but also all of the limits for these discount airline carry-ons was 10 kilograms, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about, I think, 22 pounds. And I weighed my carry-on and it was probably about 26 pounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I had no idea how strict they'd be enforcing these rules. And the last thing I want to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">pay for my carry-on, get to the gate, find out I have to check my bag. Now I have to pay a check</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bag fee, but that check bag fee is now twice as expensive because I didn't do it in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I did something that you all might find pretty surprising because I really would rather</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">carry on a bag. I don't want to lose a bag on such a short trip. So what I did was I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just booked the fancy version of the flight. So on Transavia's case, I booked the max flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which includes fast track security, priority boarding, extra miles for your flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of those different things. It ended up being more expensive. I want to say it was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">30, 40, $50 more than if I had optimally booked what I wanted. But had I booked a carry-on and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">needed to then pay for a checked bag, it was actually going to be a lot more expensive than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that. I can't tell you how great it was to just be like, "I booked this one thing. Now I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">have to think about it." And that felt really good. On Condor, I'm actually going to go as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">far as to say, I'm not even sure it is a discount airline having now flown on it, but in my mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it was because it was much, much cheaper than the Swissair flight. And they really only have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">economy or business, but that's what it looks like on the surface. Once you click economy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">they have economy light, economy class, economy class flex, economy class flex plus, business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">business flex, and business flex plus. And I'm just looking at one flight here. And the range</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is economy light at 113 all the way to business flex plus at 367. So first off, super annoying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's just so difficult to see this. Kudos to them for at least showing on economy light,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to check in at the airport, it costs $30. If you want to do something, some of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">fees are there. Some of them aren't. It says 8kg of hand baggage for a fee. So after a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of back and forth on their website, I realized same about $30, $40, $50 more if I wanted to book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the business class version of the ticket, which included expedited security, lounge access,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and all this stuff. Condor, I had never actually heard of Condor, even though I learned later that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they fly direct from San Francisco to either Frankfurt or Munich. It turns out it used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1736" target="_blank">00:28:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">be a subsidiary of Lufthansa. It is then later a subsidiary of Thomas Cook, the travel company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but now is independent. And so we ended up booking that. That meant that our total flights round trip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from Paris to Mallorca, Mallorca to Zurich were about $500. But it also meant that we got to pick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">our seats. We got to sit in the front of the plane. We got priority boarding. We actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">got a meal on the Condor flight. And we knew that no matter what we wanted to do with our bags,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we wouldn't have to pay anything extra. Could I have saved $100 a person if we didn't do all that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely. Was it all worth it? 100,000% over and over. In fact, in the spirit of having these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">money rules in our lives, Amy and I added one to our list, which was that if we're ever taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a discounted carrier to save money, we are always going to spend whatever it costs to just make that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">experience better. That means being able to not wait in the long line. That means not having to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">decide whether you're going to carry your bag on and check it or anything else. And it was totally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">worth it to us. I'll talk about the experience flying both airlines, but that is a new rule for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">us. Finally, last thing to book was our rental car in Mallorca. And wow, it was very cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So it didn't matter where I looked. For four days, it was going to be somewhere between $100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and $200. So as I always do, I looked on AutoSlash first because it's just a great comparison site.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I went to the individual rental car company websites because sometimes AutoSlash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">won't search any special kind of discounts you have. And so with Hertz and National,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a discount associated with having an Amex Platinum card. With Sixth, I had a discount from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Founder's Card. Surprisingly, those discounts were all much better than the AutoSlash rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd heard some horror stories when I was looking online for renting cars in Mallorca</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that during the summer, it can be crazy and you show up and your car's not there. You have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">wait a few hours. And all these reservations were pay at the counter. You didn't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">prepay anything. So I booked a car at Hertz, and then I booked a backup car at Sixth half an hour</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">later. They're both around $150 for four days. And for both of them, I booked an automatic Mini Cooper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which we thought would be kind of fun. I really wanted to book a convertible for the summer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but I really didn't want to spend an extra $300 to do that, given that we didn't really have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of plans to be in the car. Now, despite using the Platinum card discount, you can actually put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in whatever travel card gives you the best rental car protection. And then you could decline the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">collision insurance, which is exactly what we did. Last thing to book was our tickets to the Olympics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was wildly surprised at how easy it was to get tickets. Thanks probably in part to the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that France has very strict regulations that pretty much prevent all reselling of tickets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">above face value, which actually meant that you could buy tickets for all the events we wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to go to, which in our case were beach volleyball and track and field at face value. They had two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">options for how you book it. And hopefully this is similar to the future because obviously none</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of you are going to be going to France, so I'll keep it quick. But you could basically book tickets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">purchased directly from the Olympics, which were at face value. And you could pick a section. There</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">was like an A, B, C, D level, but you didn't know what seats you got. Or you could buy them on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">resale platform, but also at face value, plus a 10% fee. But there you could actually pick which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">seats you got. And so naturally I was like, "Well, let's go look at the seat maps. Let's try to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">seats at track and field that are on the side of the finish line. Let's get beach volleyball seats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that have a great view of the Eiffel Tower." And so that's what we did. And all in all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we ended up getting amazing seats. It ended up being about $300 a ticket, which I thought was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a great deal. But given that we were booking this a few weeks before and I had just mentally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">prepared myself to pay astronomical prices, which we didn't, I'm not sure how this will work when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we're in LA in four years trying to book Olympics tickets and there aren't these rules on resales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the Olympics committee will force some rules like that. Either way, I would highly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">recommend entering the ticket lottery in advance where you can pick some events and hopefully get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">drawn. That's what we're going to do. Unfortunately, there was no good way to buy these tickets on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">points. So we just paid. Of course, we paid with a card to earn the most points. Absolutely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we did that. But there was no secret there. But with those tickets purchased, we knew we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have two great days in Paris to do the Olympics, four days in Mallorca to kind of relax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was going to be an amazing trip. So that's all the booking we did. Amy made one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">dinner reservation at an awesome restaurant that we'll talk about.

So overall, what did you think of the trip? I would say 10 out of 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing. It was really incredible. I think the combination of going to the Olympics in Paris,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it was very fast paced, very energized, combined with then going to Mallorca, which was felt a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">more relaxing and just a bit a better opportunity to decompress was a really nice combination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I would recommend it. Not that people can repeat the Olympics in Paris, but I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">highly recommend the combo. Okay, so let's start with where we started. We went to SFO,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we got there a little bit early, and we stopped at a brand new lounge, the Club Lounge at SFO,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Terminal 1. We've been to lots of lounges. What did you think of that one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this lounge was particularly great because it felt very spacious. And it was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">beautiful, especially because so many lounges nowadays are overly crowded, in my opinion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that the food from the lounge, it was fine.

We didn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">drinks because we were like, as soon as we get on this plane, we want to go to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we didn't want to have too much dehydration, too much alcohol and sleep poorly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say one shout out to Rebecca, who listener of the podcast was in the lounge also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2129" target="_blank">00:35:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">noticed me came over and said, Hi, awesome experience.

Okay, so after the lounge, walked over international,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">got on Air France. We took a really nice Air France flight to Paris. It was not outfitted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with first class. So La Primaire, Air France is like marquee first class. This didn't have it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It just had business. But it was a really nice business class. What did you think?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the plane felt really nice and new. I really... I particularly enjoyed the doors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The ability to close off my seat felt amazing, especially because when you get on a flight where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know you're going to be on the go right when you land, it just felt really nice knowing I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">close my door, sleep for six, seven hours, and not be interrupted with food choices or any other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of service. So I thought that was wonderful. Yeah, the deal seeker in me couldn't do it. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">two problems. One, my door was broken. So I couldn't close it just practically. The deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">seeker in me, though, was like, "Gosh, this meal looks really good. I'm really excited."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And Amy asked, "Could I get the meal if I wake up in a few hours?" And they were like, "Not all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it. We're only going to serve fresh food when it's fresh." So I stayed up. I ate the meal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2216" target="_blank">00:36:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It was delicious. Honestly, I don't remember exactly what I ate. So maybe it wasn't as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">memorable as I think. But overall, a great experience, except that our goal was to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you went straight to sleep. I ate, went straight to sleep. We slept most of the flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think. Yeah. Had a nice little breakfast before we got there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Didn't get to enjoy the in-flight entertainment as much as I wanted. The screen was big. It did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2241" target="_blank">00:37:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have wireless charging, which was pretty cool. You could just set your phone on a little table,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and it charged. I like that. Overall, Air France, 50,000 miles, one-way business class,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and a couple hundred dollars in taxes and fees. I thought it was great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Agree. The other thing I would call out that was really nice is sometimes in business class seats,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the middle, the divider is relatively small. But in the seats we had, it was huge. And so it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">just opened up a lot more space for the two of us to hang out, talk. We ended up sleeping. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess it's irrelevant. But I thought that was nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I will say if you're flying with two people, take a look at photos when you're picking...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're in business class, because sometimes the middle two seats are always the same. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes they switch, which actually happened on our flight home. And there's one version where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they face inward. And it's a less optimal experience for two people traveling together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's one where they're a little bit more facing outwards. And there's a lot more space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">between. Way better experience than sitting across the aisle from each other. So that was great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So landed in Paris, went straight to the hotel to check in the Hyatt Paris Madeline, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned that we booked because it just had stunning reviews from someone on Reddit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">My quick take was almost no complaints, but nothing that really stood out. We got an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">upgrade, which was amazing. We use the guest of honor certificate. Breakfast was fantastic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but nothing was wildly exceeding expectations, other than that it was just a very solid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">good hotel. More spacious than a lot of European hotels often are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2343" target="_blank">00:39:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I would agree with that. It was solid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2347" target="_blank">00:39:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2347" target="_blank">00:39:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The few things they did that stood out to me. One, it's called Hotel Madeline. And so they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">would put out little Madeline cookies in the afternoon. So I thought that was a cute little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">touch. The other thing they did is when the forecast called for rain, they set out umbrellas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which I thought was also kind of a nice thing. It felt like the service was there. But you're right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">there wasn't anything particularly special about it. It was just a nice quality hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that was also very spacious for being Paris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep. Obviously, we weren't there to stay in the hotel. That was the next trip. So for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it was about location. Location was amazing. I think we walked pretty much everywhere we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">went in Paris. We might have taken one or two subways only to get up to the Stade de France,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and to and from the airport, of course. Other than that, that's it. And for anyone going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Paris that's never been, getting on the RER B from Paris into the city couldn't be easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2405" target="_blank">00:40:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Riding the Paris subway couldn't be easier.

I think it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a great city to just put on your shoes and get out there and explore by walking. There's so many cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">neighborhoods and bars and restaurants and all of that. I wish I would have brought better walking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">shoes. We walked maybe 15 to 20 miles in one day, and my feet were killing me by the end of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's my only complaint.

And I also was like, "That was a mistake." I had to ask the waiter at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">restaurant we went to if they had a Band-Aid because I was like, "I don't think I can make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the walk home."

But the airline divided their check-in counters by destination. So we went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to a Transavia counter and we waited for like 10 minutes, got to the front and they're like, "Sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this set of counters are for these 10 flights.

If it doesn't, it's a great process. So take your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">microphones, take your laptops, take your liquids, take everything out.

So the whole thing just felt pretty chaotic to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my hypothesis... So I don't know why they did this. They lined us all up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They checked everyone in and we went down the jet bridge.

My hypothesis is that given it's a budget airline, they wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">use fewer crew.

And then that same crew could help board the plane. That's my only hypothesis because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3116" target="_blank">00:51:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we were all standing in this line.

I'm gonna blame Transavia, not the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Orly Airport.

We'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">get to that. But picking up the car was so easy. We rented from Hertz. It was very clear that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Mallorca was a sixth rental car airport. There were six signs everywhere. They had priority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in every possible way.

So I would say we did this and I'd recommend everyone do it. When you get there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">do a very thorough walk around the car, take lots of pictures. If you have dents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have dings, even if they're pretty small.

Abroad, if there's a little ding, someone cares. And when we were leaving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever you leave a rental car in the US, you usually go through a gate and someone looks at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your paperwork. Here, that wasn't the case. So if there was something wrong, make sure you go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">back to the desk and say, "Hey, we noticed this thing that was wrong.

And it wasn't a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But just note for everyone else, it was a little mini Cooper.

So renting a car</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3280" target="_blank">00:54:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was the right move.

I'd heard about this hotel for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">2 years.

I think the few things to note, one, it is about 20 minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from Palma, which is the closest main downtown area. And so again, if you want to go out and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">explore and walk around, you have to drive or take a car if you stay at Capricot. The other thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3528" target="_blank">00:58:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that I would note is, would we have paid full price? For us, it's difficult because we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3535" target="_blank">00:58:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">points and miles junkies. So it's difficult to say that. But I will say it was such an incredible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">use. Maybe some of the best use we've gotten out of these free night certificates. Would you agree?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3549" target="_blank">00:59:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely the best use out of free night certificates because we've only been playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that game for two years on Hilton. But when I think of all the places we've booked with points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3558" target="_blank">00:59:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and miles and been able to stay, I think Capricot and any hotel in Bora Bora probably are just right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">up there. And the one thing that I think makes Mallorca maybe slightly more special than Bora</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3576" target="_blank">00:59:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Bora, and I know how special Bora Bora is to you. So I already see in your eyes what you're saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is, Palma is a really cool city with amazing restaurants and cafes. And so it felt like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we could have that relaxing vibe. We probably only left the hotel twice in 4 days or 5 days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3596" target="_blank">00:59:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But when we did, we were able to go and explore a little bit more. When you're on Bora Bora,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you have this amazing, amazing experience. But outside of the resort, there's not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">anything there. So when we were there, hung out at the pool, took out a kayak, relaxed on the beach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3615" target="_blank">01:00:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">swam inside, relaxed in our room. The breakfasts were unbelievable. I remember the guy told us the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3622" target="_blank">01:00:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">first day when we checked in, he said, "Okay, you can have 2 choices. You can say, 'Just give me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">everything,' or you can pick what you want. I suggest you say, 'Give me everything,' the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3630" target="_blank">01:00:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">day. And we'll just bring you everything in the morning. And then on subsequent days, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">decide what you want." I think we had more food there than at the Michelin star dinner in Paris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There was so much food. I almost felt bad. Actually, I did feel bad that we didn't eat at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But amazing breakfast. I think about that breakfast regularly. I wish someone woke me up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with that breakfast every day. Boy, would that be nice. Quite the opposite right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We instead wake up and make that breakfast for our kids, but nothing near it. It was great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3661" target="_blank">01:01:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Agree. So that was Capricot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Highly recommend. Absolutely amazing use of Hilton certificates, Hilton points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Few other things on Majorca. We did do one day trip. We went up to Soler. We went to the old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">town and the port town. I enjoyed walking around. It felt like you got a little bit more of a vibe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3682" target="_blank">01:01:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of Majorca. I don't know. Anything else to add from our little day trip?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The towns in Majorca are probably like this where the streets are very small and the buildings just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3693" target="_blank">01:01:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">look really magical. And you just kind of get lost in these alleyways of cute shops and homes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's definitely worth just getting out and walking around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think the really cool thing when we walked around the port town,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3709" target="_blank">01:01:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it was very clear because I think it was just a weekend. Families were out. People were playing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They're all hanging out. It's really nice to see all these playgrounds. It actually made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">us a little bit sad. We're like, "I think the girls would love this. There's an ocean. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a playground. The water's warm." They had these awesome little paddle boats, which everyone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">seen a paddle boat. But for some reason, every paddle boat at this marina had a water slide on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it, which I'd never seen in my whole life. So that was really cool. Only other thing that I'll add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in Palma... So we went down to Palma twice, once for dinner at a restaurant called Vandal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't go to other restaurants, so I can't speak to them. I thought it was incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3748" target="_blank">01:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What did you think? The food was so good. I loved that it almost had this punk rock vibe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3754" target="_blank">01:02:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">where they weren't there to cater to you. And they did. But in a way that felt very much like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3764" target="_blank">01:02:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we're all friends just here to sit down, eat, and have a good time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a really cool, laid-back vibe. Yes. We sat at the bar. All their plates have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhat offensive phrases on them. Provocative phrases. Yeah. And I loved it. I loved the vibe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of that restaurant. There were a lot of other restaurants that seemingly had white table</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">claws and looked nice. I think our style is like, "Let's sit at the bar. Let's get a great cocktail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's have some really good food." But you get no extra points for fine dining for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3801" target="_blank">01:03:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Good food and casual at the bar is better than fine dining. So that was exactly what I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to do. We walked around a bit, got some ensimadas, which is like a classic Mallorcan pastry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We also walked around the palace, the cathedral. Pretty impressive. I can't remember. I looked it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">up. It took like 3 or 400 years. 400.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">400 years to build this cathedral. It's massive. We'll put a link in the show notes. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">wild. A lot of Palma felt really modern and cool. And this was very old and really fun to walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">around. I think that if we were maybe younger, we would have enjoyed some of the nightlife of Palma,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which we've heard about. We've watched on our many nights binging Below Deck Mediterranean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which has got a little guilty pleasure. But we instead went back early and got some sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3854" target="_blank">01:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep. I'm okay with that. Yes. This was not a trip to go out and party. At one point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "Should we do it? Should we do it?" No, no, no. We definitely should.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That was Paris for us. Yes. Paris, we were out late. Shout out to Whitney and Carl,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">friends from back home, who dragged us out one night till, I don't know, past midnight at least.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3871" target="_blank">01:04:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And eventually, we're like, "We got to go." And they're like, "Well, we have a flight in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">eight hours. Why do you have to go? You don't have anything to do tomorrow." But that was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fun night. I love Paris. I feel like we've had many nights in Paris where you just end up somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3883" target="_blank">01:04:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at one or two in the morning. And it's always a good time. Yep. By the way, the bikes in Paris,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3889" target="_blank">01:04:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Lime bikes and things like that, you can pick up so easily. And aside from me cutting you off and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3897" target="_blank">01:04:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">almost knocking you off the road, which was not intentional, I just realized I was driving the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3902" target="_blank">01:05:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong way in a particular road. Other than that, it was great. Okay, trip home. Pretty straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned how we booked Condor Business Class to get to Zurich. And that got us into the lounge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3916" target="_blank">01:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at the Mallorca Airport. Mallorca Airport is fine. Lots of options to buy things to take home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3923" target="_blank">01:05:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Lounge was empty. It was a very strange lounge because they had a massive boardroom. It looked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3929" target="_blank">01:05:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like I was walking through an office, but quite a lot of food, drinks, everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3934" target="_blank">01:05:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have access to that lounge... I didn't check if it was priority pass or not because we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3939" target="_blank">01:05:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">had access from our boarding passes. But if it is worth... I wouldn't say worth spending time in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but if you have time, worth stopping by. Yeah, I would agree. It was definitely large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and somewhat sterile from a feeling perspective, but it wasn't crowded. And there was a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty wide assortment of food and drinks. So if you need to load up before your flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3962" target="_blank">01:06:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a good place to do it. Yeah. So quick review of Condor Airlines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3967" target="_blank">01:06:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I thought it was a budget airline. I'm not convinced it's a budget airline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3970" target="_blank">01:06:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually felt like a pretty legit airline. We got a meal on our short flight to Zurich.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqrWs9uhAU&t=3978" target="_blank">01:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was not a chaotic boarding process. Big fan. Would fly Condor again.
