Things have been pretty good. In 1900, 6% of teenagers graduated high school in the US. Now, that doesn't mean that 94% didn't have an education that we would regard as a high school education, but it like kind of means that, it roughly means that.</p><p>It's also the case that a high school education meant something lesser than. A substantial fraction of high schoolers now study AP courses and complete them in high school. That's at the high end. On the low end, illiteracy was a very live situation a hundred years ago in the US and is emphatically not now.</p><p>Now, it is the case that something like 10 to 15% of adults, depending on which polls you use, would struggle to perform like simple kinds of number manipulation or reading or writing kind of tasks. But our bar is basically moved. It used to be like, can you read it all?</p></div></div></body></html>
