class="t">Thank you for coming back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot has happened in the last five years since we had you on the podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But for listeners who are not familiar with you, I wanted to talk a little bit about your past and how you got to where you are today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You were raised on a cattle ranch in Colorado.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I assume you're a vegetarian?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'm all vegan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I'm a big fan of steaks and old school stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And you went to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where you graduated magna cum laude in 2002 with a bachelor's of science degree in economics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And from there, you took the University of Chicago Booth School of Business to get a PhD right out of undergrad, which is unusual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so it's definitely unusual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But what happened, I was basically serving as the data monkey slash programmer for the Wharton Finance Department.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of them were Chicago PhDs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And through that process, they highly recommend that I go for it because they thought they could get me in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And they said, hey, you get paid to go to school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You should do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the time, I didn't know any better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It seemed like a good idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of how I got pushed in that direction is I had a bunch of professors suggesting that I go that route.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What would you say, once you got there to the University of Chicago, you were probably one of the youngest PhD students there, I would assume.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And how many others were there right out of undergrad?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I was definitely the youngest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think there were any others that were right out of undergrad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I was 21 or 22.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And most of the others were married or had a kid or had actually done something in their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was a little bit awkward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I definitely felt like a fish out of water there with respect to experience and life knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And you did your first two years there basically banging your head against the wall, trying to get up to speed, if you will, 15 hours a day of study, seven days a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you needed a break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And was it some of the people that you spoke with, some of the fellow PhD students who had been in the military, were they talking with you about the military?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What made you decide to go into the Marine Corps?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had always wanted to do the service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem was just timing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Originally, I was going to do it after high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And my parents were like, well, you should go to college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, all right, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I got into college, so I started doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after college, I was thinking, okay, now I should go to the Marines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But then I got into the PhD program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's just a matter of like, I either got to do this now or it's never going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And just by serendipity at the time in my program, I'm guessing at least half the people in that program are former military officers, either from like, you know, Nordic countries or Israel or China even.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I mentioned this, like, hey, I might take a sabbatical, you know, they're actually like, oh, yeah, of course you should do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes, because I'm the only American in the entire program, I think, in my group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're like, well, of course you should do the service and serve your country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's totally logical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, unfortunately, depending on your perspective, probably my mom's, I had a reinforcing situation within the PhD class at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you went in the Marine Corps, became an officer, and you ended up in Japan, correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I got my sabbatical approved for extended for four years as opposed to one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And another lucky thing there is my PhD director was actually, her husband was a former Navy chief, so she was very amiable to the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had a lot of stars aligned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Fama, I had to get him to sign off, you know, Professor Fama.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's also kind of a

had everything lined up to allow me to do this weird funky move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you're right, I got in, you know, spent like a year and a half kind of pipeline training, then started off in Japan.</span></div><div

to Iraq, where you would be embedded with the Iraqi soldiers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=414"

the intel officer, so my job on the team was to kind of be the person that could communicate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, as you probably recognize, if you live with only Iraqis that don't speak English, and you get tired of doing hand motions, it kind of behooves you to just put in a serious investment to learn the language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=446"

experience in Iraq.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I was

target="_blank">00:08:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The point on this is you're a smart guy, and there's a lot of other smart guys, smart women all over the place, everywhere, Ph.D.s, brilliant

is taxes and fees and the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you know, to beat the market, at least in a short-term sense, because everyone wants to try to beat the quarter numbers, that's impossible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And usually you're going to overpay it in fees and taxes to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so I don't think you disagree, but I do believe that there are ways to beat the market in a long-term sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=562"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to have to be painful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to have to take more risk, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And you've still got to worry about keeping the fees down and keeping the taxes down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, it's all for

talk about that for a minute, because you left the University of Chicago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">When you were going to become an academic, in fact, you got hired by Drexel University.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

was working on his PhD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And his dissertation was about, is value investing a behavioral phenomena or a risk phenomena?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'm, well, I'll let you explain what that means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, as you know, there's these huge debates, which in some sense are worthless from an investment standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But academics like to debate whether the reason value beats, quote, unquote, the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that because of additional risk, like fundamental risk?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it because mispricing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">People throw the baby out the bathwater.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This company's a loser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's no good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just because of behavioral issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it because it's just fundamentally riskier?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, no one will ever settle this debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just be clear on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm of the opinion that it's probably a mix of both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think Jack's paper and a lot of the other papers related to this, more and more, I think it's hard to argue that behavioral issues and mispricing is not at least one component or at least more than half of a component of what drives factors like momentum and value in particular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there's been a lot of papers written about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But since those papers have been published, there's even faster computers and more PhDs and more mathematicians that are in the industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">My guest's last program was Larry Suedro.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He wrote a book called The Incredible Shrinking Alpha.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Where he makes the case that it's even harder now than it was 20 years ago to beat the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think it's even getting harder now to call it behavioral, given the fact that 90% of trading in the marketplace is institutional?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually think it might be the opposite, weirdly enough, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the issues with behaviors usually has to do with short-termism and corporate boards and weird governance structures where, for example, if you go to like the quote-unquote smart money, they're always going to have a three-year mandate to beat the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you don't beat the market, you present that to the board who has CYA issues, and you're going to get fired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if your benchmark is beat the market over three-year periods, well, that's actually very constraining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Because as you know, most factor phenomena, they work on 10-year cycles or 15-year cycles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Or 25-year cycles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or 25-year cycles, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the more information people have, the more ability they can check on how you're doing every second, and the more data, the more transparency, I think it actually forces the behavioral to be worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because now people, unfortunately, have more information to grasp on, and the frictional cost of transacting is basically free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you have more information, you have more data, you have lower frictional cost to action, it's kind of what Jack Bogle, the B version, the really famous one, used to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the problem is the ability to trade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why did he hate ETFs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you can trade

fundamentally bad, but the fact that I'm allowing you to potentially do something stupid makes you worse at investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think all the world is set up now is to make people terrible at investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, Robinhood, there's so many

that are tied to tracking error and just the pain of sticking with something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=832"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, interesting perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So you and Jack started Alpha Architect in 2010, and you began implementing quantitative strategies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">By this time, you weren't trying to pick stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you started launching exchange-traded funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let me ask there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did you decide to go with exchange-traded funds rather than mutual funds?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just knew a lot about finance back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not rich.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't really know that much about taxes or fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It just wasn't in my psyche.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But the seed investor that we worked with was a multi-billionaire, and they had spent 30 years paying more fees than anybody to all the hedge funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">They used to be the biggest hedge fund seeder in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And after 2008, they lived through that experience of like, wait a second, we paid $2.20, and you guys are also down 30%, and you won't even give us our money back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Your taxes are terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had kind of a kumbaya moment at that stage where they're like, this is not the way, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We need to get efficient, transparent, control, all the good stuff that Bogleheads love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was heavily influenced by that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we learned about the ETF structure, and to be frank, it's basically a massive tax deferral structure in plain sight, and we're doing active strategies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">One plus one equal three, and it made a lot of sense for us to move in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we're going to get into the tax advantages of ETFs here in a minute, which you've really excelled in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You ended up launching some ETFs, and most of them were factor ETFs, value, momentum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You started to get a name, and people started to give you money to invest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you started going down that path and learning also how to run an ETF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, we, at the time, whether it was good or bad, you know, we were like Marines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Pat was also my team's for a Marine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">As you know, it's all about do more with less and just find a way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, stupidly, we decided to build all the ETF infrastructure from the ground up out of my house, which I would not recommend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We did the path of let's build out the infrastructure and implement our own strategies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, we did that ever since the very beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, trading, compliance, reporting, a funny story is we actually, before, we raised a little capital after we got smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of my other partners and I were like, oh, how hard would it be to start an ETF?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">These prospective things and these exemptive reliefs, they sure look like they just Xeroxed them and changed the names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, before we got smart, we actually submitted, without any lawyers, our own exemptive relief and our own registration statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, literally, the SEC lady called us up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">She's like, did you guys submit this without, like, yourselves, without a lawyer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We're like, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">She's like, well, technically, you could do that, but that's not how this works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You guys need to hire a lawyer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We're like, oh, really?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and then we went back to the drawing board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we were total bootstrapped way back in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, over time, we've gotten smarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But, so, we tried to do everything ourselves, even get rid of the lawyers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But, lesson learned is that's impossible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, I got more lawyers I know what to do with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But, at the time, I was trying to avoid the lawyer situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I remember those days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember the first time I went to your office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, maybe it was 2012 or whenever it was, when you had first moved into your basement of your house, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're creating this company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It was really a cozy setting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But you built out this infrastructure for ETFs from the ground up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And you said, hey, let's invite other people who want to launch an ETF or maybe should launch an ETF because they believe in a particular strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's invite them to come in and use our platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that then created another business line for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, you're providing way too much value to our brain power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually fought that idea tooth and nail for many years because we were like, you know, we don't want to deal with other people's problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we just want to focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We're quant PhD geeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We do factor investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, we know how to do all the infrastructure and we do it cheaper than everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But we don't want to deal with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we got blessed because this lady, Perth Toll, who I'd known for many years, she had talked to everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And she just did not want to work with anyone else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And she kept, you know, basically beating our door down and like slamming us on the face like, you guys should do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You guys should do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, you know, kicking and screaming, we said, all right, whatever, let's try it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I don't even want to portray that this was like some grand genius idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This was all serendipity and luck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And we started with Perth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from there, we kept getting like one or two people that learned that we were going to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Still kicking and screaming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we were just doing this very, very selectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then just over time, because we kept getting people call us and say, hey, how do we give you money?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We thought, well, you know, if people, you know, want to keep giving us money to do this, we must be on to something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we quickly like started hiring, professionalizing, and then created what is now what they call ETF Architect, which is just, you know, A to Z ETF operations for the marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But the history of that was not genius.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It was, we stumbled into this, what is now basically a goldmine type business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I know Perth told personally, I remember when the ETF was launched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">She's very persistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Her ETF is the Freedom 100.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is basically an emerging market fund that leaves out restrictive regimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all about freedom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So economic freedom, personal freedom, which obviously you and I, like, I just love the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Just from a marine perspective, not maybe investing, you could argue different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, effectively, that's what it's doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And she's, to your point, she has amazing persistence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's her, and she has an $800 million of assets, her, out there telling the story of like, hey, you should deploy freedom concepts in emerging markets, because freer societies, freer economies generally grow faster and, you know, have property rights, which is kind of important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, if you avoid Russia and China over the past three or four years, her thesis was 100% correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, she's done very well for herself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but I remember, I recall it was really slow at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had some conversations, Perth and I, about, you know, what if this doesn't work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm so happy that it actually worked out for her, and that she has almost a billion under management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great news.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so now, here's where the real story, in my view, the reason why I really wanted you back today, besides to talk to you, because you're an overall nice guy and very smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, you ever get tired of being called very smart?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">No, don't, it gets counteracted with my kids and my wife, telling them I'm an idiot every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I need to balance it out a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm still way in deficit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You went to, I'll call it an extreme, and I'm glad you did, on ETFs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you figured out that, wow, there is an awful lot of benefit to the ETF structure from a tax standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, walk me through the history of how you began to realize this, and what it has become.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, going way back, most of our initial clients, well, all of our initial clients were real estate investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And what do real estate investors do, and how do they get so rich?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, they never pay taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They do 1031 exchanges, take properties, roll them into new properties, and they keep punting the can down the road.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you do that for 20, 30 years, you obviously have a massive tax liability in the end, but you're able to compound on pre-tax dollars, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, all of my experience was hanging around folks that were incredibly wealthy and always emphasize tax minimization is how you get rich.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that was just buried in my brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, way back now, like 10, 15 years ago, I was at some rich people thing with one of our big clients, and this lady started telling me about the ETF structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And she walked through custom rebalancing, how it all works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm like, so wait a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what you're saying is if I put my money in an ETF, I never have to distribute capital gains effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">She's like, yeah, you know, you rebalance, you custom baskets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, well, that seems like a huge deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's where it kind of started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, rolling forward, as you know, like before the ETF, the new ETF rule, it was unclear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, index funds had this advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Some firms like Vanguard and iShares had it on active funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It was unclear, like, who could use what they call custom crate redemption, which has basically allowed us, you know, swap out securities and not have to pay taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's just step back and just walk through, like, a very oversimplified example of a one-stock fund in either an ETF or a mutual fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's just say, again, this is way oversimplified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not exactly correct, but just for the audience's purposes, let's say this fund owns Microsoft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Buy it at a dollar, and it goes to $100.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're like, you know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't like Microsoft anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to go buy Exxon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what happens?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in a mutual fund, we sell Microsoft, and we're going to also get a $99 capital gain, and then we take the $100 of cash and go buy Exxon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">In an SMA or a separately managed account, same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If you DIY in your broker account, same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">If you do it in a hedge fund, an LP, same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">All of those concepts that we just talked about, the mutual fund, the separately managed account, hedge funds, they all have to realize the capital gain in the account, and investors have to pay taxes on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Whenever you have a realization event, you know, obviously that is taxable distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, now you're going to have to pay taxes at the end of that year on that gain or what have you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the ETF, also, if you did that exact transaction and you sold Microsoft to cash, it's just like a mutual fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We would also have a huge capital gain distribution out to the shareholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">However, ETFs have a unique ability to transact in kind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't have to transact in cash-settled transactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">What we can do, and again, to just oversimplify it, is basically we want to get rid of Microsoft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's put that in a custom basket, deliver out the security.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not going to sell the security.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to exchange, basically, the Microsoft security and then use what they call an authorized participant to deliver in cash or, in this case, Exxon, a security.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are non-taxable transactions because they're done in-time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would that be non-taxable, Wes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have the Microsoft anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I've given it to this third party, so it's not in my account anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But why is that not taxable?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.380</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:28:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, we received an Exxon, and let's say it was $100.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The basis on Exxon is $100.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So what the ETF has done is it's tax-efficiently rebounds from Microsoft to Exxon,

going to pay your tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And eventually,

get a compound tax deferred until you sell the actual ETF structure itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I got some question about losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, not every stock you buy go up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have a loss in a mutual fund, they could sell it at a loss, and they can offset some gains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">In an ETF, do you sell losses and exchange out gains?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We do, not because you really have to, but it just builds efficiency in the fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, if I can always get rid of gains through redemptions, that's obviously a good idea for shareholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I have a natural loser that I want to get rid of, why wouldn't I sell that to bank a bunch of tax?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We call it tax loss insurance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So then maybe I don't have to do a custom in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Or let's say a company announces like, hey, we're doing a cash offer on this stock you own, and it's going to happen tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to have a little bit of insurance there so I don't have to quickly do a custom rebounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1785"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also, just because I don't know if other people do this, this is what we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm just always concerned about the government and the long game, because they've already proposed eliminating it 52B6 before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just try to accumulate and bank as many losses as humanly

<span class="t">So now we're going to go to a product that you created, probably a product that has the most amount of assets in it, and you only created it about a year and a half ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called the Alpha Architect

target="_blank">00:30:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, on the Bogleheads Forum, this has 50,000 views and pages and pages of comments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably one of the biggest discussed items on the Bogleheads Forum in the last

class="t">So first of all, tell us what it is and how you use these trades to create a tax-efficient money market fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing, Wes, before you answer, I need to say this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be making a lot of comments about taxes, but Wes, you're not going to be commenting about taxes specifically related to this fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And perhaps you could start by explaining why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of our core beliefs is transparency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">However, when it comes to box, I always tell people it's like Fight Club.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The first rule of box club is we cannot talk about taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason for that is to protect shareholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I will tell you about box spreads, and I'll tell you about the ability, if you don't have distributions in a RIC, obviously you have a capability to compound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there's this rule called Section 1258, which talks about discussing the taxation of certain transactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we just basically do not want to talk about tax in general on this thing because it's in the best interest of shareholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But that said, the box is basically something that's been around for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's essentially a way to extract funding rates out of the option markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What I mean by that is whenever you buy or sell options, they're implicitly leveraged positions, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like obviously a call option is very different than just buying VOO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And VOO is the Vanguard S&P 500.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens is like if you just buy VOO versus buy a call option, obviously the call option, you can effectively get the upside benefit of a stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We only have to post a little bit of capital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's, long story short, there's embedded leverage and option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what a box spread does functionally is you do two option positions that create what they call a synthetic long position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you buy a call and you sell a put at the same strike, it effectively replicates the payoff profile of a stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that's one leg of a box spread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The second leg of a box spread is to create a synthetic short position in the stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And what are you going to do there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2008" target="_blank">00:33:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to buy a put and sell a call on the same strike.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And intuitively, if one creates a synthetic long position and a synthetic short position, you have effectively eliminated market risk, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2025" target="_blank">00:33:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you're long and short, the same asset, you don't have risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the context of the option markets, if a position is fully hedged like this would be, what is it going to deliver?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the box spread is going to deliver the payoff and the difference of the strike prices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I create the synthetic long position with, say, a strike price of $100 and I create the synthetic short position at a strike price of $200, that option box will deliver $100 guaranteed in, say, three months from now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So anytime in the marketplace, if we all know from market efficiency, where you have an opportunity to get a $100 payoff guaranteed three months from now, it's obviously not going to be selling for $10 or $20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably going to be selling for $99 or $99.5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to be arbitraged very closely to effectively Fed funds rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, you're teasing out, say, a T-bill rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember that when I was in the brokerage industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2090" target="_blank">00:34:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I never did a box spread, but they used to talk about it all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">In the morning call, they would talk about the cost of doing a box spread on any particular day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a very routine transaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's not new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">This transaction has been around for decades, like you said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's widely known to tease out the T-bill rate from doing these box spreads on options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But you have taken this concept and you put it in an ETF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So we basically took what is effectively an institutional money management trading funding trade and thought, why don't we put this in the ETF?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One, generally box spreads have a premium over equivalent duration bills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So this funding spread, it's a limit of arbitrage problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, what you're going to get is like Fed funds plus, say, 25 to 50 bips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that 30 to 40 bips means 0.3 to 0.4 percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2142" target="_blank">00:35:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the Fed funds rates was five, then your borrowing costs would be 5.3, 5.4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I know you throw out a lot of jargon here, but the bottom line with the box spread is you're going to get, if you're a buyer of a box spread,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">probably a little bit more than the three-month T-bill rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you're going to charge a fee for putting it in an ETF, and I think your fee is 0.2 percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the net result is an expectation of a T-bill return to an investor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we've beaten it a little bit, which is our goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can do in-kind creation and redemption just like you can in an ETF with stocks and bonds, only doing it with options now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's a stock and you send it out in a basket to be exchanged for another stock, you don't have capital gain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2196" target="_blank">00:36:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the way it is with options as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know you can't comment on this, but I will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That creates almost like a money market fund that doesn't pay out interest or capital gains, but just grows in value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then me as an investor decides when I'm going to pay my capital gain by selling shares in the ETF, which is really interesting to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It should be especially interesting to people who have had a realized capital loss in their portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2227" target="_blank">00:37:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You can only write off $3,000 against your ordinary income every year unless you have capital gains, and this creates a very steady stream of potential capital gains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I know you can't comment on any of that, but that's just me as an advisor thinking, now, how would I use this product?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to comment on any of the characterizations of the taxation, but the one thing I can comment on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and what I can say that our objective is to achieve is we are attempting to not distribute anything to the extent they were able in that particular fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's something we want to do is we don't want to impose people with any sort of distributions of any kind of characterization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Before jumping off this topic, I will state the other side of the coin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2273" target="_blank">00:37:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That is that there is an opposing view on how the gains in BOXX should be taxed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Many of the posts on Bogleheads are about this very topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2284" target="_blank">00:38:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Some notable academics believe that it should be taxed as ordinary income and not capital gain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So my advice is to consult your tax advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let's move on to the next topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Direct indexing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One of my favorite things to talk about with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">This has become a popular, separately managed account sold by advisors, asset management companies, brokerage firms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And I emphasize the word sold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Direct indexing is you hire an asset management company to go out and buy hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of individual stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then manage that portfolio to an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But if there's a loss in any particular stock, they would sell one stock or two stocks, take the loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2338" target="_blank">00:38:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you could use those losses to offset gains that you may have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you sold stock that had a gain or a business that had a gain or real estate that had a gain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is one of the uses for a separately managed account or direct indexing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one would be you have a big position in a particular company and you want to build around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one would be you have an ESG mandate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So you want to, you know, eliminate various stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are other reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But this reason, the one that I'm talking about, is a way to generate capital losses that can be used to offset a capital gain that either you took this year or you know you're going to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're going to build up these losses and then take the capital gain next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, did I say anything wrong about direct indexing, by the way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">No, you covered it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, anyway, I have an issue with this, and that is that, well, what do you do with this thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say you have a big capital gain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, you sell your business in January and you take the money and you put it into direct indexing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2397" target="_blank">00:39:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And you try to create as many losses as you can during that one tax year so that you can use the losses that you generate in direct indexing to offset the gain that you have in the sale of your business or the gain that you have in the sale of this big block of maybe one stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But the next year, it's done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2413"

brokers and the asset managers, they don't want you to get out of all of these stocks because they collect fees every single year on the management of this account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2439" target="_blank">00:40:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But you don't need all those capital losses anymore.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:40:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And my issue with direct indexing has always been there had to be an exit strategy from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the exit strategy could be, well, you take the stocks that went up and you give them to charity and all the rest of the stuff you just sell and liquidate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2459" target="_blank">00:40:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was one way of getting out of direct indexing and not having to pay evergreen fees and not have to pay who knows how much to CPAs to figure out what you owe in taxes every year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2469" target="_blank">00:41:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But you came up with a different way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.620</a></span> | <span

tax code, which is super exciting, I'm sure, for Vogel Heads, we're going to talk about this other tax code called Section 351.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">351 is a section of the code that says that you can seed or basically transfer assets into a C corporation and not incur a tax hit via that transaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And within 351, there's a specific regulation tied to funding RICs, which, as we discussed earlier, is what ETFs and mutual funds are taxed from an IRS standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2508" target="_blank">00:41:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what 351 allows you to do is it says, hey, you have this, let's say, you have this direct indexing portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You basically now have an overpriced index fund with no tax-loss harvesting opportunities and a lot of complication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We can transfer all that in to seed an ETF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once we get all this stuff back into the ETF structure, we can be tax deferral forever, clean it up, fees or tax deductible again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It just went back to the Vanguard model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a way to solve the complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So just so they understand, I can have this portfolio of hundreds of stocks and I could take it and I could turn it into your company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2550" target="_blank">00:42:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'll get in return is one ETF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not the only one who's turning in stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there might be 50 people who are doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're collecting all of these portfolios out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And there may be private investors who have portfolios of a lot of stock that they want to create an ETF on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So everybody turns all their stock into Alpha Architect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And you then issue from all of that one ETF.</span></div><div class="c"><span

what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=3250" target="_blank">00:54:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, no, it's not for

it's very compelling because by nature, like, you're used to deployments and, like, uprooting yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that's usually the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwEm8HiEYs&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, most people, they do the math, and they're like, oh, my God, I'm going to get
