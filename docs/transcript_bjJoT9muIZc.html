I'm thrilled to change that word to tenacity or grit or work ethic. I'm incredibly self-aware that the way I communicate with the excitement level, with the energy, with the Jersey chat of it, I'm very genuinely compassionate and understanding to why people may take the extreme take.</p><p>And I also don't have the audacity. I deploy enormous humility when I'm about to say what I'm saying. I would never expect someone to spend five hours to double-click into it and actually understand what I'm about and what I'm saying. I guess at the end of the day, what are they missing?</p><p>They're not missing anything if they're just doing a drive-by and reading a headline. If they've spent two or three hours on me through content or interaction or people that really know me, I doubt they'd be missing anything because I think they would</p></div></div></body></html>
