If you think about, you know, early humans, you had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to move in order to go seek out the water or the meat or whatever it was. And even in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">most primitive organisms, dopamine is released when food is sensed in the environment. For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">example, C. elegans, a very primitive worm. So dopamine is this really powerful, important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">molecule in the brain that helps us experience pleasure.

And if you want to think about something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">most people don't know about dopamine, which I think is really interesting is that we are always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">releasing dopamine at a kind of tonic baseline rate. And it's really the deviation from that baseline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than like hits of dopamine in a vacuum that make a difference. So when we experience pleasure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">our dopamine release goes above baseline. And likewise, dopamine can go below that tonic baseline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we experience a kind of pain. Interesting. So is it fair to say that one's baseline levels of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">dopamine, how frequently we are releasing dopamine in the absence of some, I don't know, drug or food or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">experience just sitting, being, is that associated with how happy somebody is, their kind of baseline of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">happiness or level of depression? There is evidence that shows that people who are depressed may indeed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">have lower tonic levels of dopamine. So that's a really reasonable thought. And there's some evidence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to suggest that that may be true. The other thing that we know, and this is, you know, really kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what, what the book is about, is that if we expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine in our brain's reward pathway, that we can change our tonic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">baseline and actually lower it over time as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which is more really than we were designed to, to experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. And is it would, is it, um, the case that our baseline levels of dopamine are set by our genetics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">by our heredity?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think, you know, if you think about sort of, you know, the early stages of development in infancy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">certainly that is true. You're kind of, you know, born with probably whatever is your baseline level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but obviously your experiences can have a huge impact on where your, your dopamine level ultimately settles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">out. So, um, if somebody's disposition is one of, um, constant excitement and anticipation or easily excited,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">these are, I think about the kind of people where you say, "Hey, do you want to check out this new place for tacos?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're like, "Yeah, that'd be great." And other people are, um, a little more cynical, harder to budge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like my bulldog Costello, um, very, very stable, low levels of dopamine with big inflections in his case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, is that, do you think that's a set in terms of, um, our parents and obviously nature and nurture interact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but is that, is dopamine at the core of our temperament?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't really think we know the answer to that, but I will say that people are definitely born</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with different temperaments and those temperaments do affect their ability to experience joy. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and, you know, we've known that for a long time and we described that in many different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the ways that we describe that in the modern era is to use psychiatric nomenclature,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like this person has a dysthymic temperament, or, you know, this person has chronic major depressive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">disorder. Um, in terms of looking specifically at who's vulnerable to addiction, um, that's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting sort of mixed bag because when you look at, uh, the research on risk factors for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">addiction, so what kind of temperament, uh, of a person makes them more vulnerable to addiction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you see, um, some interesting findings. First, you see that people who are more impulsive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are more vulnerable to addiction. So what is impulsivity? That means having difficulty, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">putting space between the thought or desire to do something and actually doing it. And people who have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">difficulty putting a space there who are, who have a thought to do something and just do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">impulsively are people who are more vulnerable to addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. Could I, uh, in terms of impulsivity, is this something that relates literally to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">um, the startle reflex? Like I, for instance, as a, uh, lab director, I'm familiar with walking around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">my lab. And, um, when I decide deciding I'm going to talk to my people, of course, when they knock on my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">door, it's always like, wait, why am I being bothered right now? Even though I love to talk to them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but I walk around my lab from time to time and some people I notice I'll say, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">do you have a moment?

Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that related to impulsivity or is what you're referring to, um, an attempt to, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">withhold behavior that's very deliberate under very deliberate conditions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So I don't think that that startle reflex is, is necessarily related to impulsivity. That,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that can be related to anxiety.

Impulsivity is a little bit different. And by the way, impulsivity is not always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bad, right?

Um, you know, there can be a sort of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, let's say intimate, um, interactions between people where you wouldn't really want to be super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">inhibited about it. Right. You would want to be disinhibited and, and impulsive. Um, there, I can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like imagine like sort of, um, fight or flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right. Where, where it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really be good to be impulsive and just go, rah, you know, just where hesitation can cost you your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLf-95pkF0&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, that's right.
