nothing wrong with that overhead when you're looking at a particular thing you're trying to accomplish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

increase the number of things on your plate, the amount of overhead being brought by each thing is the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

overhead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to answer the emails

target="_blank">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it paradoxically, or some might say cruelly, squeezes away the time required to actually do the work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the pragmatic limitation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The more things you have, the more this overhead, which is useful but does not directly produce value, dominates your schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the amount of literal time left to convert in the value is greatly reduced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those two factors are negative impacts on your ability to produce value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are also positive impacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we said here's the negative of doing too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's positive impacts on doing less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is something that we intuit but we don't often capture precisely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is if you're looking at a particular pursuit project or activity, the value of what you produce is going to grow nonlinearly with the time you put into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, doubling the time you put into a particular creative project doesn't necessarily just double the value produced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It might significantly more increase that value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it turns out there's these discontinuous jumps in the value of what you're doing as you cross certain thresholds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a discontinuous jump as you move, for example, past the amateur threshold in almost any creative pursuit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once what you're producing is no longer just, "Oh, I kind of did something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is sort of just an amateur effort and actually has a professional polish," which takes more time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it significantly jumps up in its potential value to the marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's another discontinuous jump that happens when you push something to the level that it becomes remarkable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which I mean in the literal sense that now you've added something that's so novel, innovative, or well done that it actually leads people to remark,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, look at that. That's interesting." It catches people's attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something with that attribute jumps up to another level in value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of that requires time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the more time you put into things, you jump past the amateur level, then you jump past to the remarkable level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you get this significant, profound increase in the value of what you are producing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And these effects can also be seen through a market analogy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Essentially, the more time you put on something, the more aggressively you essentially pare away the other people who could produce the same level of quality of what you just produced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as that market gets smaller and smaller, your value jumps up much higher as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what this all comes down to is that if you have less things on your plate, you can spend more time on the things that remain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Spending more time on the things that remain will generate much more value than if you instead spread that same time over many more things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is mathematical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If value increases non-linearly with time spent, your best strategy is to put as much time as possible on the fewest number of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just pure mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's, again, let's make this real concrete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're writing something, spending almost all your time working on making that thing you're writing really well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so I don't know, you have 20 hours to spend a week, spending all 20 hours on that is in the end probably going to produce way more value than if you instead spend five hours on that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">five hours on something else, five hours on something else, and then five individual hours on five small things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't just take the value of these smaller investments and add them up and get the same as what you would get if you put all that time into the one thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because when you put all your time to the one thing, you leap past the levels you were before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we got negative and positive reasons that tell us less is better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You do too much, all these negative things happen to drag you down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You do less, all these positive impacts happen that push up even more the value you produce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this is the situation we're in right now in our current world, especially in the American economic scene,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where we have this very large knowledge sector that emphasizes skilled employees with great autonomy to individually produce value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's so many people who now fall within that type of economic context, and in that situation, almost certainly doing less is better, and no one does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of the pressure is towards, can't you just do a little more? Can't you answer one more email? Can't you be on one more Zoom call?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is chaos. It is the Wild West when it comes to how we handle work today, and because of that, we're leaving a lot of value on the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to leave it there, but it is the point I want to make is that we can move beyond simply arguing doing less is good for the human soul.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Doing more is just the rapacious objective of marauding capitalists. That might be true, but we have this other piece of ammo to use as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is actually doing less also produces more value. So it not just makes us happier, not just makes work more sustainable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it actually increases the value we are able to produce, which makes us again happier.

It's very influential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2881" target="_blank">00:48:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very influential because it it came out during this postwar doldrums period where people were adrift and moving to suburbs and getting boring jobs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this book of reinvention and focusing on depth and values in a radical way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a clear example of my notion of the deep life in action really struck a chord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I figured I needed to read it because so much more that's recent is informed by it, whether the author's note or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about before because I tried to read it on Kindle and I was like, nah, this book can't be read on Kindle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I need a hardcover. But instead of just like a normal person buying a hardcover, I went back and bought a first edition, first printing from 1948 of the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it really mattered. I think it really helped. I think it really changed my experience of reading the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2927" target="_blank">00:48:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a long one. It's 400 something pages in the original hardcover, which are wide pages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they didn't mess around with this sort of business book you buy in the airport in the 2000 and 20s, you know, double spaced lines and giant fonts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't mess around with that back in the 40s. You know, people had time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the lines are the lines are small. So it took me a while to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm really glad I did. I'm really glad I did. I know more about Catholic practice now than I ever have before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I recommend it. It is the it's a foundational book that so many more self-transformation books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all the big self-transformation books that fall in 20th centuries were informed by Seven Story Mountain. And he's a good writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So speaking about writing, I then went on to read Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I had never read that. No, I had read the other famous writing instruction books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Bird by Bird, if you don't know, is Anne Lamott's book about writing. It's a book about writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, because, as you might expect, I've internalized the patriarchy, I had read Stephen King's book on writing on writing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">probably because of the the male gendered gaze was more comfortable for me than the the female gaze or what have you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3003" target="_blank">00:50:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But for whatever reason, I had never read Bird by Bird. But it is right up there with Stephen King's on writing as one of the two most famous nonfiction books about writing from the last whatever, three or four decades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I like Anne Lamott. I mean, I like her writing. I like her as a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Person, just her excuse me, like just her approach to life, she lives and she's had an interesting, difficult life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And she I always go. Deep stalker mode on the houses of writers, and so she bought this cool piece of land in northern California that was kind of run down and they slowly converted over time into this like oasis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I love that type of stuff. The book is good. It's focused on fiction writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll say the main thing I came away with, other than Anne Lamott is a great writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3057" target="_blank">00:50:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the main thing I came away with is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Fiction writing. I think attracts more aspiring writers than nonfiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because on paper. Becoming a success seems easier, and what I mean by that is when you read Bird by Bird or you read Stephen King's book and you read about novel writing, the only real activity you do is sit down at a computer and write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's all about that, like just sitting down there and writing and overcoming the psychological fears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in theory. If you've never written anything before, you have all of the tools and things you need to potentially write a great novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You just have to sit down there and write where nonfiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Excuse me. Seems more scary, right? It's like I got to get a book deal first. You don't write nonfiction before you get the book. I got to go actually talk to people. I got to do interviews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it seems harder. But you the reality is when you read something like Bird by Bird is like, oh, my God, fiction so much harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, yeah, yeah, you can just get going. But man, it's just you in the screen and you have to just craft out of nowhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These characters and narratives that reveal the human experience and do so with perfect craft because any deviation from perfect craft is going to ring out where nonfiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. You just have to be competent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have something to read about. I did research on it. If I just do the work to do the research, I know how to write in a way that's not going to annoy people like you can be in the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this is the the allure of National Novel Writing Month and fiction writing and Bird by Bird is like maybe if I just sit there at the keyboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, of Mice and Men is going to come out. But I think it's way harder. So I'm glad I'm not a fiction writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That just seems like it's impossible. It's like trying to be a screenwriter. Everyone's like, I bet I could do that because I know movies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I movie seems straightforward and it's impossible. It's impossible to actually like write because everyone can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But to do it well, it's like near impossible. So it's a good book. Makes me glad I'm a nonfiction writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to all you aspiring writers out there, nonfiction is actually a way. It's way easier, in my opinion, to like be a working writer than in fiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Then I went on and read some fiction because April had some good weather and good weather.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I like to have fun books to read. So I went and read the Carl Sagan novel Contact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which actually I really enjoyed. So it was a premise of the book was it focused on someone at SETI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">S E T I search for extraterrestrial intelligence. And Carl Sagan works through what would happen if we actually did get a signal from an alien civilization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3224" target="_blank">00:53:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the parts I like the best actually is he works through the science of how that would work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, OK, it would be a signal on this frequency that corresponds to the emission frequency of hydrogen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there would be pulses corresponding to the prime numbers because that'd be really universal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they're using various modulation screens to encode information into those into those symbols.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I thought that was real interesting. I really love the part where he got in whenever you get into the science of like how alien communication would work and and how we would track it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I love those parts, but there was pretty good characters as well. I mean, it was a good book. And I love when scientists write books and they're good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3272" target="_blank">00:54:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only nerd comment I need to make my apologies to the Sagan estate. Actually, no apologies. It's not his fault.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3280" target="_blank">00:54:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just is a demonstration of how things have changed. So the book takes place like in 99.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he gets wrong. He gets right. A lot of things. He didn't get the Internet right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had instead these like portable fax machines they would carry around that like would send messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They would like send and receive messages through portable fax machines like he wasn't quite there on the Internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But but, you know, it was pretty close. But the small nerd detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That I noticed is the aliens used for one of the layers of encoding in their signal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3317" target="_blank">00:55:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Phase modulation. And in the book, Sagan's like, oh, we don't phase modulation is something that theoretically could do, but it's not something that we use really in like human devices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We know about it, but it's just not something we're used to. Based on my understanding, phase modulation is actually now heavily used in wireless data protocols, like in particular in 802.11 protocols for access points like phase modulations at the core of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was a prediction that was gotten wrong in the age of Wi-Fi phase modulation as well used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm doing here, Jesse, is I'm giving the people the information they really care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3357" target="_blank">00:55:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you cut past the superfluous and you focus in on what is it that the crowds really care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I look, if there's one thing I will say about Deep Questions listeners, they are RF modulation, RF modulation fans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you got us primed up for your comments about Jurassic Park a couple months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3378" target="_blank">00:56:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, that's right.

So, again, no one cares about this. I'm mainly a theoretician, but I do theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I used to do theory about problems that were motivated by wireless networks. So for my postdoc, for my two years as a postdoc at MIT,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd left the theory group and I went up to the network and mobile systems group and learned a lot about how wireless network technology actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there you go. It finally paid off in allowing me to do an awesome, cool critique of Carl Sagan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to say that makes his book a garbage book, but, you know, you're going to get modulation wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I don't know, guys, I don't know what we're doing here.

I'm a big Tony Horwitz booster. He died a few years ago, like at the age of 60.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3453" target="_blank">00:57:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just tragic, just like heart attack, just boom, streets of D.C., you know, fickle finger of fate, which was really tragic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Fascinating guy.

So he married Geraldine Brooks, the novelist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When he married her, he had a Pulitzer.

He's on these islands you've never heard of meeting these characters who he who capture so interestingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like the the life on these islands and the impact of colonialism, et cetera, written beautifully and just interleaving with the story of Captain Cook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3554" target="_blank">00:59:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Great book, but long.

So I was surprised by how long that took.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The final book I read. It's a bit of an odd one. This is a deep hole. Uncle Petros and Gold Blocks Conjecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As a long process by which I came to this book, it is a novel written by a mathematician, a Greek mathematician named Apostolos Doxiatis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So between this and Sagan, as you can see, I'm on a kick of scientists writing books about their field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the book is about it's like a young boy and his uncle and his uncle was like this super math prodigy who became obsessed with trying to solve Gold Box Conjecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3607" target="_blank">01:00:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which was at the time one of the three big famous number theory conjectures that hadn't been solved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Riemann hypothesis, Fermat's last theorem and the Gold Block Conjecture. Fermat's has since been proven by Andrew Wiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3622" target="_blank">01:00:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Was the Riemann solved? Can you look that up, Jesse? The Riemann hypothesis. I have this vague memory of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3630" target="_blank">01:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought. R-E-I-M-A-N-N. I have this vague memory of this, this eccentric mathematician, George or Goreg or something, solved it and didn't even show up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3642" target="_blank">01:00:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I might be thinking about something different. So you have to fact check me on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyways, Wikipedia says many consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics in the first paragraph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3652" target="_blank">01:00:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what did he oh, look up. I think he solved Poincare's conjecture. P-O-I-N-C-A-R-E. Accent a goo. Conjecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe that's what he he solved. The guy I'm thinking about. So Jesse's going to fact check that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3679" target="_blank">01:01:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Maybe that's what it was. Originally conjectured by Henry Poincare in 1904,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the theorem conserves spaces that locally look like ordinary three dimensional space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Was it solved? Attempts to resolve the conjecture drove much progress in the field of geometric topology during the 20th century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a guy with whose name started with G who solved it. I'll keep on looking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Anyways, the point be there was something famous solved. The guy was this weird eccentric.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3709" target="_blank">01:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was Russian. And he didn't even show up for I think he got to give him like a Fields Medal or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3714" target="_blank">01:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't even show up. But it was this book was sort of about a character like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3719" target="_blank">01:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a math prodigy who became obsessed with solving this conjecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3724" target="_blank">01:02:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically his life fell apart because of that. And it is from the perspective of his son who kind of uncovers this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3733" target="_blank">01:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's cool. You know, it's it's a short book. The I wouldn't say there's a lot of sophisticated plot in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like long periods of just exposition of like, let me just tell you, let me just summarize my uncle story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it kind of just tells the story. But it's really cool because he puts in a lot of famous figures from logic and number theory and analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Turing plays a role. Kurt Gertle shows up in the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3758" target="_blank">01:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's hanging out with Rajana man and Hardy at Cambridge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3764" target="_blank">01:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's cool. It's like all these mathematical cameos. Not much really happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I love to see specialists in their fields write fiction about their fields because I want to do that one day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3776" target="_blank">01:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe that's why I was reading Sagan and Uncle Petros. You should have used your French accent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

articles as opposed to nonfiction books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4347" target="_blank">01:12:27.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:12:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is the formula to do something like that the same as you often share for nonfiction books?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4358" target="_blank">01:12:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By that I mean be the right person to write about that right topic, don't suck at writing, and have a solid and interesting idea?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4366" target="_blank">01:12:46.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4377" target="_blank">01:12:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a subtle distinction that you're asking about here.</span></div><div

one of the core points I make is that when it comes to nonfiction books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4390" target="_blank">01:13:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there is an insatiable demand for more product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4395" target="_blank">01:13:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For various economic reasons, the publishing houses need full pipelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4399" target="_blank">01:13:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They need lots of books moving through those pipelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4403" target="_blank">01:13:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we sometimes paint this picture of mustache-twirling gatekeepers who just don't understand your brilliance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4409" target="_blank">01:13:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have to somehow get around to get your book published.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4411" target="_blank">01:13:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They are desperate for books to publish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4414" target="_blank">01:13:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They need books in the pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to have a lot of books on the shelves just to make the economics of being a publisher work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4422" target="_blank">01:13:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So given that reality, it's a good situation for the aspiring nonfiction book writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4429" target="_blank">01:13:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I gave that three-point formula for becoming one that you just summarized there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4433" target="_blank">01:13:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to have an idea that people are going to feel like they need to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4436" target="_blank">01:13:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to be the right person to write that idea, and they need to write it in a way that's not going to raise flags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4441" target="_blank">01:14:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to be John McPhee, but you can't be amateur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4444" target="_blank">01:14:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just has to be professional writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4446" target="_blank">01:14:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you can find that idea for which you're the right person and you can write at a non-amateur level, which takes some work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4453" target="_blank">01:14:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but again, we're not talking about becoming John McPhee, you have a good shot of being able to publish a nonfiction book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4458" target="_blank">01:14:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean you're going to get paid a lot of money for it, but you have a good shot of doing it because there's an insatiable demand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4463" target="_blank">01:14:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's more slots, basically, to fill than they often have books to put into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4471" target="_blank">01:14:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Writing for a magazine, like writing for The New Yorker or writing op-eds for The New York Times, it's a different situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4481" target="_blank">01:14:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it switches from a seller's market to a buyer's market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4485" target="_blank">01:14:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not the same notion of we have an insatiable need for more and more product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4490" target="_blank">01:14:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually there's a limited number of slots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4492" target="_blank">01:14:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The New York Times only has so many op-ed slots per day, and half of those are going to editorial board members</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4498" target="_blank">01:14:58.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:15:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's very little space there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4503" target="_blank">01:15:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Same for a magazine like The New Yorker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4505" target="_blank">01:15:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's just only so many slots they have to fill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4509" target="_blank">01:15:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a different type of world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4512" target="_blank">01:15:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, getting into that world is going to require more than just I have an idea, I'm the right person to write it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4520" target="_blank">01:15:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can write it at a good level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually something else has to be involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4524" target="_blank">01:15:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of different paths into those worlds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4527" target="_blank">01:15:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people come into those worlds through specific expertise coupled with a good writing ability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4534" target="_blank">01:15:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might have someone like an Atul Gawande who has all of this medical expertise as a doctor who learned how to write really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4544" target="_blank">01:15:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, oh, that's really rare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4545" target="_blank">01:15:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And like The New Yorker would say, great, now we have this sort of distinctive expert insider voice on medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4552" target="_blank">01:15:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, that's one way into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4555" target="_blank">01:15:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have people like Gia Tolentino at The New Yorker who she just developed an incredibly original voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4562" target="_blank">01:16:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just sheer talent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4564" target="_blank">01:16:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they came knocking on her door at some point, like, this is just you have this voice that captures the mood of your generation in these times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4572" target="_blank">01:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's just sheer talent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4574" target="_blank">01:16:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, that's much harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4576" target="_blank">01:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we should just be honest about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4578" target="_blank">01:16:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, my experience with The New Yorker is they come to you, and I don't know if that's always the case for everyone there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4585" target="_blank">01:16:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it feels a little bit sometimes like the Yankees in the 90s, like, OK, yeah, good work, Rodriguez over there in the Rangers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4594" target="_blank">01:16:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can come play for us now because and everyone jumps at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4597" target="_blank">01:16:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a little bit of that. There's not much you can do to force that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4599" target="_blank">01:16:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I don't know if that's everyone's experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4601" target="_blank">01:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just the story I've heard from the writers I've talked to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4604" target="_blank">01:16:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">New York Times is kind of similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4607" target="_blank">01:16:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you end up doing op ed for The New York Times?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4609" target="_blank">01:16:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Often they're asking you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4611" target="_blank">01:16:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they've seen something else, things you've written, they know about you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4614" target="_blank">01:16:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're like, you know what, this person would have a good take on this topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4618" target="_blank">01:16:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's a lot of you being asked to do things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4622" target="_blank">01:17:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I don't think the right way into the world of nonfiction writing is not my first thing is to be a New Yorker writer or New York Times op ed writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Books are a great way in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4632" target="_blank">01:17:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Magazines or publications in which they actually have a content issue, they need more content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4638" target="_blank">01:17:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are a good way in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wI5rFN1SM&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Produce stuff, be so good you can't be ignored.</span></div><div class="c"><span
