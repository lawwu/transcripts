Bonus episode. Here we go. Yeah, so we're gonna do something a little different today. Wanted to sort of take a break from I don't know, talking about just different issues and things. And how are we describing this, Steven, we're calling, you know, how like MBR has a tiny desk concert.</p><p>Maybe we'll call it the Lifetime Table Concert because we're sitting at a Lifetime Table Concert. But yeah, we just wanted to, you know, both of us, we led praise. My career was very short. But yeah, and we like singing, we like worship. And I figured it would be good to kind of end this season by just taking it back to basics.</p><p>And by basics, I mean, just take it back to back to God, back to the gospel. Yeah, we've been talking about like church, we're gonna talk about our experiences, things like that, which has been good and has its place. But just felt like, man, we gotta, let's just bring it back to God.</p><p>Let's, let's sing to God. Let's praise Him. It's all about Him, right? Anyway, so we're gonna share a couple Bible verses and just play a couple songs. Yeah, so we each picked one verse and one song that we wanted to share. So you want to start us off, Stephen?</p><p>Yeah, so I picked 1 Peter 5:6-7. "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time He may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on Him because He cares for you." I chose this, I mean, recently I've been reading Humility by Andrew Murray, and that book always gets me, reminds me how proud I am, reminds me how arrogant I am, just thinking that I don't need God, thinking that my significance lies in what I do and how I perform and things like that.</p><p>And just thinking like, anything that humbles me, anything that reminds me that that's not it, that my fundamental posture to God is that I need Him, that my fundamental posture towards God is that I'm just made in His image, I'm just literally, I'm a reflection of Him, and that it's not about my performance, it's not about my significance found in what I produce, but it's just, I am a vessel, I am an instrument of God, right?</p><p>And just sort of aligning myself back to that reality, that that is the relationship between me and God. I'm just the creature, He's God, right? He's the Creator, and that gives me a lot of peace. That is what puts me in the place where I can cast all my anxieties on Him.</p><p>There's a lot of stress, a lot of worries in life, especially when you're church planting and stuff like that, but that's when I really realign back to that reality. I'm just the creature, and He's the Creator. Yeah, that's when I remember that God cares for me, and I can cast all my anxieties on Him.</p><p>And so that's why I chose the song that I chose, Same God by Elevation Worship. Yeah, it's just, God, I need you, you know, so. All right. How about you? I picked, well, my verse was Revelations 21:1-5, kind of a big chunk, but let me read this for us.</p><p>It says, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p><p>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold, a dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, and neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</p><p>And He who was seated on the throne said, Behold, I am making all things new." And I picked that verse because, yeah, it's just, it's easy to get caught up in what's going on in this world and in our lives and to feel like that is the end-all be-all, you know?</p><p>And I love this passage because it reminds me, no, there's a greater reality. And, you know, I mean, I think one of the toughest things in life is, uh, relationships, you know, and the people who, um, you know, frankly, that are for whatever reason, um, not on good terms with anymore, you know, whether that be, yeah, people who are not at our church anymore because they left on, you know, they left with hurt and anger, you know, or whether that be, you know, I think back to the old BBC days and my friends who were on the other side of that split.</p><p>And just to remember, like, I think it gives me perspective to remember, you know, one day we're all going to be in heaven, and we're all going to be friends, and we're all going to be around the throne of God, worshiping God together. And that gives me a lot of hope, and it helps keep things in perspective, right?</p><p>Let's, uh, let's love each other here. So it's not awkward later. Okay. That would be my word. Um, so, uh, my, the song I picked is what a day it'll be. Uh, it's a kind of a little known song. It's by a guy named Greg Ferguson. Uh, but it's a song about heaven.</p><p>And, um, yeah, so we're just gonna, we're gonna give this a shot. Um, yeah, we're just gonna sing. Just gonna sing. And, uh, join us if you would like. And, uh, yeah, let's do it. I'm calling on the God of Jacob God, whose love endures through generations. I know that you will keep your covenant.</p><p>I'm calling on the God of Moses, the one who opened up the ocean. I need you now to do the same thing for me. Oh God, oh God, I need you.
