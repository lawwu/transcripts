Like I get, I'm doubt people want to do monogamy. But it's always it's like 100% monogamy. And cheating is like always like the worst possible thing ever. And that bothers me. Yeah, I just wish there was a little bit of occasionally, once in a while, there's like, you know, we call it monoplot.</p><p>My friend who yelled like monoplot every time there's like a plot line in a story that is could be resolved by being just like slightly less monogamous. And like every pot's not monoplot, like you don't even have to be full poly, you just have to like have like a slight amount of flexibility, like, oh, well, then just bring over for a threesome.</p><p>Like, that's not even on the table. Not only is it not on the table, but like, it feels like it doesn't represent the general population either, like, around 5% of people are polyamorous, and probably like 15 to 30% are like, will be like open to some kind of exploration, like a little bit of looseness, which, where is that immediate nowhere drives me</p></div></div></body></html>
