Are they born? Are they trained, right? What would you need to do to get 10 more Elans? What would you need to do to get a hundred more Elans? What would you need to do to make a thousand more Elans? Are they already out there?</p><p>And we just haven't found them yet. Could we grow them some? Could we grow them in tanks? By the way, do we need a different kind of training program? Do we need, I don't know. Does there need to be a new kind of entrepreneurial university that trains entrepreneurs? It's just like a totally different thing.</p><p>Those are the underlying questions. I think if you show me 10 more Elans, I'll figure out how to fund their companies. I can tell you, like we work with a lot of great founders and we also work with Elan and he's still special, like he's still highly, he's still highly, he's still highly unusual, even, even relative to the other great entrepreneurs.</p><p>- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
