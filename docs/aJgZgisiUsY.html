My thoughts about the possible ways that Neuralink</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=131">00:02:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">might change the world and the human condition. I'll try to stick to some categories, some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=137">00:02:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">structure, and try to discuss off the top of my head my thoughts of the possibilities that fall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=143">00:02:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">within those categories. I should note here that a lot of the things I'll discuss are long-term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=150">00:02:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">visions of the future. To make all of these visions a reality is exceptionally difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=155">00:02:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a journey of many breakthroughs required, but I think we are now in the realm where a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=162">00:02:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of these things are scientific and engineering challenges that can be solved by great teams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=167">00:02:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">by bold innovation from many companies, not just Neuralink, hopefully many others,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=174">00:02:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully many competitors that push the boundaries of what is possible. But this video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=180">00:03:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is about the visions of the possible futures. And I think great efforts of humankind start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=189">00:03:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with a vision. Let me give you a quick outline of categories within which I see some exciting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=195">00:03:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">possibilities. So first is alleviation of human suffering. Second is understanding of consciousness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=202">00:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence.

Seventh is saving and replaying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=233">00:03:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of memories, but also saving and replaying of mental state or mind states, period. And finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=241">00:04:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">eighth is merging with artificial intelligence, all the exciting possibilities around that that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=246">00:04:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to discuss. So since I'm Russian, let's start by discussing human suffering. I think first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=253">00:04:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and foremost, as was mentioned by the team, is the possibility that Neuralink might help alleviate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=260">00:04:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">human suffering. The nervous system, the brain, at the very basic level, is the source of pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=265">00:04:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's both physical pain and psychological pain. So you can talk about anxiety, depression,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=271">00:04:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">trauma of all different kinds. The ability to measure signals from the brain, and perhaps more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=277">00:04:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">importantly, the ability to send signals and in a closed loop interact continuously with the brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=284">00:04:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sending signals in both directions. It seems like it provides a very rich toolkit with which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=290">00:04:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to start to deeply understand the human brain generally, but in the nearest term, to focus that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=297">00:04:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">exploration on the understanding of neurological diseases so that we may first, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=304">00:05:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">understand and second, to treat them. A huge number of mysteries yet to be uncovered at the very basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=311">00:05:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">level of how do we treat some of these diseases, and that falls into the category of human suffering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=317">00:05:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we often think about suffering as arising from the environment within which the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=322">00:05:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">individual lives. So by placing the focus on the environment, it allows us to kind of be hopeful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=329">00:05:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because we can make the environment better. The source of trauma, the source of anxiety,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=333">00:05:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the source of depression, all of the things that come up in political discourse, these are all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=338">00:05:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we can do something about. So that's what we focus on when we try to alleviate human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=343">00:05:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">suffering. But from another perspective, the real source of suffering and pain is the human mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=352">00:05:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which creates the experience, the lived experience from the perception of the external environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=361">00:06:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and the perception of the internal environment. Now there's a lot of discussion of meditation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=366">00:06:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">exercise, a lot of social programs and education, all kinds of things that aim to help the mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=376">00:06:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But in addition to that, the exciting possibility with a brain-computer interface is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=381">00:06:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we might be able to accelerate our understanding and treatment and control of the internal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=391">00:06:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">environment of the mind. Now of course, it's also important to say that there's injustice in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=395">00:06:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">world, there's evil in the world. Neither Neuralink or any other piece of technology will be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=400">00:06:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">get rid of hatred in the world. But the hope is that at the individual level, you'll be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=408">00:06:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">aid in the alleviation to some degree of all the sources of neurological suffering. So second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=417">00:06:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">category of future possibilities in Neuralink have to do around our understanding of how the brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=424">00:07:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and the mind works and all of the things that derive from that. So basically we'll supercharge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=430">00:07:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">research going on in neuroscience today. So first is understanding how the brain works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=435">00:07:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at the functional level. So all the different modules from memory to perception to cognition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=443">00:07:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and all the sub-modules of that. And as we untangle those pieces, it's possible that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=450">00:07:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">will inspire or instruct us on the engineering side of how to build smarter and smarter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=457">00:07:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">artificial intelligence systems. So inspire totally new algorithms for learning systems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=463">00:07:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for reasoning systems, for knowledge base, knowledge acquisition, and so on. And as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=470">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">push that further, of course to me as an artificial intelligence researcher, the exciting possibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=476">00:07:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is that we may be able to understand human intelligence where not location-wise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=483">00:08:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but functionally where intelligence arises in the brain or good answers to the question of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=490">00:08:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what is intelligence.

Now the next level of understanding the human brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=533">00:08:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as was mentioned by the team, as I bring up often, the fascinating, hardest, most interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=539">00:08:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">problem I would say of the mind is the hard problem of consciousness.

As a quick side note,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1464">00:24:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there's interesting echoes of the memory replay that you've seen our reinforcement learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1470">00:24:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">systems. So it's kind of interesting to think that instead of just us being able to replay our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1476">00:24:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">memories, it could be our own little machine learning systems that can learn something from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1482">00:24:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">our previous memories by replaying them over and over to try to give us maybe a strategy of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1487">00:24:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to avoid those memories in the past. So it's basically converting our prior experiences into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1493">00:24:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">data, and once it's converted into data, that could be used for all kinds of applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1500">00:25:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can think of like a personal machine learning system that can replay your memories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1504">00:25:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and try to figure out, try to be a personal executive assistant to you to advise you what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1511">00:25:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to learn from those experiences.

I think in the early days of our development with social networks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1544">00:25:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on, you could get away easier by being careless with people's data. I think my long-term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1552">00:25:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps optimistic, but I think it's a realistic view of the future that people will demand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1557">00:25:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">much more control over their data, demand much more transparency around privacy and security,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgZgisiUsY&t=1564">00:26:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">transparency and clarity.
