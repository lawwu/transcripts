I'm leaving with a sense of urgency. It was really a trip I'll never forget. My name is Michael Porter, Jr., and I play professional basketball. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) I heard about iJM through really a conference.</p><p>It was a bunch of professional athletes. It was a great experience, and I heard about them and what they do and the work they do. - Yeah, Michael, MPJ, I've known him for about a year. I met him actually at a conference where I presented the work of iJM.</p><p>He immediately came up to me and said, "Hey, I love the work you're doing. "How can I be involved?" And getting to spend time with him here, he's such a curious person. He has such a big heart. - Thank you for your glory. Thank you for bringing each of us on Team Freedom from around the world to be here today.</p><p>- The work that I think that iJM does is very important and it's something that's close to my heart. It's something that I've always saw as a global issue and wanted to play my part in doing what I could just to help out in any way I could. It means a lot to share with my family.</p><p>I brought my sister down here with me. You know, that's kind of my traveling buddy. I brought her husband. Nicodemus Christopher, he's kind of like my right-hand man. You know, they're looking forward to being here as well. - Yeah, I heard out here in the Philippines they love basketball, and I think, you know, being an athlete, it should mean so much more than just putting a ball in a hoop or, you know, throwing a ball across a field or whatever sports you play.</p><p>I think really using the platform God gave you for impact to, you know, inspire other people to make other people happy is really the bigger purpose. To be out here in a country that they love basketball is a blessing, and, you know, I've already had a lot of people come up to me and want pictures and things like that, so to get to put a smile on people's face is amazing.</p><p>(gentle music) - I was 16 years old when I was tricked into this computer job. I became orphaned. My mother and father died when I was 13. I was experiencing physical and verbal abuse from my siblings, so I had this desire to move out and be independent. So I stumbled this friend request in Facebook from a stranger.</p><p>The girl who recruited me was in Pampanga. She told me that I could take classes at night after my work, that she will give me free food, that she will give me free lodging. When I got there to the house, I saw that instead of a computer shop that I was expecting, we arrived in a house with a red gate.</p><p>When I entered the house, I saw girls came out from one of the rooms inside that house. They were naked, and I was like so shocked. I didn't even know how to react on that, and that's when she explained to me what the real job was. Realizing what the real situation is, I told her that I don't wanna do this anymore.</p><p>I wanna go back home, but she told me that I had to pay for the 150 USD that she sent me before I could go back home. I didn't have any money with me back then, so I literally fell into her trap, and that's how I got exploited there every day, sometimes at eight hours a day, sometimes at 12 hours.</p><p>So when I refused to do what they order me to do, they would punish me, they will starve me, they would let me sleep on the floor without anything. I would describe it as a very long tunnel that I cannot see the end, you know, where there would be sunlight or anything.</p><p>And I was just desperate the whole time, desperate, hopeless. - You know, those stories are always so heartbreaking and touching just 'cause they're so personal, and you get to see the person that went through it, but I think it's also so encouraging, and to see them use their story to inspire, but also to open up and just use their voice, I think is encouraging.</p><p>- No one is safe nowadays, no one is safe. Your daughter could be next, your sister could be next, your niece or nephews could be next. - Your visit to the Philippines matters greatly, as it brings to light the enormity of the online threats against our children, but it also possibly could highlight the efforts of the Philippine government in prioritizing the fight against OSIAC and CSAM.</p><p>- It was awesome to be able to get so many different government agencies in a room with us at IJM. It just, it goes to show the power of what these athletes can do, right? You travel all the way across the world, and people know who you are. - Athletes in America sometimes are so involved in their sport that they don't realize the platform and the impact they could have.</p><p>- It seemed like they understand that this is a priority, and it seemed like they were willing to play their part as well. (upbeat music) - Right now we're at a park in Papanga, playing with the kids from a shelter. - It's gonna be, I think, a life-changing experience.</p><p>It's gonna put things in perspective for me, but more importantly, I think getting to spend time with some of those kids, I think will be amazing. - Just imagine the kind of exploitation that they have experienced in the past, and now they can be children again, and they can just walk, and run, and just do something else that they could not, they're unable to do in their previous life.</p><p>- It's just good to see, you know, all the hard things they've been through. Still here being kids, still here, just wanting to enjoy life, and smile, and have fun. It's really good to see. - Walking into that shelter, I kinda immediately saw the little girl. She was so helpless.</p><p>Everyone else in the shelter was a little bit older, kinda knew what was going on a little bit. You know, she was a little bit, I think, just frightened about the whole situation at first, all of us being there, but later on in the day, she kinda opened up, and we got to roll the ball back and forth, and that was a touching moment for me.</p><p>- Yeah, this has been, this I can pretty confidently say, this has been the best trip of my life. I am so grateful for the opportunity to be here, and see the work that IJM is doing. It's really tugged at my soul, so I'm grateful, yeah. - Watching him with the kids, you know, like, they could barely reach up and give him a high five 'cause he's so much taller than them, but he has this heart for children, and it's very apparent by the way he was with the kids.</p><p>So, it's been awesome. - There was moments throughout the whole week, things that I won't forget, and things that I'll be able to take going forward, and hopefully help this issue moving forward. - Just by listening, you provide value. We need you. You encourage us and give us hope.</p><p>- A large part of my life has been trying to make it myself, and get to the place where I'm at today, but I think being out here, for me, is all about how I can serve others, and see how God can impact my heart through serving others.
