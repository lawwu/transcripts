I just think like overall for me social media and like the day and age that we live in like the cons Outweigh the pros for me personally and probably a lot of dudes in general like it depends like what you want out of life And what you're trying to reach for me I'm trying to you know Walk in my faith and I'm trying to be a man of integrity and and like grow And I just feel like social media is a hindrance to that first of all you see all this dope stuff going on you can Get into like the comparison game or whatever, but then it's also like as a dude one of our struggles is females And there's unlimited baddies on Instagram so like If I'm being a hundred percent like if you were trying to focus and stay away from like it could be a trap if that's your Thing so I just you got to be self-aware if that's your thing that you could fall into You can remove it for a while and for me it helped me focus</p></div></div></body></html>
