Yeah, that's a good point. It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">quite know what it wants to be.

I mean, I heard you say this is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">people who want to break out.

So let's just jump in. What do you think some of those common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">obstacles are that kind of hold people back from pushing forward?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">What I try to do with this book and had in my head the entire time is show, don't tell. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">when I use that third person voice, Matthew, like you're at the center of the journey too much here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to show and illustrate rather than tell.

For example, in this exercise, it's in the book, I was talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to a student trying to figure out what they want to be.

Bobby Brown,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">admittedly hates math.

And she needs somebody, a quant, to help her with that. And I picked up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the phone, put it on the table. And I said, "If Bobby Brown answers right now, this is what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">meant to be." She did.

So I just say that as an illustration about what happens when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">shift the questions to where do you want to work?

I mentioned that some people might not know where they want to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And you mentioned a couple things I could talk about. You have an exercise in the book that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">think people should buy and take no matter where you are in your career. What about when someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">has an idea of what they should do? And this is going to bring it back to the title of the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're wavering. For me, I started this podcast. And when I did, I put one toe in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">water and said, "Let's see if there's eight episodes.

I think this is one of the biggest themes. You titled the book so obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's one of the biggest things. But how do people really get the buy-in and commitment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in themselves? And what's the research say about the way you plan and the impact it can have on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the outcome? Yeah. I think when I meet someone or a business owner or founder who the business is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">either failing or in some respects, it's failing them emotionally because it no longer satisfies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">their soul. A few years in, when I do the postmortem about how did we get here? What I often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">find, it's because they refuse to ask the right questions at the beginning of the journey. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a few reasons why. When we have a great idea at three o'clock in the morning, most people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are so excited that they've had something that stirred them, especially if they're in a bad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">situation, that they are then afraid to subject that idea to scrutiny. Because we also aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">taught to focus on opportunity costs, especially if we don't value ourselves enough. We don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about opportunity costs. We instead focus on how do I implement this idea? And I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">how most people find themselves in a bad position. So I do the opposite. I totally focus when I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a big idea on opportunity cost. I try to project Matt Higgins three years from now and ask whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this idea is big enough, interesting enough, valuable enough to sustain me three years from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">now. That requires you to believe two fundamental things. One, if you're somebody who came up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a good idea, you can come up with an even better idea a week from now. It's a little bit like real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">estate. Brokers will always tell you there's always a better house coming on the market next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">week. The same is true with somebody who's an idea factory. So don't be afraid to rule out your own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">idea. And then two, I go through the exercise of opportunity cost. I try to imagine what could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">better than this? What could be in three years from now and I'm out of this situation? And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">reason why that's so important is most people make relative decisions to the situation they're in to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">escape it. Most big decisions we make, and you see this in personal relationships when somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">leaves somebody for another person, that rarely works out. And same thing with a job.

So what's the point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of saying that? It's very important how we process failure. One, accept the fact that the goal is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">continue, is to survive. So how do I survive? How do I keep going? And the number one thing you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to do to survive is to preserve your sense of self-worth.

So number one, my process is, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">acknowledge that I failed. So I remain intellectually honest. Also by acknowledging it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">verbally and otherwise, it loses its power over you. The fear of even acknowledging it is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that kind of is half the battle and being able to be like, yeah, I failed, whatever. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">then number two, I am not a failure. I just refuse to be identified. And that's the point I made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about these outrageously successful people.

So while I struggle with it, I remind myself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that is the way to do, but those four simple, easy steps and then go forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Back to our point about the musician, like, when should he give up?

So it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to be in the top 5% of all podcasts that have been created, not the top 5% that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2706" target="_blank">00:45:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">active, but of all, you literally just have to produce 10 episodes and keep going.

And I would learn public markets and, you know, maybe I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">outrun the timing and I could just show how it could be done better.

Long story short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3oU_6V1bI&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the opening of my book.
