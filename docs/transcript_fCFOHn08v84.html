I think it's easy to use. I think it does a lot more than what you need it to do when you think, how do I manage this? And I'm not saying you can't use the other ones, but I'll tell you why I like the app and why I decided to partner with Card Pointers to get a discount for all of you because I think it has a ton of value.</p><p>So first, you could just put all your cards in and you could do it without having to link your bank. So you could just say, I have an Amex Platinum and then it's added to your app and they keep track of all the perks and the benefits of that card because the app knows what the perks and benefits are of an Amex Platinum.</p><p>Now, if you go in and tell it, here's the date I signed up for that card and then they'll know, here's when your annual fees due and all that kind of stuff. So there's a view in the app where I could say, show me the calendar of all my upcoming annual fees so I can keep track on maybe I want to cancel a card before that happens.</p><p>Maybe I want to call up and see if there's a retention offer, anything like that.</p></div></div></body></html>
