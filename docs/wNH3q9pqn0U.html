is about real-time co-scientists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So think about pair programmers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">How many

but for doing things in the real world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.600</a></span> | <span

you can see here, now I have this board, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.080</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">And it's measuring the temperature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually have a heat pad, so I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">can increase the temperature and make it very, very hot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully, it's not going to melt the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I can send that to my science assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to analyze the data and kind of give me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">an answer in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's telling me, like, OK, the ambient conditions indicate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">like, stable, dark, quiet environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it has, like-- it knows it can measure all these different sensors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">No buttons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But it sees that the temperature is 26 degrees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I can actually give it more context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I can go and create a protocol and say, like, this is the type of experiment that I want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever you give me feedback about the data or the images that I'm sending from the microscope,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">which I can also do, it's going to be in the context of that experiment with those conditions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and those constraints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, like, if you are actually doing that experiment several times, you can go ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and create a custom page for your experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will monitor the data from the-- we're going to connect, again, the JackDack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to monitor and plot the data in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And the cool thing is also that if you want to leave your experiment running and go away, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you could actually have cameras that are autonomous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">To go back to the previous talk, they're not fully autonomous, but they can track objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So this camera is called re-camera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, by the way, all the hardware I'm showing you and all the components are open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So right now, I'm going to set it to track me as a person and start the tracking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's running a model on the camera itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to start, like, moving around to see me and see where I'm going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could train a custom model, like, to track, like, crystal growth or specific objects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that you want to monitor and in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And this runs on Wi-Fi, so you can place it anywhere and then control, like, the conditions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in the experiments, like increase the temperature or decrease the temperature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, oh, it sees all of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to stop this for now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's like a short-- and here we're seeing, like, our temperature kind of increasing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my heat pad stopped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's just like a simple, like, demo of, like, without having a specific experiment in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I'm going to switch to my slides and actually show you what happens when you record</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">much longer experiments and what it can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do we care about co-scientists?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not talking about real-time co-scientists, just co-scientists in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why should you care about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that there is a data overload in science, and there's a lot of complexity, a lot of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to parse through and analyze, and AI can really help with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We also know that beyond the analysis of data, fast, at scale, they can help with generating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">new hypotheses and maybe identifying blind spots in prior work and in your own thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also know that they can speed things up, right?</span></div><div

could test 100 hypotheses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I got inspired to build this demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, the cost of all the parts is under $300, and it took me two weeks to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's open source, so you can play with it and hack it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I got inspired to do this because of this demo from DeepMind.</span></div><div

co-scientists, and it was actually showing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.440</a></span> | <span

scientists,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the

summarize them, we look at data, we rank the options, we rank the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hypothesis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So they actually created an orchestration of different agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Each of them was actually working on Gemini 2.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then with this orchestration of ranking the different results, the different hypothesis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">doing search online, doing search on papers, come up with a plan for the researcher to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only that they did that, but they actually tested it against prior discoveries, and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">was super interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So they tested it against prior discoveries on gene transfer mechanisms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So a discovery that took scientists 12 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It took the AI scientist two days to come up with, without having seen the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was not aware of how the gene transfer works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">This was not part of the training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was one verification by trying to replicate past results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But another one was to come up with a completely new hypothesis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So they used it for liver fibrosis target treatment discovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the AI co-scientists came up with target drugs that were actually efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in the lab, in wet lab, they were tested by experts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not a science fiction, it's not like something in the future, it's actually happening now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And for me, what was inspiring about this is like, when we can make real discoveries in drug, drug discovery,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">like healthcare treatment, bacterial resistance, new type of materials, I think that can be accelerated doing it in real time with a scientist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This clicker doesn't work very well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the vision was, instead of just doing it like on the data, like not sync, like async, and giving the researchers a plan based on the data that exists,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">what if we do it in real time, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And we formulate this hypothesis based on the empirical data we're observing in the lab in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Or it could be like, when you're observing the robot, like breaking down in real time, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So what motivated me was the results from the AI co-scientists, but also this vision from Silver and Sutton,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">which is, they just published this paper, Welcome to the Era of Experience, which is fantastic, it's very short, if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And they really talk about how we're going past the era of human data, where we're only indexing and making predictions based on the data sets that we created,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and going to an era where the AI learns from the continuous environment in which we operate, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially with multimodal, when we have real time data from images, from sensors, from audio streams, like that is possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I hope I convinced you by now that real time matters, and I wanted to show you like how I use my system with longer experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you already saw like the chat image, and I had to find experiments that I could actually do at home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is the overview of the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's a very simple React app, and it has like all the input sources that you've seen live in action, like the JackTag sensors via USB, different webcams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you can add as many webcams as you want, text input, it actually works with voice, I forgot to show that, you can talk to it and it talks back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, all of these like inputs become web hooks, and I can, I'm going to go into more detail how I optimize each and one of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that gets sent to a backend which communicates with the real-time API, I use the Gemini in this case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I had to, this is the information flow, so, you have the physical sensors, and for the JackTag, I'm actually using the web USB API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that goes to the frontend hooks, which gets pulled by the context assembly, and the context assembly actually is always checking what sort of modalities are present.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we have text? Do we have voice? Do we have image? Do we have a chat history?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And depending on what modalities are present, every single time I'm sending a message, it builds this context that gets sent to the API that gives me back a response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And, this is how the unified context assembly works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I guess like the very important piece here is how you're doing this context injection, depending on what sensors you have connected, and the type of experiment you're defining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And making this dynamic on the fly, like when you create the protocols.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And, that was the, those were the ingredients for the code, now let's talk about the ingredients for the hardware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when I start doing the experiments, I had to list and put out all the parts that I had at my disposal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of like cooking, right? So, it's like what can I make with all these sensors, like these are my inputs, these are my outputs, these are all my cameras, and all my cables, and how many boards I have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">What sort of experiments could I create with that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I also had the constraint of doing experiments that I can measure in real time for this talk, and also that are safe for me to do at home, and I can travel with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So, that really narrowed down the list of things that I could play with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one thing that I did was exploring crystallization, so you can see there like the crystals that I was growing, and that took longer, and I recorded the whole thing, and fermentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And, let's dive into each and one of those. So, this was my lab in a box in our apartment in Tokyo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The people coming to the house were very confused every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There was something, no explosions though, so that was good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for crystal growth, how many of you remember this from chemistry?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, okay, that's awesome. So, I don't need to go into great detail, but basically the principle is quite simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you oversaturate the solution by adding salt in hot water, and then you're like slowly cooling it off, and that creates this process, this nucleation, and the growth of crystals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the trick in having beautiful crystals is how you do the cooling off, right? It needs to be gradual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to not move like the liquid or the object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the gradual cooling and the level of humidity is what gives you beautiful crystal formation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the main things we want to measure in this example is what are our curves for how fast the salt dissolves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, where are the places where the crystals are being formed? Those are called nucleation sites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the growth rate of the crystals? And that is affected by temperature concentration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah, I forgot to play this. This was like a sped up. So, this was a recording from the microscope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's moving because it actually has a fan blowing cool air from ice, so that's why the camera is moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That was how I was like cooling it off. But you can see the data in the sensors changing on the side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like being recorded for an extended period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I get a CSV from the sensor values, and I can go and analyze that and kind of get a sense for like what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Was I cooling it off too fast or too slow? Were my crystal like growing or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I also play with different samples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I had samples that I would put in the fridge and in the room and like a different temperature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I could also measure and have like control groups for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once I have that CSV data, I can plot it, right? So, I can actually see what was my crystal growth rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And if my temperature was like the best. And I can plot that for the different samples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And right now, I don't have that integrated live on the platform, but that's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I had to write a separate script to get the CSV data and create this visualizations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the insight I got from this is that the crystal formation is actually not gradual, that it happens in bursts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that was something that surprised me when I looked at the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, once the critical saturation is reached, there's like sudden crystal growth formation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's not like something that is kind of like slowly growing, but it grows in bursts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And here is like 40 minutes recording of the crystal growth, like super sped up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can kind of see how the humidity and the temperature was changing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the next one was, how am I doing on time? Because I have a lot of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I might skip over fermentation, just in interest of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm sure all of you have dealt with fermentation in some shape or form, even if it was liquid, having to benefit the end result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But the insight here is to actually control how much salt and sugar we put into the different dough and then measure, and then also change the temperature and measure the growth rate and the CO2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the fermentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also have like a sped up recording of the data collection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I already showed you the recamera and the fact that it's mobile and it can track objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the education version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to play with some of these things and just kind of do your own experiments, please like the lab mine that I showed you is not deployed yet, but it will be and the code will be open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But this you can play with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to put your own API, but it runs on the phone and you can test the camera for now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you have a micro bit or you want to connect mine, you're welcome to try it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me know if the QR doesn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, this this is a version kind of like for to teach it to kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wanted to end by talking a little bit about the open source ecosystem that can support this type of initiative to go beyond the demo and kind of like a cool experimentation to a real real solution for scientists and builders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's an entire open source ecosystem for recreating all the lab equipment, but then also for creating machines that can support the automation of pipetting and like doing all the analysis that you need to do in a lab and all the manipulation that you need to do in a lab.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The Jubilee motion platform, it's actually coming from University of Washington where I did my PhD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's open source and there is an open bio reactor and there's actually a workshop that just took place in April at UW where they had people for a week hacking on creating different solutions for automating scientific experiments in the lab.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So anything from like droplet manipulation to robot handling liquids and mixing like vials and things like that and other application with Jubilee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So definitely check them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And for the future, and this is my last slide, you can imagine that based on the samples that we're collecting from this cameras and sensors and voice, it's much easier to create simulations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't need to be limited by the experiments we're doing in real life, but those experiments that we're doing in real life are going to inform realistic simulations, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could actually create a simulation of my crystal growth, but more useful stuff right like bacteria colony growth and run those simulations with the lab conditions and then identify what are the best conditions for the experiment and create those conditions in the real life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So very excited about integrating simulation and I think that's where the this is going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was me if you want to read more about my projects and paper and all the open source projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I do a lot of work in education as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all on my website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And as Ben mentioned this morning, we are going to do an AI education summit and very excited about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of you who saw my talk like in New York or last year know how much how passionate I am about about education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So I hope you can join us for the summit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I really appreciate you coming to the talk today and I'll be around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH3q9pqn0U&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div
