Oh, it was fun. I don't know. Yeah. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=43">00:00:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">well, look, I'm a pretty competitive person.

We all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=62">00:01:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">trained together.

So yeah, but it was awesome. It was just a lot of fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=79">00:01:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You weren't scared?

It's a kind of art form, I think, that you can do for your whole life. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=106">00:01:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it's basically a game, a sport of human chess you can think of. There's a lot of strategy. There's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=111">00:01:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of sort of interesting human dynamics of using leverage and all that kind of stuff. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=116">00:01:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of incredible what you could do. You could do things like a small opponent could defeat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=121">00:02:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a much larger opponent. And you get to understand the way the mechanics of the human body works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=126">00:02:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">because of that. But you certainly can't be distracted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=129">00:02:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">No. It's 100% focused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=132">00:02:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=132">00:02:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But to compete, I needed to get around the fact that I didn't want it to be like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=137">00:02:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">big thing. So I basically just rolled up with a hat and sunglasses, and I was wearing a COVID mask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=144">00:02:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=144">00:02:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I registered under my first and middle name, so Mark Elliott.

So it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=154">00:02:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty low key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=155">00:02:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're still a public figure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=157">00:02:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

So, I mean, the main thing, like people who train jujitsu, it's like you need to not have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=187">00:03:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">pride because, I mean, all the stuff that you were talking about before about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=190">00:03:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, getting choked or getting, you know, a joint lock, you only get into a bad situation if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=198">00:03:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not willing to tap once you've already lost. But obviously, when you're getting started with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=204">00:03:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">something, you're not going to be able to do it.

So like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=632">00:10:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of jujitsu players are fine being on their back.

Right. Cause even if you have control, you're just, you're not going to be on your back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=643">00:10:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not going to be taking punches while you're on your back.

And, and I'd, I'd probably rather be the top player, but, um, but I'm also smaller. Right. I'm not, I'm not like a heavyweight guy. Right. So from that perspective, I think like, you know, it's especially because, you know, if I'm doing a competition, I'll compete with people who are my size, but a lot of my friends are bigger than me. So, um, so back to the point. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=672">00:11:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=673">00:11:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=673">00:11:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Back takes probably pretty important, right? Because that's where you have the most leverage advantage, right? Where, where, um, you know, people, you know, their arms, your arms are very weak behind you. Right. So, um, so being able to get to the back and, and, and take that pretty, pretty important, but I don't know. I feel like the right strategy is to not be too committed to any single submission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=690">00:11:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But that said, I don't like hurting people. So, um, so I always think that chokes are, are a somewhat more humane way to go than, than joint locks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=700">00:11:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And it's more about control. It's less dynamic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=703">00:11:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=703">00:11:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're basically like a Habib Nurmagomedov type of fighter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=707">00:11:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so let's go.

I think it's like the clean, the clean way to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=712">00:11:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Straightforward answer right there. What advice would you give to, um, to people looking to start learning jujitsu? Given how busy you are, given where you are in life, that you're able to do this, you're able to train, you're able to compete and get, uh, uh, to learn something from this interesting art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=729">00:12:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I just think you have to be willing to, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=732">00:12:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to just get beaten up a lot.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=736">00:12:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's, but, but I mean, over time, I think that there's, there's a flow to all these things and there's, um, you know, one of the, one of, I don't know, my, my experiences that I think kind of transcends, you know, running a company and the different, different activities that I like doing are, I, I really believe that like, if you're going to accomplish whatever, anything, a lot of it is just being willing to push through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=762">00:12:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=763">00:12:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and having the grit and determination to, to, to push through difficult situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=768">00:12:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I think that for a lot of people that, um, that ends up being sort of a, a difference maker between the people who, who, who kind of get the most done and not, I mean, there's all these questions about like, um, you know, how, how many days people want to work and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=783">00:13:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think almost all the people who like start successful companies or things like that are just, are working extremely hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=788">00:13:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think one of the things that you learn both by doing this over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=792">00:13:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, you know, very acutely with things like jujitsu or surfing is, um, you can't push through everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=799">00:13:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that that's, you, you learn this stuff very acutely, you run, uh, doing sports compared to running a company because running a company, the cycle times are so long, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=812">00:13:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like you start a project and then, you know, it's like months later, or, you know, if you're, you're building hardware, it could be years later before you're actually getting feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=822">00:13:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=822">00:13:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And able to, you know, make the next set of decisions for the next version of the thing that you're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=826">00:13:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas you, one of the things that I just think is mentally so nice about these very high turnaround conditioning sports, things like that is you, you get feedback very quickly, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=837">00:13:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, okay, like I, I don't counter something correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=839">00:13:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You get punched in the face, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=840">00:14:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So not in jujitsu, you don't, you don't get punched in jujitsu, but in MMA, um, there are all these analogies between all these things that I think actually hold that are, that are like important life lessons, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=852">00:14:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, okay, you're surfing a wave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=854">00:14:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, you know, sometimes you're like, you can't go in the other direction on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=860">00:14:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=860">00:14:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, there are limits to kind of what, you know, it's like foil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=864">00:14:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You can, you can pump the foil and push pretty hard in a bunch of directions, but like, yeah, you, you know, it's, it's some level, like the momentum against you is strong enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=873">00:14:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You're that's not going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=875">00:14:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and I do think that, um, that's sort of a, a humbling, but also an important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=882">00:14:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Lesson for, and I think people who are running things or building things, it's like, yeah, you, you, um, you know, a lot of the game is just being able to kind of push and, and, and, and work through complicated things, but you also need to kind of have enough of an understanding of like which things you're, you just can't push through and where, where, um, um, the finesse is more important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=901">00:15:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=902">00:15:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What are your jujitsu life lessons?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=904">00:15:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think you did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=907">00:15:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You made it sound so simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=911">00:15:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You were so eloquent that it's easy to miss, but basically being okay and accepting the wisdom and the joy in the, uh, getting your ass kicked in the full range of what that means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=926">00:15:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's a big gift of the being humbled, somehow being humbled, especially physically opens your mind to the full process of learning what it means to learn, which is being willing to suck at something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=941">00:15:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think jujitsu is just very repetitively efficiently humbles you over and over and over and over to where you can carry that lessons to places where you, you don't get humbled as much, whether it's research or running a company or building stuff, the, the cycle is longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=959">00:15:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And jujitsu, you can just get humbled in this period of an hour over and over and over and over, especially when you're a beginner, you'll have a little person, just, you know, somebody much smarter than you just kick your ass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=971">00:16:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, repeatedly, uh, definitively where there's no argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=977">00:16:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=977">00:16:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you literally tap because if you don't tap, you're going to die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=981">00:16:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an agreement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=983">00:16:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You could have killed me just now, but we're friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=986">00:16:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to agree that you're not going to, and that kind of humbling process, it just does something to your psyche, to your ego that puts it in its proper context to realize that, you know, everything in this life is like a journey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1000">00:16:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">me from sucking through a hard process of improving rigorously, day after day after</span></div><div

Well, speaking of which, let me ask you about AI. It seems like this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1075">00:17:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">for the entirety of the human civilization, is an interesting year for the development</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1080">00:18:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of artificial intelligence. A lot of interesting stuff is happening. So meta is a big part of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1090">00:18:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the idea of the 65 billion parameter model, there's a lot of interesting questions I can ask here, one of which has to do with open source. But first, can you tell the story of developing of this model and making the complicated decision of how to release it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1108">00:18:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, sure. I think you're right, first of all, that in the last year, there have been a bunch of advances on scaling up these large transformer models. So there's the language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1120">00:18:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">equivalent of it with large language models. There's sort of the image generation equivalent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1125">00:18:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">with these large diffusion models. There's a lot of fundamental research that's gone into this. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1131">00:18:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">meta has taken the approach of being quite open and academic in our development of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1143">00:19:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of this is we want to have the best people in the world researching this. And a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1150">00:19:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the best people want to know that they're going to be able to share their work. So that's part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1154">00:19:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">deal that we have is that we can get, if you're one of the top AI researchers in the world and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1160">00:19:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">come here, you can get access to kind of industry scale infrastructure. And part of our ethos is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1167">00:19:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to share what's invented broadly. We do that with a lot of the different AI tools that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1174">00:19:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">create. And LLAMA is the language model that our research team made. And LLAMA is the language model that our research team made. And LLAMA is the language model that our research team made. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1180">00:19:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we did a limited open source release for it, which was intended for researchers to be able to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1189">00:19:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But responsibility and getting safety right on these is very important. So we didn't think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1198">00:19:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for the first one, there were a bunch of questions around whether we should be releasing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1203">00:20:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">commercially. So we kind of punted on that for V1 of LLAMA and just released it from research. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1209">00:20:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously by releasing it for research, it's out there, but companies know that they're not supposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1216">00:20:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of put it into commercial releases. And we're working on the follow-up models for this and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1222">00:20:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking through how exactly this should work for follow-on now that we've had time to work on a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1230">00:20:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">more of the safety and the pieces around that. But overall, I mean, this is... I just kind of think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1240">00:20:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it would be good if there were a lot of different folks who had the ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1247">00:20:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to build state-of-the-art technology here. And not just a small number of big companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1255">00:20:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But to train one of these AI models, the state-of-the-art models, just takes hundreds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1263">00:21:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of millions of dollars of infrastructure, right? So there are not that many organizations in the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1269">00:21:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that can do that at the biggest scale today. And now it gets more efficient every day. So I do think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1278">00:21:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that that will be available to more folks over time. But I just think there's all this innovation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1283">00:21:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">out there that people can create. And I just think that we'll also learn a lot by seeing what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1291">00:21:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">whole community of students and hackers and startups and different folks build with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1298">00:21:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's kind of been the goal. And I think that's kind of what we're trying to do. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1299">00:21:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">been how we've approached this. And it's also how we've done a lot of our infrastructure. And we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1303">00:21:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">took our whole data center design and our server design, and we built this open compute project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1307">00:21:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">where we just made that public. And part of the theory was like, "All right, if we make it so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1312">00:21:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">more people can use this server design, then that'll enable more innovation. It'll also make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1318">00:21:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the server design more efficient. And that'll make our business more efficient too." So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1322">00:22:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">worked. And we've just done this with a lot of our infrastructure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1325">00:22:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for people who don't know, you did the limited release, I think, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1329">00:22:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">February of this year of LAMA. And it got "leaked," meaning it escaped the limited release</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1343">00:22:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect. But it was something you probably anticipated, given that it's just released</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1349">00:22:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">through researchers. We shared it with researchers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1350">00:22:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're right. So it's just trying to make sure that there's a slow release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1355">00:22:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. But from there, I just would love to get your comment on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1359">00:22:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">what happened next, which is like, there's a very vibrant open source community that just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1362">00:22:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">builds stuff on top of it. There's LAMA CPP, basically stuff that makes it more efficient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1369">00:22:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to run on smaller computers. There's combining with reinforcement learning with human feedback,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1375">00:22:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">so some of the different interesting fine-tuning mechanisms. There's then also fine-tuning in GPT-3</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1381">00:23:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">generations. There's a lot of GPT-4-all, Alpaca, Colossal AI, all these kinds of models just spring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1388">00:23:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">up, run on top of it. What do you think about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1392">00:23:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I think it's been really neat to see. I mean, there's been folks who are getting it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1397">00:23:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">run on local devices. So if you're an individual who just wants to experiment with this at home,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1404">00:23:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably don't have a large budget to get access to a large amount of cloud compute,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1409">00:23:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">so getting it to run on your local laptop is pretty good and pretty relevant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1415">00:23:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there are things like LAMA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1418">00:23:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">CPP, re-implemented it more efficiently. So now even when we run our own versions of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1425">00:23:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">we can do it on way less compute and it's just way more efficient, save a lot of money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1429">00:23:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">for everyone who uses this. So that is good. I do think it's worth calling out that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1438">00:23:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">because this was a relatively early release, LAMA isn't quite as on the frontier as, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1448">00:24:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the biggest OpenAI models or the biggest Google models. You mentioned that the largest LAMA model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1456">00:24:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that we released had 65 billion parameters. And no one knows, I guess outside of OpenAI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1463">00:24:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what the specs are for GPT-4, but I think my understanding is it's like 10 times bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1471">00:24:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think Google's Palm model is also, I think, has about 10 times as many parameters. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1477">00:24:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the LAMA models are very efficient. They're not as efficient as the Google Palm model, but they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1478">00:24:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">very efficient. So they perform well for something that's around 65 billion parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1482">00:24:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, that was also part of this because there was this whole debate around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1486">00:24:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is it good for everyone in the world to have access to the most frontier AI models? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1495">00:24:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think as the AI models start approaching something that's like a super human intelligence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1503">00:25:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a bigger question that we'll have to grapple with. But right now, I mean, these are still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1508">00:25:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">very basic tools. They're powerful in the sense that a lot of open source software like databases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1516">00:25:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">or web servers can enable a lot of pretty important things. But I don't think anyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1524">00:25:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">looks at the current generation of LAMA and thinks it's anywhere near a super intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1530">00:25:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that a bunch of those questions around like, is it good to kind of get out there? I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1536">00:25:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">at this stage, surely. You want to be able to get out there and do a lot of things. But I think at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1538">00:25:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">this stage, surely. You want more researchers working on it for all the reasons that open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1542">00:25:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">source software has a lot of advantages. And we talked about efficiency before, but another one is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1546">00:25:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just open source software tends to be more secure because you have more people looking at it openly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1551">00:25:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and scrutinizing it and finding holes in it. And that makes it more safe. So I think at this point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1557">00:25:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it's more, I think it's generally agreed upon that open source software is generally more secure and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1565">00:26:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">safer than things that are kind of developed and developed by people who are more skilled at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1567">00:26:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And I think that's something that's more likely to get developed in a silo where people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1572">00:26:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">try to get through security through obscurity. So I think that for the scale of what we're seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1577">00:26:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">now with AI, I think we're more likely to get to good alignment and good understanding of kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1585">00:26:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">what needs to do to make this work well by having it be open source. And that's something that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1589">00:26:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">think is quite good to have out there and happening publicly at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1592">00:26:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Matt have released a lot of models as open source. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1597">00:26:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">image buying model. I mean, I'll ask you questions about those, but the point is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1602">00:26:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you've open sourced quite a lot. You've been spearheading the open source movement. Where's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1607">00:26:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that's really positive, inspiring to see from one angle, from the research angle, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1613">00:26:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">there's folks who are really terrified about the existential threat of artificial intelligence.

But where do you see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1627">00:27:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the future?

That's one tension. And the other one is, do you want to put a powerful tool in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1641">00:27:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">hands of bad actors, even though it probably has a huge amount of positive impact also?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1647">00:27:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, again, I think for the stage that we're at in the development of AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1652">00:27:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think anyone looks at the current state of things and thinks that this is super intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1657">00:27:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And the models that we're talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1660">00:27:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the llama models here are generally an order of magnitude smaller than what open AI or Google are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1667">00:27:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">doing. So I think that at least for the stage that we're at now, the equity is balanced strongly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1674">00:27:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in my view, towards doing this more openly. I think if you got something that was closer to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1680">00:28:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">super intelligence, then I think you'd have to discuss that more and think through that a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1687">00:28:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">more. And we haven't made a decision yet as to what we would do if we were in that position,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1691">00:28:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think there's a good chance that we're pretty far off from that position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1694">00:28:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm certainly not saying that the position that we're taking on this now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1703">00:28:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">applies to every single thing that we would ever do. And certainly inside the company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1709">00:28:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we probably do more open source work than most of the other big tech companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1714">00:28:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but we also don't open source everything. I know a lot of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1717">00:28:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">companies are open source, but we're not open sourcing the core app code for WhatsApp or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1720">00:28:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Instagram or something.

Whereas the software that we do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1733">00:28:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's an open source server design or basically things like Memcache,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=1739">00:28:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it was probably our earliest project that I worked on.

You,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=2864">00:47:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you post photos on Instagram and Facebook and, you know, and WhatsApp and messenger.

I mean, to me, advertisement when done well, just finds a good match between a human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=2953">00:49:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">being and a thing that will make that human being happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=2956">00:49:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=2958">00:49:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And do that as efficiently as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=2961">00:49:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">When it's done well, people actually like it. You know, it's, um, yeah, I think that there's a lot of examples where it's not done well and it's annoying and I think that that's what kind of gives it a bad rap. But, um, but yeah, and a lot of the stuff is possible today. I mean, obviously AB testing stuff is built into a lot of these frameworks. The thing that's new is having technology that can generate the ideas for you about what to AB test. So I think that that's exciting. So this will just be a little bit of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=2983">00:49:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just be across like everything that we're doing, right? All the metaverse stuff that we're doing, right? It's like you want to create worlds in the future. You'll just describe them and then it'll create the code for you. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=2993">00:49:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so natural language becomes the interface we use for all the ways we interact with the computer with with the digital</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3003">00:50:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">more of them. Yeah, yeah, totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3005">00:50:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, which is what everyone can do using natural language and with translation, you can do it in any kind of language. Um, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3013">00:50:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for the personalization is really, really, really interesting. Yeah, it unlocks so many possible things. I mean, I, for one, look forward to creating a copy of myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3023">00:50:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I know we talked about this last time, but this has since the last time this becomes our closer, much closer. Like I could literally just having interacted with some of these language models. I can see the absurd situation where I'll have a large or a lex language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3043">00:50:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">model, and I'll have to have a conversation with him about like, Hey, listen, like you're just getting out of line and having a conversation where you fine tune that thing to be a little bit more respectful or something like this. And yeah, that's, that's going to be the, that seems like an amazing product for businesses for humans, just not, not just the assistant that's facing the individual, but the assistant that represents the individual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3073">00:51:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to the public, both, both directions. There's basically a layer that is the AI system through which you interact with the outside world, with the outside world that has humans in it. That's really interesting. And you that have social networks that connect billions of people, it seems like a heck of a large scale place to test some of this stuff out. Yeah, I mean, I think part of the reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3103">00:51:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">creators will want to do this is because they already have the communities on our services. Yeah. And, and, and a lot of the interface for this stuff today are chat type interfaces and, and between WhatsApp and, and messenger. I think that those are, you know, just great, great ways to, to interact with people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3133">00:52:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">these social networks on Facebook, on Instagram, even, even on WhatsApp, having, having conversations where some heterogeneous, some as humans, some as AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3144">00:52:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we'll get to that. You know, and, and, you know, if only just empirically looking at, then Microsoft released this thing called Xiaoice several years ago in China, it was a pre-LLM chatbot technology that, so it was a lot simpler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3163">00:52:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think that there's, there's, you know, there's certainly, you know, needs for companionship that people have, you know, older people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3192">00:53:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think most people probably don't have as many friends as they would like to have, right? If you look at, there's some interesting demographic studies around that, like the average person has the number of close friends that they have is fewer today than it was 15 years ago. And I mean, that gets to like, this is like the core thing that, that I think about in terms of, you know, building services that help connect people. So I think you'll get tools to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3222">00:53:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3252">00:54:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3282">00:54:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3312">00:55:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3342">00:55:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3372">00:56:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3402">00:56:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, I think it's mostly good. I mean, that was, that question was sort of framed in a negative way, but I mean, we were talking before about language models helping you communicate with, it was like language translation, helping you communicate with people who don't speak your language. I mean, at some level, what all this social technology is doing is helping people express themselves better to people in situations where they would have to be able to communicate with people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=3432">00:57:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span

sources, pressure from work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4732">01:18:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">From

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4742">01:19:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's, um, meta's approach to, um, to resist the pressure from governments and other interest

don't know that there's like a one size fits all answer to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4759">01:19:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think we basically have the principles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4762">01:19:22.880</a></span> | <span

build tools to try to moderate those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4780">01:19:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So then the question is, okay, what do you do when a government says that they don't want something on, on the service?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4789">01:19:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we have, we have a bunch of, uh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4792">01:19:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, principles around how we deal with that, because on, on the one hand, if there's a, you know, democratically elected government and people around the world just have different values and different places, then, you know, should we, as a, you know, California based company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4809">01:20:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Tell them that something that they have decided is unacceptable, actually, like that we need to be able to, to, to, to express that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4820">01:20:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think that that's, there's a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4822">01:20:22.720</a></span> | <span

class="t">Um, but then I think that there are other cases where, you know, it's, it's like a little more autocratic and, you know, you have the dictator leader who's just trying to crack down on descent and, you know, the people in a country are really, um, not aligned with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

leading it is, is just trying to push in a certain direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4849">01:20:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, these are very complex questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4852">01:20:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, but I, I think, so it's, it's difficult to have, have a one size fits all, um, approach to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4861">01:21:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But in general, we're, we're pretty active in, in kind of advocating and pushing back on, on, um, requests to take things down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4870">01:21:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but honestly, the thing that I think a request to censor things is one thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4877">01:21:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that's obviously bad, but where we, um, draw a much harder line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4882">01:21:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, is on requests for access to information, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4885">01:21:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, if you can, if you get told that you can't say something, I mean, that's bad, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4892">01:21:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that, that, you know, is, is, you know, obviously it violates your sense and freedom of expression at some level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4900">01:21:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But, um, but a government getting access to data in a way that seems, um, like it would be unlawful in, in, in our country, um, exposes people to real physicality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4912">01:21:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that's something that in general we take very seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4919">01:21:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, so there's, that flows through like all of our policies and in a lot of ways, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4924">01:22:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's by the time you're actually like litigating with a government or pushing back on them, that's pretty late in the funnel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4931">01:22:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say a bunch of this stuff starts a lot higher up in the decision of where do we put data centers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4938">01:22:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, there are a lot of countries where, you know, we may have a lot of people using the service in a place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4944">01:22:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be, you know, good for the service in some ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4947">01:22:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, good for those people if we could reduce the latency by having a data center nearby them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4953">01:22:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, for whatever reason, we just feel like, hey, this government does not have a good track record on, on, um, basically not trying to get access to people's data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4966">01:22:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the end of the day, I mean, if you put a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4968">01:22:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">data center in a country and the government wants to get access to people's data, then, you know, they do at the end of the day have the option of having people show up with guns and taking it by force.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4978">01:22:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that there's like a lot of decisions that go into like how you architect the systems, um, years in advance of, of these actual confrontations that end up being really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4991">01:23:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So you put the protection of people's data as a very, very high priority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=4998">01:23:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But in that, I think is a, there are more harms that I think can be associated with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5001">01:23:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and I think that that ends up being a more critical thing to defend against governments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5006">01:23:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, then, you know, whereas, you know, if another government has a different view of what should be acceptable speech in their country, especially if it's a democratically elected government and, you know, it's then I think that there's a certain amount of deference that you should have to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5020">01:23:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, uh, that's speaking more to the direct harm that's possible when you give governments access to data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5027">01:23:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we look at the United States to the more nuanced kind of pressure to censor, not even order to censor, but pressure to censor from political entities, which has kind of received quite a bit of attention in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5041">01:24:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, maybe one way to ask that question is if you've seen the Twitter files, uh, what have you learned from the kind of, uh, pressure from us government agencies that was seen in Twitter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5057">01:24:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And what do you do with that kind of pressure?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5060">01:24:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I mean, I've, I've, I've seen it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5063">01:24:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's really hard from the outside to know exactly what happened in each of these cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5070">01:24:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we've, we've obviously been, been in a bunch of our own cases where, you know, where agencies or different folks will, will just say, Hey, here's a threat that we're aware of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5085">01:24:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You should be aware of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5087">01:24:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You should be aware of this too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5088">01:24:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not really pressure as much as it is just, um, you know, flagging something that, that our, our security systems should be on, on alert about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5097">01:24:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I get how some people could think of it as that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5100">01:25:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but at the end of the day, it's our, it's our call on how to, on, on how to handle that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5107">01:25:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But I mean, I, I just, you know, in terms of running these services won't have access to as much information about what people think that adversaries might be trying to do as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5114">01:25:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Wait, so you don't feel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5117">01:25:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there will be consequences if, uh, you know, anybody, the CIA, the FBI, a political party, the Democrats or the Republicans of high powerful political figures, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5130">01:25:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Emails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5130">01:25:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't feel pressure from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5133">01:25:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess what I say is there's so much pressure from all sides that I'm not sure that any specific thing that someone says is really adding that much more to the mix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5143">01:25:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, um, there are obviously a lot of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5147">01:25:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Who think that, um, that we should be censoring more content, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5152">01:25:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a lot of people who think we should be censoring less content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5154">01:25:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There are, as you say, all kinds of different groups that are involved in these debates, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5159">01:25:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's the kind of elected officials and politicians themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5163">01:26:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the agencies, but, but I mean, but there's the, the media, um, there's activist groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5168">01:26:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, um, this is not a us specific thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5171">01:26:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There are groups all over the world and, and, and kind of all, um, in every country that, that bring different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5177">01:26:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5177">01:26:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so it's, it's just a very, it's a very active debate and I, and I understand it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5183">01:26:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, these are, you know, these, these kind of questions get to really some of the most important social debates that, that, that are, that are being had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5192">01:26:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, I think it's back to the question of truth because for a lot of these things, they haven't yet been hardened into a single truth and, um, society sort of trying to hash out what, um, you know, what we think, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5206">01:26:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">On.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5207">01:26:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">On, on, on certain issues, maybe in a few hundred years, everyone will look back and say, Hey, no, it wasn't an obvious that it should have been this, but you know, no, we're, we're kind of in the, in that meat grinder now and, you know, and, and, and working through that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5219">01:26:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, so no, these are, these are all are all very complicated and, you know, some people raise concerns in good faith and just say, Hey, this is something that I want to flag for you to think about certain people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5236">01:27:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5237">01:27:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly think like come at things with a somewhat of a more kind of punitive or vengeful view of like, I, like, I want you to do this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5246">01:27:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't, then I'm going to try to make your life difficult and, and a lot of other ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5250">01:27:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But like, I don't know, there, there's just, this is like, this is one of the most pressurized debates I think in society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5257">01:27:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I, I just think that there are so many people in different forces that are trying to apply pressure from different sides that it's, I, I, I don't think you can make decisions based on trying to make people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5266">01:27:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5267">01:27:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you just have to do what you think is the right balance and accept that people are going to be upset no matter where you come out on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5276">01:27:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5277">01:27:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I like that pressurized debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5279">01:27:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so how's your view of the freedom of speech evolved over the years?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5283">01:28:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and now with AI where the freedom might apply to them, not just to the humans, but to the, uh, the personal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5297">01:28:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5297">01:28:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I, I've probably gotten a somewhat more nuanced view just because I think that there are, you know, I, I come at this, I'm obviously very pro freedom of expression, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5307">01:28:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think you build a service like this that gives people tools to express themselves unless you think that people expressing themselves at scale is a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5314">01:28:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5314">01:28:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I, I didn't get into this to like, try to prevent people from, from expressing anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5320">01:28:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I like want to give people tools so they can express as much as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5323">01:28:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I think that's, that's a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5326">01:28:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's become clear that there are certain categories of things that we've talked about that I think almost everyone accepts are, are bad and that no one wants and that they're, that are illegal, even in countries like the US where, you know, you have the, the first amendment that's very protective of, of, of enabling speech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5344">01:29:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, you're still not allowed to, you know, do things that are gonna immediately incite violence or, you know, violate people's intellectual property or things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5351">01:29:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are those, but then there's also a very active core of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5355">01:29:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Just.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5356">01:29:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Active disagreements in society where some people may think that something is true or false.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5361">01:29:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The other side might think it's the opposite or just unsettled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=5366">01:29:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div

handle, like, like we've talked about, but, um, one of the lessons that I feel like I've learned is that a lot of times when you can, the best way to handle this stuff.</span></div><div

Mixed reality is also a predecessor to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7413">02:03:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">eventually we will get AR glasses that are not the goggles form factor of the current</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7418">02:03:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">generation of headsets that people are making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7421">02:03:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think a lot of the experiences that developers are making for mixed reality of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7426">02:03:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">basically you just have a kind of a hologram that you're putting in the world will hopefully apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7430">02:03:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">once we get the AR glasses too.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7493">02:04:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">take everything with a grain of salt, but a few high level thoughts. I mean, first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7499">02:04:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I do think that this is a certain level of validation for the category, right? Where,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7510">02:05:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we were the primary folks out there before saying, "Hey, I think that this, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7516">02:05:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, this is going to be a big part of the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7520">02:05:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">computing platform." I think having Apple come in and share that vision will make a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7532">02:05:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">who are fans of their products really consider that. And then, you know, of course the $35,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7540">02:05:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">$3,500 price, you know, on the one hand, I get it for with all the stuff that they're trying to pack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7546">02:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in there. On the other hand, a lot of people aren't going to find that to be affordable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7550">02:05:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that there's a chance that them coming in actually increases demand for the overall space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7557">02:05:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and that Quest 3 is actually the primary beneficiary of that because a lot of the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7562">02:06:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">who might say, "Hey, you know, this, I think I'm going to give another consideration to this." Or,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7568">02:06:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, "Now I understand why this is so important to me." You know, I think that's a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7569">02:06:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7569">02:06:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe what mixed reality is more, and Quest 3 is the best one on the market that I can afford.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7575">02:06:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's great also, right? I think that that's, you know, in our own way, I think we're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7581">02:06:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and there are a lot of features that we have where we're leading on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7583">02:06:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that that's, that I think is going to be a very, that could be quite good. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7592">02:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously over time, the companies are just focused on somewhat different things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7596">02:06:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple has always, you know, I think, you know, I think it's a good thing that they're doing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7599">02:06:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think focused on building really kind of high-end things. Whereas our focus has been on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7609">02:06:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just, we have a more democratic ethos. We want to build things that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7613">02:06:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">accessible to a wider number of people. You know, we've sold tens of millions of Quest devices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7619">02:06:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">My understanding, just based on rumors, I don't have any special knowledge on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7626">02:07:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is that Apple is building about 1 million of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7629">02:07:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of their device, right? So just in terms of like what you kind of expect in terms of sales numbers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7634">02:07:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I just think that this is, I mean, Quest is going to be the primary thing that people in the market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7644">02:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">will continue using for the foreseeable future. And then obviously over the long-term, it's up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7647">02:07:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the companies to see how well we executed the different things that we're doing. But we kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7651">02:07:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of come at it from different places. We're very focused on social interaction, communication,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7659">02:07:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">being more active, right? So there's fitness, there's gaming, there are those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7663">02:07:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas I think a lot of the use cases that you saw in Apple's launch material were more around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7671">02:07:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">people sitting, people looking at screens, which are great. I think that you will replace your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7678">02:07:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">laptop over time with a headset. But I think in terms of kind of how the different use cases that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7684">02:08:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the companies are going after, they're a bit different for what they're doing. I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7688">02:08:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a good thing for where we are right now. Yeah. So gaming wasn't a big part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7692">02:08:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">presentation, which is interesting. It feels like mixed reality gaming is such a big part of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7700">02:08:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It was interesting to see it missing in the presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7704">02:08:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, look, there are certain design trade-offs in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7707">02:08:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">where, you know, they made this point about not wanting to have controllers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7713">02:08:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which on the one hand, there's a certain elegance about just being able to navigate the system with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7719">02:08:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">eye gaze and hand tracking. And by the way, you'll be able to just navigate Quest with your hands too,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7724">02:08:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if that's what you want. Yeah. One of the things I should mention is that the capability from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7731">02:08:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">cameras with computer vision to detect certain aspects of the hand, allowing you to have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7736">02:08:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">controller that doesn't have that ring thing. Yeah. The hand tracking in Quest 3 and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7741">02:09:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">controller tracking is a big step up from the last generation. And one of the demos that we have has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7748">02:09:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">basically an MR experience teaching you how to play piano, where it basically highlights the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7753">02:09:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">notes that you need to play. And it's like, it's just all, it's hands, it's no controllers. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7756">02:09:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you care about gaming, having a controller allows you to have a more tactile feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7765">02:09:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and allows you to capture fine motor movement much more precisely than what you can do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7774">02:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hands without something that you're touching. So again, I think it's, there are certain questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7778">02:09:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which are just around what use cases are you optimizing for? I think if you want to play games,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7785">02:09:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">then I think that you want to design the system in a different way. And we're more focused on kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7792">02:09:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">social experiences, entertainment experiences. Whereas if what you want is to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7799">02:09:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the text that you read on a screen is as crisp as possible, then you need to make the design and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7807">02:10:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">cost trade-offs that you're doing. And that's something that I think is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7807">02:10:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that there is a use case for that for sure. But I just think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7815">02:10:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the companies, we've basically made different design trade-offs to get to the use cases that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7822">02:10:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we're trying to serve. There's a lot of other stuff I'd love to talk to you about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7827">02:10:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about the metaverse, especially the Kodak Avatar, which I've gotten to experience a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7833">02:10:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of different variations of recently that I'm really, really excited about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7837">02:10:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">To talk about that too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7838">02:10:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll have to wait a little bit because, well, I think there's a lot more to show off in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ&t=7846">02:10:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">regard. But let me step back to AI.
