amazing to see the progress that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heYmh_lsX5s&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">has happened over the last decade and we're at a an amazing time right now so um one thing to keep in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heYmh_lsX5s&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mind is that there was like a previous version of voice ai and it was kind of you know voice ai 1.0</span></div><div class="c"><span

that is llms you can put any text into it and uh depending on how the model is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heYmh_lsX5s&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">trained you can output any text and so if you're having a voice ai conversation you can take the audio</span></div><div class="c"><span

is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heYmh_lsX5s&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">everywhere the way i

it works today there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heYmh_lsX5s&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a um speech to
