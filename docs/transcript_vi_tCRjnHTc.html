The American founding fathers realized they had a tremendous problem. In fact, they thought they were the defenders of the British constitution and that the British king had violated it. They wanted to be democratic. So the whole thing that they instituted was immensely sophisticated.</p><p>It's an amazing intellectual achievement. But the inherent flaws are there. And one of them is the fact that there are checks and balances means that responsibility is dissipated and nobody is ever to blame for anything in the American system. In the British system, blame is absolutely focused. Everything is sacrificed to the end of focusing blame and responsibility down to the government.</p><p>And there are no systems that do that better.</p></div></div></body></html>
