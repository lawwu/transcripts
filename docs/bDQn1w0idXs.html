how you guys thought about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that choice yeah so there are a couple of different dimensions to it for us so we are you know a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow orchestration company and our our main user persona are data engineers and data scientists but</span></div><div class="c"><span

one dimension for us is right we assume that a big component of ai use cases were going to be data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">driven right like semantic search or like retrieval summarization these sorts of things so just we wanted to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.080</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like were there any new etl considerations when you're you know moving data between maybe vector databases or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something so that was one thing uh another one that uh i think is interesting is when when i look at ai</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going into production i see basically a remote api that is expensive brittle and non-deterministic and</span></div><div class="c"><span

workflows that are building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">applications for data engineers presumably a lot of that's going to translate over and so and i mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

fun and so we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to learn in the open so we did end up just kind of creating a new repo uh called marvin that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">i think jason mentioned in his last talk um just to kind of keep up you know be incentivized to keep up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and brian you were literally brought on board to hex to focus on this stuff would love to hear more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about how that decision was made and how you've spent your time on it yeah i think a couple things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one is that data science is this unique interface between sort of like like business acumen creativity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and like pretty like difficult sometimes programming and it turns out that like the opportunity to unlock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">more creativity and more business acumen as part of that workflow is a really unique opportunity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">i think a lot of data people um the favorite part of their job is not remembering that plot lib syntax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and so the opportunity to sort of like take away that tedium is a really exciting place to be also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">realistically um any data platform that isn't integrating ai is almost certainly going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">dooming themselves to the now and sort of it'll be table stakes pretty soon and so i think missing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity would be pretty criminal yeah i totally agree with that so you decided that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you were going to go ahead and do this you're going to go all in on ai what criteria did you evaluate when</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:04:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">existing resources what criteria did you consider when you were saying okay this is how we're actually</span></div><div class="c"><span

angles there's the kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just pure open source marvin project not you know it is a product but not one that we sell just one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that we maintain um and then we do have some ai features built into our actual core product and i think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">uh they have slightly different success criteria so for marvin it's mainly just um getting a to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">how people are experimenting with llms and just talking to users directly right it just kind of gives us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that avenue and that audience and so that's just been really useful and insightful for us so we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">get on the phone i

target="_blank">00:05:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">day um and then for our core product so one way that i i love to think about dev tools and think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what we build is uh failure modes so like i like to think of choosing tools for what happens when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they fail can i quickly recover from that failure and understand it and so a lot of our features are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">geared towards that sort of kind of discoverability and so for ai it's kind of the same thing it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span

relatively straightforward right it's like how quickly are users kind of getting to the pages they want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and how quickly are they uh debugging their workflows so like very quantifiable yeah

a second if you have any last questions to ask of each other yeah um so you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">work on this like data workflow space and like i've thought a lot about composability and like data</span></div><div class="c"><span

and so what i what i'd love to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">hear is sort of like when you think about building these agent pipelines which are starting to get more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">into the like dags and the sort of like structured chains of response and uh request what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like one thing that like every ai engineer building agents should know from your sphere that that'll make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it easier for them to build agents so oh that's a really good question i don't i think the main thing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something that i kind of alluded to earlier which is think about failure modes i think that is the biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">thing so like runaway processes um capturing potential oddities in outputs or inputs as early as possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with some observability layer um and so the earlier you can get that wiring in i think the better um and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">then caching is like this is the only time i will ever say this is definitely your

but there's also the root of all evils so you got to kind of you know balance that um but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah i think just thinking about the observability and debuggability layer especially with some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of black boxy and like people who are pushing it and actually

everybody asks you this but the hallucination problem like how you know obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you your users can just confront it directly if it looks weird they can see that it looks weird or it</span></div><div class="c"><span

that interface for your users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah um someone recently asked me for like references on hallucination and i was like what are some good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">references on hallucination and i googled around and i found that generally the advice that people are giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">giving is to is to fix hallucination basically rag harder just like make a better retrieval augmented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.360</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it like our reduction in hallucination for magic which is not an easy problem was that we had to think a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more carefully about retrieval augmented generation and in particular the retrieval is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something that you'll find in any book um even the book that i just published like even in there i</span></div><div class="c"><span

us some additional thinking but we got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQn1w0idXs&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.560</a></span> | <span
