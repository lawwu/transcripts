But I started my PhD and wore my master's in graphs in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">2016, and it was not nearly as popular as it is now, and it's fascinating to see how far it's come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think it's important for me to define how we use them and how we think about them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Broadly, to me, graphs are relations. That's part of the visual element, and there's a back-end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">element as well. But it's the benefit of using graphs is that I can see what is connected to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something else. I can be explicit about what is connected to something else, and I can do mass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">analytics on what is connected to something else.

And when I use relations, it's not necessarily node to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">node. It can be node to node to node. It can be multi-hop. It can be as varied and as forked and as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">distributed as you want. This is why we use graphs in our process. Broadly, throughout the process of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">running this company and previously as an academic, this is what I think is easy about graphs. People look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">them and go, well, that's fantastic. I have a great understanding of what this is. And someone else says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">me too. And there isn't necessarily a consistency in what those two people just said. They may have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">different understanding of what is represented. Broadly, throughout my career, these are the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that are difficult about graphs, right? And you can say that they're nodes connected to edges. You can say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they're distributed. You can say they're backed up. There's a variety of ways in which people use the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that they have, the way they store it and the way they talk about it. And now, as graphs have become very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">necessary and consistent for things like graph rag, for things like structured data, etc., more and more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">people are coming to this relatively niche area previously that even at the time wasn't necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">agreed upon what it was. So, I do like to define what it is we're using. So, graphs and multi-agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">systems. These are the two things that I want to define as there's a variety of ways that people use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is how we use multi-agent systems, right? So, now, multi-agent systems are all the way from very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically define what you're dealing with and chain those together and use an LLM to glue it all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">together. Or it is, in our case, break down a complicated white-collar workflow down into a specific set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">steps that I can I/O test, right? And each of those steps have different requirements, different frequencies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">different state, and that state can be controlled often, in our case, by a graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is why we like to use them. When we're building an application for the legal industry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure if you guys know this, but lawyers don't really like when things are incorrect, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It is basically the whole industry is make this very specifically correct and proper and definitely in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the right language. So, when it comes to building applications, probabilistic large language models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">don't necessarily work for that just in isolation.

And we've heard about multi -- well, at least I've heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about multi-agent systems a lot. I'm sure other people have as well. Sometimes the part in the workflow is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">much more important than the other part. Sometimes there's parts in the workflow I don't particularly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">care about. There are also agents in the world. Agents imply that these things are very capable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but I can write a bad prompt very easily, and all of a sudden I have a bad agent. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">when it comes to what is the agent that I trust, very few. We spend a lot of time guard railing as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">much as we possibly can. We spend time making so that the memory is not just immediate, but it's episodic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We spend time capturing the information state over time and then pruning that state. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to bring it back, capturing, expanding, pruning, structuring, and then querying state for us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">happens in a graphical format. Because the necessity of having the structure, having the extendability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and then having the ability to remove that extension is really important for us. And then finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm trying not to make this too deep depth and too many numbers, but 95% accuracy for a single agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, is a tall order at this point. Maybe people have entirely accurate agents. I'm very happy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for you. I don't have that exactly right now. I have systems that I can put in place, like guardrails and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">humans in the loop, that can bring these agents to a point that it is accurate enough that people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">willing to use them. However, five 95% accurate agents chained together sequentially, that's 77% expected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">accurate accuracy. That's not that many agents in a row. If you think about a workflow, that's five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">steps. And if I'm basically saying that if each of those five steps are 95% accurate, already quite a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">hard thing to ask, especially if there's an LLM involved.

That is part of, probably, if I was to summarize my main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">problem with that.

That's the background. That's how we understand these systems. We use multi-agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">systems and we're naturally skeptical.

So I am using the term agent because everyone's using the term agent. We build litigation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">agents.

Put that harm all in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">place and then sue a pharmaceutical company. Now, we don't do any of the litigating as a company or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">suing, but we do support the lawyers who do that. We do that in a few different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is one of the ways that we look at the legal industry, right?

There's also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">once you have that correct format, creative arguments.

However, there is a legal limit as to how much information they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">can capture from me, right? And you cannot surpass that legal limit, or you can, but then you can go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">into the process of litigation. Now, if you surpass that, there needs to be a precedent as to why someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">could say, "You cannot capture this much information." And the particular precedent I'm referring to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is many years ago, Blockbuster was sued by keeping too many details about the literal physical DVDs that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">people rented. That is a reasonably creative way to say, "Look, I remember that Blockbuster happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and what Netflix is doing isn't that different. It may be in a digital format, it may be at a larger scale,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it may be into an algorithm instead of someone who's recommending it. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that is an interesting application of what I'm doing." So, these problems then, which is necessary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">accuracy and then creativity on top of that accuracy, and then all of that information is kept in separate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">places, and a lot of that creativity comes from the latent knowledge in the expert's head, starts to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to a bit of a fall when you say, "Well, I have these probabilistic agents that you could argue aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that creative." Right? I have these agents that most of the time do a pretty good job and can be creative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in a way that, frankly, can be quite frustrating, especially to a lawyer. So, this butts heads in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of exactly how lawyers want to deal with this information. And again, I'm painting a very broad brush.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not a lawyer.

Now, that is a challenge at the moment. A lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">time it's manually reviewed.

That's where things like structured information and graphs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all of a sudden, a different lawyer can have a different multi-agent system and a different graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that backs up their specific way that they like to work, as opposed to having a compromise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">previously on the way that everyone else liked to work to maybe hear something if they can. And from there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">once we've honed down just to the signals that they care about, the qualified signals that are specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to them, that signal can then further generate a report, and that report can be entirely specific to the lawyer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. So when it comes to report generation, again, a multi-agent system that's backed up by a schema, and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">schema is consistent and pruned, and that schema looks like a controlled state with a graph that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">build the report that the lawyer wants. And every report is going to be different, but the structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be the same for each lawyer, and each lawyer has a different process. What I'm broadly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">describing is mass scraping the web down to a specific signal generated just for the lawyer. It's entirely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">personalized service that's been automated. And that is the process of what we do, and this is part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">how we are able to manage and use state and graphs and multi-agent systems to bring the information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">together. Cool. I'm going to go through -- I think I have one case study that I want to describe, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">conscious of time. This happens. It's not great. No one really wants it to. There may be situations in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which there's a bunch of people who bought a car who really wanted it to catch fire. We don't necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">deal with them. What we do find is that there are people who are driving their car, and it starts to smoke,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it catches fire. That's not the behavior that they intended to happen. It was not on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">brochure when they bought it. It's not what they want. Those people immediately go and complain, as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they should. They go to government website. They go to carcomplaints.com. They're on a specific subreddit or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">forum. And once we can start to track that, which we can, and once we can start to scrape and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">structure and then schematize and then analyze, we can start to basically build a density of complaints for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">specific vehicle, for a specific year, for a specific problem. And that density is a combination of how many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">complaints multiplied by the velocity of complaints, so a certain amount per month over a number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">months. All of a sudden, we get to the point where we're finding these leads particularly early. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">now, as we're building models, we're starting to find these leads early and earlier, and that we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily need the velocity straight away. We can start to figure out what are the previous lawsuits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which were all public and very well documented, and exactly what happened in that process. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for a large law firm, maybe eight or nine months post people starting to complain, they can take that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">lawsuit on if they want to. For us, we can find it within about 15 minutes. And then generally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it takes probably a month for you to be confident that this is the signal that you want. And so we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">find things significantly earlier. That process, again, scraping the web, filtering down, producing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">specific report. This is an example that we did. And again, we deal with what the lawyers want. So this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">lawyer, again, he made the case that people's cars are catching flyers. They don't really want them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to. Those are the cases that he would like to take on. It's of a certain amount of money. It's of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">certain make and model. It's in a certain jurisdiction, et cetera. Those specific filters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that schema can be applied throughout the entire process. That's basically the graph. Each of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">lawyers have a specific graph that they want. And not just that, they can filter and feedback that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">information. So it's not just a static graph. I mean, the benefit of a graph structure, at least one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits of a graph structure, I should say, is that it's an extensible schema. And that I can update</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can query across and I can understand that information. So while we are dealing with RAG, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">would say we have less of a chat RAG interface. Well, the lawyers definitely do appreciate that. A lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what we have when it comes to RAG or retrieval augmented generation would be generating these reports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because as much as a lawyer does want an answer, what they also want is the form factor they're used to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all of these graphs are consistently made and built each day. And then some subgraph from that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">broader monolithic structure is then brought in and composed into a report that a lawyer can action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of what's next. And I'll talk about the future a little bit. I mean, what I described</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is kind of what we're doing. But this is what we're doing. Find law suits early, compensate harm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and then people can have that information if they want to. We're able to do this entirely technically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We're able to scrape the web structure, etc. We're able to iteratively build up a schema as we want to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is not just a Gen AI problem. And I think this is an important thing that I've seen around this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">conference and people may be seeing is that Gen AI is not better than machine learning. And LLMs are not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, better than traditional ML systems. But there are situations in which one is fantastic and one is not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at multi-agent systems, and again, I was previously an academic and multi-agent systems and no one ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">listened to me. So this is a bizarre situation. But that when you used to structure the multi-agent systems together, somewhere along that workflow, you would have to stop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or say this is not doable, because I cannot plug these two bits of information together. It's too probabilistic, or it's too random, or it's too inconsistent, or the way to describe it is not a binary feature, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It is, I really just want to kind of type what I want, right? Now with LLMs, you can. But it's very much for us, not an LLM filtered system. It's an ML filtered system that LLMs have allowed us to pipe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">together such that you can actually provide value completely end to end, which I think was previously not doable. And for us, again, we've been using graphs for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">For us, the ability to iteratively build that graph, prune that graph, and every single report gets better, because we're able to manage the state, is why people like working with us, because we can consistently follow and track exactly what they want specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. I think I'm just about at time, kind of got in early, but that's been the talk specifically around -- I'm happy to talk to anyone about the specifics, graph rag, et cetera, multi-agent systems, but that's how we use the process. Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxr6LdXNWM&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll be right back.</span></div></div></body></html>
