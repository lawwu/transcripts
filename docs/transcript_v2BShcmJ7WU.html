And you can use a credit card to buy gift cards. And you know, speculation is that Pepper's raised so much venture capital money that they're subsidizing gift cards at a pretty aggressive level. You earn Pepper points when you buy gift cards and you can use them to buy more gift cards, which just saying it out loud sounds ridiculous.</p><p>But you can earn upwards of like 12% back on Amazon, buying Amazon gift cards, but you earn it in the form of Pepper points. And so the answer is like, what do you do with them? You buy more gift cards. That is the only thing I know you could do with Pepper points.</p><p>But if you're looking at trying to offset when you buy things so that you can get a better deal and you're willing to take on some risk that the extra points, these bonus points, sometimes they say will pay out 4% now and another 8% in two weeks. Obviously Pepper goes out of business in two weeks.</p><p>You're not gonna get that 8%. But yeah, Pepper is interesting app for buying gift cards.</p></div></div></body></html>
