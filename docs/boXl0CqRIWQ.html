Speaking of getting the full picture there is one tool that I want to introduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you to before the end of this video. It's a tool I've been using for over 18 months now and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are the sponsors of today's video. It's a tiny startup called Emergent Mind because sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">believe it or not there are papers that I miss as I scour the interwebs for what new breakthrough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">happened this hour. It's hyper optimized for AI papers and archive in particular. Yes you can chat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">through any paper using any of the models you can see on screen but as someone who likes to read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">papers manually I'll tell you what I use Emergent Mind for as a pro user. I can basically see if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">there's any paper that I've missed that has caught fire online. You can click on it and something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">quite fascinating happens. Of course you get a link to the PDF but you can also see reaction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on social media which is quite nice for building your appetite for reading a paper. Not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Twitter of course but Hacker News, GitHub and YouTube. More than once I have seen my own videos</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">linked at the bottom.

The legendary Andrej Karpathy tweeted out five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">examples of where he thought GPT 4.5 had done better than GPT 4 and then put a poll about which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">model people preferred. They didn't see which model it was just saw the outputs.

But yes in summary I'm going to say my reaction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is mixed rather than necessarily negative.

So when OpenAI and others of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">course with their own base models unleash the full power of billion dollar runs of reinforcement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">learning to instantiate reasoning into those better base models then frankly who knows what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boXl0CqRIWQ&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">will result.
