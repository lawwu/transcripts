Now Paul's position in Galatians is that circumcision is of no effect. And then he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_xhY7SwlE&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 5, verse 6, "In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_xhY7SwlE&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">anything, in spite of the command in the Old Testament to be circumcised.
