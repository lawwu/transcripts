I want one of these. Dave is obsessed with Palomas. I love Palomas. I'm into Palomas right now. I'm a Paloma guy right now. It's like the all-in intro do you think? Yep. Which I've done a live arrangement for with the brass.</p><p>Now, we're not going to do a year-in-review discussion. We're just going to go right into... Right. I think we caught it. Yeah, we're going to go right into the awards. Well, you're going to go right into Santa Catas doing this bit. Yeah. We could do that. That's easy. That could be the change line.</p><p>Exactly. How much time does he need to change? It's me! Santa Catas! That's good. Yeah. I mean it's pretty hilarious. So, we're really excited to have some Bestie Awards to give out tonight. Let's get started. Jake, how are you? Are you back? Are you here? Where are you? Oh, God.</p><p>Sorry. I was just getting in founder mode. Woo! Let's go! Saturday Night San Francisco! All right, J-Kel, you want to warm us up? Okay. All right, everybody. Let's get loose. We know what we do. We have a game plan. We've been doing this for 206 episodes. We're not changing anything.</p><p>We are who we are. We know what to do. Frank Burt, bring that science. Sax, I got the red meat for you. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me.</p><p>And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me.</p><p>And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me.</p><p>And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. And you're going to help me. Let's go. America, 2024. A year of political earthquakes.</p><p>Extraordinary market events. War. Space. And the revelation that Diddy is super into baby oil. Authority has located more than a thousand bottles of baby oil lubricant. It was a year so profound. Gotta give him that hawk poo and spit on that thing. America was at times at a loss for words.</p><p>Look, um, the, uh, like I said, I'm-- Well put, gentle Joe. So tonight, we look back. The All In Podcast presents America 2024. What in the fuck just happened? The story of 2024 starts with AI. The revolutionary technology has fueled a boom in countless sectors. But mostly, the legal field.</p><p>Scarlett Johansson's legal team wants details on exactly how they were able to create that voice that sounds like she said, so eerily similar. No, it sounds just like her. Of course, it's a digitally altered version of Scargent. And they got caught. OK. Cookie jar. And AI also created the most remarkable deepfake video ever.</p><p>Welcome. They almost look like friends. Amazing. Yes, 2024 proved there's no problem AI can't solve and/or cause. Google has had to pause AI-made images, quote, after race inaccuracies. This year, AI helped launch the most drool-worthy tech product in years. A computer chip. Yeah, baby. DGX has become the essential instrument of AI.</p><p>Never seen anything like this in the history of Silicon Valley or corporate America. NVIDIA is king of the AI revolution, and they're so hot, they're literally too hot. The information reported that the chips are overheating in servers. But don't worry, there's an elegant solution to the problem. I bought myself this Hiroshima mask so I do not have to smell the burn on those conductors.</p><p>Problem solved. But NVIDIA wasn't alone in AI news. OpenAI was at the forefront of reinventing another crucial industry, office drama. A lot of drama involving OpenAI. What a mess. What's next? This week on General AI Hospital. Is Sam Altman's job security in jeopardy? Whose data was stolen this time?</p><p>What did Ilya see? Why isn't he talking about it? And with our special guest. Will our special guest get her revenge? General AI Hospital. But Sam Altman never let the drama distract him from OpenAI's primary mission, philanthropy. It's actually really important that you're not doing private enrichment off philanthropic donations.</p><p>And so, you know, it's, it's... But isn't that what's happened? Um, you know, I think that the, you know, um, you know, I think, like I said, sour grapes. Well said, Reed. But even if OpenAI was a little more like closed AI, its humble leader, Sam Altman, was still toiling away humbly for the betterment of mankind.</p><p>You make a lot of money, do you? I make, no, uh, I'm paid enough for health insurance, I have no equity in OpenAI. Really? That's interesting. But don't think this working class hero doesn't suffer. Did you know that his 1.9 million dollar supercar wasn't available in candy apple red like he wanted?</p><p>Still, it wouldn't be a year in review without mentioning Elon Musk. Who, incidentally, we will all be required to mention daily in 2025 as bound by federal law. The world's jumpiest capitalist and the new co-leader of the free world showed everyone in 2024 that being Elon Musk is a pretty fucking sweet gig.</p><p>From soaring in space to delivering charity, from business booms to getting anointed by Joe Rogan as free speech Jesus, from getting hired in politics to getting hired to fire people in politics, 2024 was a year that couldn't shake Elon Musk. Just ask this guy. You know, he likes this place.</p><p>I can't get him out of here. And it was all prophesized by our own David Palpatine. Everything has proceeded as I have foreseen. 2024 was a banner year in tech. And in how many giant names we tricked into coming on our podcast. I love that house he has. I love David's house.</p><p>I can't believe I get to sit down with one of the most famous investors in Uber. It was like the hand of God massaging my central nervous system. What the flying f**k happened? If you have specific questions, I'm happy to. Did somebody stab you in the back? Did you find AGI?</p><p>Oh my God, what have we done inviting these lunatics on the program? Hold on guys, I got to get into founder mode. Oh wow, founder mode. If he founder modes, I'm going to, I'm going to founder. S**t, I got to founder mode too. Ah. Where's Jayco? Oh s**t. Speaking of financial highs, 2024 experienced a wide range of viewpoints from the effectiveness of ESG to disagreement on new CTA BOI reporting.</p><p>But there was unanimous agreement on one key financial issue. Lina Khan has become the most aided and feared person on Wall Street. And Lina Khan is utterly ineffective. What Lina Khan has done is just go after "bigness" which just means stopping these companies from doing anything that would make them bigger.</p><p>The only acquisition she couldn't stop, Chamath's $5,000 sweater habit. Oh yeah, Chamath, strut your stuff. Let's talk about the sweaters. This, Jason. Oh, really? Is the thin summer gilet. Okay, beautiful cashmere. Cashmere? F**k yeah! These days, the all-in boys and their friends are looking slim in their cashmere thanks to a new class of miracle drugs that stormed the world of biotech in 2024.</p><p>Ozempic. The game-changer. Injectable weight loss drugs are hot. In our broker group, like, 4 of the 12 or 13 regulars are on it. 2025 is looking to be the year GLP-1s change the face of everything. Literally. But we've heard that term "ozempic face." First we had "ozempic face," and now we have "ozempic butt." But if 2024 will be remembered for one thing, it will be for shining a light on elder abuse.</p><p>Our 46 presidents stepped aside, introducing the country to a fresh new upstart ready to tackle the problems of a fractured country. I grew up a middle-class kid. I grew up a middle-class kid. I grew up a middle-class kid. I grew up a middle-class kid. President Trump, however, wouldn't stand by idly and let Kabbalah torch her own campaign.</p><p>They're eating the dogs, the people that came in. They're eating the cats. In the end, however, it wasn't even close. Literally nothing? Literally nothing. Literally not one county? There was just so much to 2024 that we can't cover it all. From Trump nearly getting assassinated to Trump nearly getting assassinated.</p><p>From continued wars in Europe and the Middle East to continued battles on the home front. From the cringiest of TikToks to black Nazis and an Aussie dance legend, 2024 was anything but. Very demure. Very mindful. With 2024 in the rearview mirror, let's turn to our outgoing president for some sage advice on our collective future.</p><p>But I tell you what, I don't know about you, but I'm going to go to bed. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming your bestie. What's up? Merry Christmas. Welcome, CzarSax. You weren't allowed to say Merry Christmas until about three weeks ago. Merry fucking Christmas, everybody. Where's... Happy holidays.</p><p>Where's Jkal? Where's Jkal? Jkal? Jkal? Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! It is I, Santa Canis, here to spread joy and stock options and bitcoins to all these fine San Francisco they-thems-its-whatevers. Ho, ho, ho! This is starting off horribly, but OK. Ho, ho, ho! Shabbat! Ho, ho! Santa Canis, where are you coming from?</p><p>Well, you know, uh... You know they paid money for this, right? You could have at least memorized your lines. It's just too funny. Sometimes the cold opens work, and sometimes they don't. They don't. It's true. It's true. The problem is, this one's supposed to go for eight minutes, so...</p><p>Eight minutes? You have stuff in there for eight minutes? It's not like you guys are going to make this crowd laugh, OK? No, it's, uh... We moved the North Pole. We moved it. Where'd you move it to, Santa Canis? It's a problem, because, you know, all these elves who've come across the border up there...</p><p>Tons of fentanyl. It's a disaster. Terrible. And just crazy inflation up there. So we-we moved the North Pole down to Austin, Texas. Oh, it's-it's in Austin, Texas now. Yeah. Better tax treatment, you know. Can you get elves there, Santa Canis? You know, it's a little bit hard. Some of them have come across the border.</p><p>Some of them work hard. Other ones, not so much. Have you automated? Well, you know, it's interesting you say that. Oh, oh, no milk and cookies. I'll take some Bitcoin if you have any extra. OK. Thank you there, Tremont. Yes, we've done some automation. Ho, ho, ho, yes. Oh, here it is, everybody.</p><p>You know, we have a lot of problems with the elves. You know, they've been unionizing sacks. It's too much regulation, but we can get these here from 1X. Only $1 per hour, but we need you back in Santa's lab, OK? You need to be building some toys, OK? Now get back to work.</p><p>Yeah, we don't have HR anymore, OK? So what are you doing after? No, I mean, I got my friends, got the good K. OK, we'll talk later. Whose robot is this? It's Santa's robotic elf, right? Ho, ho, ho. Sorry, hold on a second. Hold on. Before we continue with this clearly incredible bit that you two ding-dongs wrote.</p><p>I was just told to read it. Can we just say a cheers for the new czar? Huzzah! Huzzah! Mazel tov, bro. Congratulations. Yes, congratulations there. Congratulations, czar. It's a little hard with the $27 Amazon Santa suit. Ho, ho, ho. Well, you know, guys, I have the list here that you guys were asking about.</p><p>This is the naughty list. This bit goes on for like eight minutes. Hold on. I've got the naughty and the nice list. It's a pretty big list this year. Let's take a look. Sam Altman is on the naughty list. Very naughty. Two, three, four times on the naughty list.</p><p>Oh, Jensen, also on the top of the list. You know, Santa's got a lot of that NVIDIA. 20 baggers so far. Yes, also some NVIDIA employees here. They didn't sponsor, though. Oh. I don't know why. He's so cheap. Okay, Santa, Kenneth, I think it's time for you to go back to Austin.</p><p>Yeah, well, you know, I have to do another podcast. Yeah, it's got 20 times the ratings of All In. It's called Hot Ones. I don't know who the host is, but you're getting beaten in the ratings by 12 chicken wings. Congratulations, boy. More work for you guys, okay? I'll see you next time.</p><p>Bye, everybody. Can you get Santa, Kenneth, out of here? Ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho. Okay. Well, you have to admire the dedication to the bit. Most people have given up after about two minutes. He just kept going with it. He's really committed. He keeps going, yeah.</p><p>That's great. So just to get you guys oriented, thank you all for being here. This is going to be awesome. We got a great night planned. We got a show. We're going to walk through the Bestie Awards tonight. It's going to be super fun. Oh, here we go. Sorry I'm late.</p><p>I was in an Uber. I was in an Uber. I heard Santa Claus showed up. I was in an Uber. Okay. Oh, sorry. Let's do a drinking game. The number of times J. Cal shills his companies, we need to drink. J. Cal, introduce the awards. Let's kick this off.</p><p>How's this going to work? Oh, okay. So you guys know we do this amazing Bestie Awards. So we're going to do a bunch of Bestie Awards here live on stage. And interestingly, this year we actually made a Bestie Award. It's right next to you, Chamath. Maybe you can hold one up.</p><p>Sax, go ahead and take a look at this. Now, this Bestie Award is two men embracing in a long, awkward hug. And many people don't know the inspiration for this awkwardness, but here it is to remind everybody. There it is. And that's actually Chamath and David Sax. David Sax is actually reciprocating the hug.</p><p>He actually reciprocates. You're saying that we were the mold for this. It was cast out of our body shapes. It's actually accurate down to the inch. Yes, it's very accurate. You and Sax, you and Chamath are hugging. So the first award we're going to do is business. Biggest winner, biggest loser, and biggest surprise.</p><p>So, Chamath, would you like to kick it off with your biggest business winner? I think the biggest business winner of 2024 is the business of speech. And what I mean by that is I think that we have made freedom of speech a very successful business model. All right, well done.</p><p>What's your biggest business winner, Sax? Well, I want it to be original, but I really couldn't. I thought it was so obvious this year it has to be Elon Musk. Okay, Elon Musk, that's always a safe choice. Freeberg, who do you have? It's SpaceX, Starlink, Starship. I don't know what else comes close.</p><p>Chopsticks. What's that? Chopsticks. First Neuralink implant. And SpaceX at like a $350 billion valuation, like tripling from that level in a year. It's insane. Never been done before. Boundaries just don't matter. It's incredible. It is incredible. I went with NVIDIA just to mix it up. Who's your biggest business loser, Sax?</p><p>I said the biggest business loser was the legacy media. Oh, mainstream media, okay. They lost the election in something like half their ratings, and they've been exposed as basically being overpaid podcasters. But podcasters aspire to be overpaid legacy media hosts. Chamath, who is your biggest business loser? Business loser, Intel.</p><p>From the company that basically commercialized Moore's Law for the advancement of humanity to just a totally confused shell of its former self. Who do you got, Freeberg, as your biggest business loser? Very old business. Has had a kind of mantle place position in the United States for decades. That would be Boeing, which seemed to unravel this year with obviously the debacle with the aerospace program, particularly with Starliner stranding some astronauts needing to get rescued.</p><p>And there's a lot of turnover happening in the organization. It just seems like a mess. You know, I went with Apple only because I felt the Vision Pro felt flat. The new iPhone 16, not very strong. And I feel like they're adrift. And Warren Buffett sold all his shares in it.</p><p>I feel like the company could do much better. Well, their stock's up like 30% this year. I think it's a little bit in the middle, but I think it's based on potential. I think they should be releasing great new products, and they aren't. Let's go to business surprise. Did you have a business surprise over there, Saxipoo?</p><p>I said Palantir was the biggest business surprise this year. I mean, I thought the company would do well, but its stock went up 5x this year from $16 a share to 76. Completely counterintuitive. It just--the market cap of Palantir just passed the market cap of Lockheed Martin. The amazing counterintuitive thing about Palantir was how much time they spent with their customers.</p><p>Everybody shat on that idea, and they were totally right. Totally right. So were they your biggest surprise as well? No. My biggest business surprise are GLP-1s. I think the number of markets that it seems to help-- this year it went from weight loss to cardiac fitness to depression to drug addiction, alcohol-- I mean, it's basically a wonder drug of wonder drugs.</p><p>And also, I think you might be interested, they said it can help with compulsive gambling as well, Chamath. That is why I am not on a GLP-1. I don't have a problem. Okay, Freeburg, did you have a surprise? I was surprised by the return of kind of the long tail of crypto.</p><p>Okay. It's come roaring back, and everything seems to be on fire again. No comment from the crypto czar, I know, but-- Crypto comeback is your big surprise. Crypto comeback. The long tail of crypto comeback. I feel like Bitcoin was always a different story, but the long tail's got a different story.</p><p>You know, I looked at it, and I always love great products. I picked Google. Everybody was talking two years ago about how Google was falling behind and 10 blue links weren't going to work. The Gemini app is absolutely fantastic. I've been using Gemini app. It's as good or better than-- Do you jay trade Google shares?</p><p>I jay trade some shares, yes. I jay traded some Google shares. Also, Waymo, also delightful. And, you know, they had a rough year with some of that woke imagery in Gemini, but I think they had a great rebound. Waymo's a really good story. Yeah, I think Waymo-- I also felt like it's like what is that business a year and a half ago, two years ago, and I don't know.</p><p>I've been taking Waymo's around the city. You don't come to the city. My sister and my brother-in-law are visiting this weekend. There they are. Hey, how you doing, guys? And they took a Waymo yesterday, and I saw the video. And basically what you have is my brother-in-law, who's, like, totally blown away, my sister, who's, like, cautiously optimistic, and their two kids who are, like, pinned to the back in fear because they're like, "Who is driving this?" And my brother-in-law, who's Indian, he's like, "Don't worry.</p><p>There are people like us somewhere driving this car."  Okay. Let's go to politics. Sax, here's your red meat. I can't imagine who you have as your political winner, but I know you probably struggled over this one. This one's pretty obvious. It's the man who won the White House. He--actually, he not only won the White House, he won the House, he won the Senate, he won the popular vote, and he overcame a hostile media.</p><p>He overcame two assassination attempts, one that missed him by millimeters. So my biggest political winner for the year is Donald Trump. Okay, there it is, folks. Biggest winner. Wow. You just glow. When you mention DJT, you're just glowing. We don't even need to like the stage. When we say DJT, it's like a fusion reactor.</p><p>Chamath, who is your biggest political winner for 2024? My biggest--and listen to this very carefully, folks. My biggest political winner of 2024 is David motherfucking Sax. Let's go, David Sax! Fuck yeah. Nicely done. All right. Say more, say more. Well, I said this before, but I'll say it again.</p><p>I've never seen a team of people assembled in any government like this, and I really do mean what I say. He is really the best of everything that happens. A guy that has emigrated, okay? A guy that's worked his ass off. He's done it in many different places, in many different ways.</p><p>He's an amazing friend, and he's fucking brilliant. And we need brilliant people. Yeah, way to go. Did you have a political winner there, Friedberg? I know you don't talk too much about politics. Well, I went with independent media. I think that it totally reinvented-- Everyone talks about this, but it had such a huge impact in changing the narrative, getting new messages out there that were being filtered or distracted away in other contexts, so I thought that was the biggest winner.</p><p>And everyone's talking about the legacy media anchors all leaving and moving to independent podcasting platforms and so on, so that was the biggest winner, I thought. All right, I picked the PayPal mafia, yourself included, of course, Sax, Peter Thiel, JD, and Elon, obviously. The whole group, I think, really did a great thing.</p><p>Now, whether you are a fan of Donald Trump's or not, if you're left or right, I feel really great that you guys are around Donald Trump, and I feel really optimistic and great energy for the country. So the fact that the PayPal mafia is there, yourself included, Sax, makes me feel really great about the next four years, and I'm so proud that you're doing this, and it's a great sacrifice for your country.</p><p>You could use these cycles for your own benefit, and you're using these cycles for the benefit of America and humanity, and I think that deserves a big round of applause. Okay. - Thank you. Well, you know, one thing I'll say is, Chamath and I co-hosted the dinner for President Trump.</p><p>It was on June 6th of this past year. I remember that because it was D-Day. I thought that was somehow significant. But they asked me if I would be willing to host a fundraiser for President Trump, and I said, "Well, how much do we need to raise?" And they said, "Well, at a minimum, $5 million." And I didn't--I thought maybe that's a hard number to raise because there's not that many Republicans in San Francisco.</p><p>So the first call I made was to this man, Chamath, and I said, "Would you co-host this with me?" Because I figured, okay, well, if nobody shows up, Chamath and I can just split it. - You dollar-cost-averaged your fundraiser? - Oh, that's so bad. - You dollar-cost-averaged. - So I knew he could pick up the check with me.</p><p>It was--so in any event, it was a big ask from Chamath because Chamath had never supported Republicans before. Obviously, I've been a crazy right-winger from way back, but Chamath had only supported Democrats, and he said he was in, and he decided to co-host it with me. And so based on that, I told him, "Okay, we're in.</p><p>We can do this." And then it turns out that more and more people wanted to come because we showed some conviction. So then we had $8 million committed, then $10 million committed. Then we ended up raising $12 million that night. - $13, I thought. - $13, and then $13.</p><p>Well, we got another million on top of it, so we ended up raising $13 million that night, so yeah. But it wouldn't have happened unless he decided to co-host it with me, so thank you, Chamath. All right, political losers, who do we got? I mean, I know this is a tough one, too.</p><p>I've already said this, so this is going to be repetitive, but it's the thing that disappointed me the most personally. I think the biggest political loser was Barack Obama. It's the same thing where there were so many of us that literally would have stood in line for hours to just shake his hand.</p><p>I guess I just revered the idea of who he was, and then I just saw a person that was reduced to honestly not telling the truth and doing it repeatedly and repeatedly, and it just lost a tremendous amount of cachet that I had for him and the sensation that I had of who he was as a man.</p><p>Who do you got, Freeberg, biggest loser? It's been said. I just went with legacy media. So my biggest political loser was lawfare. I thought lawfare was the biggest loser, because not only did it not work, it backfired. It backfired. Which you predicted. Yeah, exactly. You remember, they started the lawfare right when the Republican primary started, and I think Donald Trump would have won it anyway, but once they started these sham trials, they tried to bankrupt him.</p><p>They went after his kids. They tried to imprison him. Republican support shot through the roof, and he won the primary easily, and then they did the same thing in the general, and it activated and sort of radicalized a lot of people, including myself, because it was so un-American to try and imprison your political opponent.</p><p>So I think it massively backfired, and, of course, it wasn't just against Trump. It was also against Elon, too. Well, where did that get him? They turned Elon from someone who identified formally as a Democrat or an independent to someone who became a Republican. So it was not only-- not only did it not work, it basically had the exact opposite effect of what they intended.</p><p>Yeah, I picked Biden and the Democratic machine as my biggest loser for obvious reasons, and as we talked about on the pod, gosh, it was so obvious that they were covering up Biden's cognitive decline, and we're all sadly going to be in decline at some point in our lives, and that should be something where that person is supported and not abused in the way he was abused.</p><p>I felt it was elder abuse. We make that as a joke. And then not running a speed primary, and that's when, for me, a left-leaning moderate, I felt like I can't support this if you don't actually have a primary process, and I think they destroyed the party, and it just has to be rebuilt from the bottom up.</p><p>It was a disaster, and I'm super disappointed, like many people, in their thuggy and criminal-type behavior. I felt it was really low ethics, and I'm not happy about it. Okay, let's go political surprises. Political surprises. Anybody have a surprise? Chamath, you look like you got one ready to go.</p><p>My political surprise is J.D. Vance. I don't think, if this works out properly, there will be a Republican Party the way that you normally knew it. I think it is a MAGA party, and I think that J.D. Vance has the potential to become the standard-bearer past Trump, so that baton pass, I think, has the best potential.</p><p>And what I'll tell you about him as a person is this is a guy, if you have a chance, he will be here a lot, I suspect, especially because of David. Meet the man, understand where he's coming from. This is an incredible human being. I really do mean that, folks.</p><p>And I'm like a skeptical kind of-- generally, I'm not super effusive about people. You're thoughtful about who you would become friends with. He's an incredible human being. You got a surprise for us, Friedberg? What was your surprise this political season, 2024? I listened to the episode of Pod Save America last week where the Democratic leadership that ran the Harris campaign kind of gave their breakdown on what happened.</p><p>And what struck me the most about the conversation and the way they talked about everything was everything was about some demographic heuristic. Black males should do this. White college-educated females should do that. Everything was broken down to this, like, you are defined by whatever label we put on you and we expect that voting bloc, and we analyze you as a voting bloc, as a group, and how you all move together.</p><p>And all of that shit broke down. What happened in this election cycle was a lot of people voted as independently-minded people in a way that I think broke their brains. They didn't understand how and why people were starting to think on their own. And so I don't think anyone anticipated that going into this year.</p><p>It's certainly closely coupled with the rise of independent media, but individuals taking choice for not just being categorized and labeled and bucketed and told how to vote and what to think and what to do. People stood up and said, "I'm going to have my own thoughts on stuff." And suddenly all of the models broke.</p><p>That was the biggest surprise, and I thought it was like a big sea change, at least in the United States. - I think it's a really great point you're making. One great thing that could come out of this is the return to judging people by their character, their performance, their actions, as opposed to identity politics, which is a true dead end in our society.</p><p>I think it's really well said, Freeberg. Did you have a political surprise this year, Sax? - Yeah, I would say building on what you guys said, my biggest political surprise was that even in deep blue cities like San Francisco, the voters rejected the woke left in favor of more moderate alternatives.</p><p>So here in San Francisco, we got Daniel Lurie as mayor. He was elected. Dean Preston and Aaron Peskin were defeated. We have a moderate majority on the Board of Supervisors. In Oakland, the leftist mayor and DA got recalled. In L.A. County, we beat George Gascogne, who was the Soros DA.</p><p>Statewide, Prop 36 passed. This is the proposition to make crime illegal again. And so even in a deep blue state like California, you're seeing a return to sanity. - You know, I had a surprise. I was gonna say "podcasts," but when I thought about it, it was obvious to us, and I think a lot of people, that podcasts were gonna play a big role.</p><p>And it's clear podcasts played a big role, but I want to specifically shout out Friedberg and our podcast for bringing up the topic two or three years ago of the budget deficit and our out-of-control spending. And you harped on this, Friedberg. And, you know, I thought the election would be a referendum on Trump's behavior in the past.</p><p>I thought it would be a referendum on abortion and a woman's right to choose, and I'm not saying these aren't important issues. But now it's turned out that efficiency of our government and our fiscal responsibility and what we pass on to our children is now the most important issue.</p><p>I want to pause for a second. - Hallelujah. - Yeah, and I think it's a big round of applause for Friedberg because I just want to pause for a second of how unpopular that topic was. We said ourselves on the pod, there is no way that any politician will ever take this up because it's too toxic to talk about cutting spending, you'll never get elected, et cetera.</p><p>And now we're sitting here, and I think because of you harping on it, us talking about it, Elon caring about it, Vivek, who came on the pod, and he really got passionate about it, now we have Doge. And one of the greatest things that could happen in this administration, and I would be very proud, you know, of your contribution and the pod's contribution to this, is if we can just control our spending so we do not mortgage our children's future disastrously.</p><p>And this is the most important thing over the next year or two. If you don't like Trump and you didn't vote for him, you can support Doge, you can support Elon, you can support having a balanced budget and us controlling spending. It is an issue for all Americans, truly.</p><p>All right, this is a hot start. We got a hot start. Pass me one of those awards there. - Here you go. - Here we go. - All right, J. Cal's gonna invite our first guest tonight. Look at this. - Wow. - This is some serious man love. - That's me and Chamath.</p><p>- Should we clean up the naughty and nice list, by the way, off the-- - It's an ergonomic representation of me and Chamath hugging it out. - It's not easy to give a hug like that when you're on the spectrum, is it, Sax? - Not easy. - But you got through it.</p><p>So, it's a strength for him. Tonight, I'm very proud to give the award for setting the most money on fire in pursuit of a failed campaign to the one, the only, Aaron Levy, friend of the pod from Box. Welcome, Aaron Levy. ♪ ♪ - This is a very, very special-- - Wow, okay.</p><p>- Yeah. ♪ ♪ - Okay, I have no idea why I said yes to this. So, also, what the hell is this thing? I think this is the closest I'll ever get to speaking at the Republican National Convention, so thank you. Good to be here. I have a couple notes.</p><p>So, first of all, why didn't Mark Cuban or Vinod Khosla accept this? Why is this me? I don't understand what happened here. - Vinod doesn't have a sense of humor. - Okay, okay, so... All right, so yes, we did waste a little bit of money on this campaign, but it went to the Vegas sphere.</p><p>So did you see the sphere and how well that was-- the campaign used that money? So I decided to do a little bit of a post-mortem, so we called the campaign and talked to Kamala just to, you know, understand afterwards, you know, what the reaction was. Her response stood out to me, actually, pretty profoundly, so I actually wrote it down.</p><p>I wanted to make sure I got it kind of word for word. She said, and I quote, "I'm in the arena trying stuff. "Some will work, some won't, "but always learning." And, you know, I actually felt like that was a really good and profound way to think about the campaign.</p><p>So I left a lot better after hearing that. So now I do want to congratulate David Sachs. Obviously on his new role in the administration. Pretty incredible. The PayPal mafia takeover of the government is now complete, so good work on that. You know, I was getting worried, actually. So they told me about this, actually, like three or four days ago.</p><p>Changed the whole plan, obviously, midway. Nothing about what is going on right now was the plan. But I had to kind of say a couple lines about each person, and so David I was getting worried about because I didn't-- you know, sort of, I've been worried for David because I didn't know what he would do given Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Like, what else is David going to talk about? So, you know, I've known David's views on the war in Ukraine, but I actually didn't know that it was so serious that you become a czar. I mean, that's pretty impressive. Now, what's cool about David's new role, leading the Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, you can kind of think about him as, like, the IT guy of the government now.</p><p>So if you have any issues with the DMV website, he is your guy. And you also have the benefit of being the crypto czar, so I think if you could just let us know at some point in the conversation, what do you think the price target is on the Hoctua coin?</p><p>Like, where are we headed with this? Now, David works in the government, which means we have an inside track for some of the besties. Which I think will be pretty helpful for various positions in the Cabinet. And I know there's already a pick for this one, but if a position happens to open up for Transportation Secretary, maybe you could let them know that Jason was the first investor in Uber.</p><p>And I feel like that would make him an expert in this topic. Third or fourth, I think, actually. I was just going off of Wikipedia. I changed it today in anticipation. Now, unfortunately, Jason's probably disqualified for the Cabinet, because somehow he's actually even more woke than me. This guy loves masks more than Anthony Fauci.</p><p>He once tweeted-- and I actually want to be very clear about this. This was in October of 2021. He once tweeted, "Not to be a narc, but half the folks are not wearing masks at the Staples Center right now."  Hashtag super spreader. I added the hashtag, sorry. Okay, and speaking of COVID, we're going to bring it home now.</p><p>Friedberg, I know this situation must be very difficult for you with RFK Jr. coming on board. Everyone knows about preppers building out bunkers in case of disaster, right? Everybody talks about these kind of preppers. Friedberg's bunker looks a little bit different than everybody else's right now. Usually you want to stock up on ammo, cans of beans, et cetera.</p><p>For Friedberg, it's obviously quinoa, but--  He has one of every vaccine, tons of pesticides, and a lifetime supply of fluoride packed away. So we're getting ready for anything that could come next in this government. Anyway, in all seriousness, thanks for this incredible honor, whatever this thing is. I'm extremely optimistic for the path ahead in America.</p><p>We have a lot we can get done. So excited for that. Let's do it. Thank you. Have a seat. Join us. Give it up, everybody, for Aaron Levy. Well done. Come join us. All right. Aaron's going to hang out and do the next couple of awards with us. I just want to say that Aaron is my favorite white dude for Harris.</p><p>All right. The official line is beta male for Harris. That was--you got that wrong. I'll let Mark Cuban know he's number two. You know, I just realized I was the Series B investor in both of your companies. Wow. You know, it's incredible that David Sachs blew off the typical ceiling that you have being a B2B SaaS founder.</p><p>So this means we have something we can now strive for. So this is incredible. All right. We're going to do another set of awards here. Let's get this back on track. But actually, can we be--it was pretty cool, though, that the literal upcoming president of America mentioned Yammer in a tweet.</p><p>I mean, that is actually pretty cool. That was pretty great. I was surprised you didn't get a genie mentioned in there. It's a deep pull. Let's go over to our next set of awards. This first one is Best CEO, Not Named Elon Musk. So this is our yearly award for the Best CEO, Not Named Elon Musk.</p><p>Who do you got, Freeberg? Jensen. Jensen, an obvious one. I mean, everyone knows the numbers. What else is there to say? Okay. That guy has been compounding. And the crazy thing about compounding is if you zoom out at the end, everything looks pretty slow and flat and steady for a while until the end.</p><p>And he's built so many advantages into that business, and it's finally paying off. The macro was right, technology advantage, everything. It's just extraordinary patience, diligence, execution. Okay, Best CEO, Not Named Elon Musk. What do you got, Shamak? Dave Ricks, the CEO of Eli Lilly. Okay. Managed to build a billion-dollar company and is just ripping.</p><p>Ripping. Seems unstoppable. Sax, who's your Best CEO, Not Named Elon Musk? Well, I mean, Freeberg's right. If you look at the Mag 7, Jensen had the best performance. But since that one was taken, the number two actually was Mark Zuckerberg. You know, he's-- 5X? Hold on. He's been sneaky creeping up there.</p><p>I mean, if you look at Facebook's performance or Meta's performance over the last two years, it's up 500%. So it has done surprisingly well. And I will give him credit for back in August, he wrote a letter basically apologizing for the censorship that Meta had done exposing the government's role and the FBI's role in the whole Hunter Biden cover-up, which he did not have to do at that point in time.</p><p>It was not clear yet that Trump was going to win the election. So I think he deserves a little bit of credit for basically-- A little bit? --for wanting to do the right thing on free speech. But in all honesty, how long did you make him wait to meet with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week?</p><p>How long was the wait? Did you put an extra hour on the wait? Okay. Did you have a best CEO not named Elon Musk, Aaron Levy? I'm actually going to steal saxes. Zuck, for a very different kind of reason, but I think Zuck is our counterpressure on the price of AI right now.</p><p>And I think that he has a way of monetizing AI that is-- I mean, Google kind of has a similar thing, but they have a more existential challenge that I think they're actually doing relatively well kind of dealing with. And Zuck, just to improve ads, can give away AI for the world and keep everybody on their toes in terms of driving down the price.</p><p>So I think that's good for all of us. All right. Well done. I also had Jensen, for obvious reasons. Let's go with best investor. The NVIDIA crowd here is great. Just sponsor the show next year, guys. You could be in the VIP. You can afford it. I don't know why you guys are in Section Z.</p><p>Unbelievable. Maybe they're frugal. I guess Jensen's checking those expense accounts. Who do you got as your best investor, Friedberg? I just gave the best investor to the best public trade of the year, which was Druckenmiller, when he shorted treasuries. Told everyone inflation is not under control yet. We still have a ways to go.</p><p>No one was listening. He shorted treasuries. We don't know what the actual ins and outs were, but he has an incredible ability to be so very prescient, very public, very, like, direct when he has big bets and be right. Even if it is just a trade, I don't know what net returns are, etc.</p><p>But, man, that guy, when he talks, you got to listen. Chamath, who's the best investor of 2024 in your mind, besides yourself? I was going to say me, but-- We know. I'd give it to Michael Saylor. I think that-- Whoa! Bitcoin Max is in the back. I think he's found this incredible-- He's an investor.</p><p>I mean, he's the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, so he's not really involved in the day-to-day. He's really running their Bitcoin position, and he's created this massively levered, long Bitcoin play. He's borrowing money at essentially zero. His returns are bananas right now. What could go wrong? Sax, who is your best investor?</p><p>I had Druckenmiller as well for a similar reason, which is it wasn't just the Treasury bet. It's the fact that he's been warning for years that the U.S. fiscal situation is unsustainable. And in a way, he's like the investor version of Doge. He's basically saying, "If we don't fix this, we're going to have a huge, huge problem." Aaron, do you have a best investor for 2024 you can share?</p><p>I think the solo GP kind of cohort, but Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, they're quietly building probably one of the most powerful AI portfolios that we're going to see kind of play out. So they were first in line in this wave, and I think they're on top of it.</p><p>Okay, obviously an LP in the firm. And so I'm going to go with Peter. I'm just taking a guess, an educated one. Best investor for me was Peter Thiel, but on two tracks. Obviously, Peter's been in some of the great companies through Founders Fund, including SpaceX. But he also picked Trump, he also picked Vance, and he also picked Sachs.</p><p>So I think it's undeniable that Peter Thiel is just a great picker, hands down, one of the greatest investors, whether it's in people, politics, or businesses. So I give it to Peter Thiel. Let's do our best new product, best new product of 2024. Aaron, I'm going to start with you this time.</p><p>What's the best new product that you launched at Box? We do, but I'll exclude ourselves from this. But I think the wave of voice AI I'm most compelled by right now as sort of the 2024-- you can see the semblance of actually a new paradigm for mobile. We've kind of had the same thing on mobile for 20 years.</p><p>And so the ability to actually, in a high-quality way, talk to your phone, have it do something, I think you're starting to see signs. The latest version of Gemini is just incredibly powerful. Perplexity has very good work here. Chat GPT, advanced voice mode. So I think you're going to start to see this shape kind of computing in the next couple of years.</p><p>Sachs, any new products this year that captured your imagination? Yeah, I think this is the year that self-driving finally broke through. Obviously, Tesla's got full self-driving, but also this Waymo One app, people are going wild over it. I think this is the year that self-driving broke through, and I think next year it's going to get bigger and bigger.</p><p>Chamath, best new product this year? I'll pick the 2024 King's Cashmere collection from Loro Piana. That was my number two. Exceptional, like a baby's foreskin. Okay, I think-- I just got a message that Loro Piana made a big drop-off at your house. Okay, unbelievable. I would just like to say the best new product of the year is anything Tom Ford made, so I'd like to pander as well.</p><p>What do you got, Freeberg? I was with Aaron. I think advanced voice AI is a game-changing new UX. It's going to change computing, and it's weird. When you start using it, you can have a dialogue, learn something you never thought you could learn, and just ask questions and engage like you're speaking to your own personal tutor.</p><p>It's incredible. Very interestingly, we have two people talking about voice AI, and Sax, I was with you. I think this is the year that self-driving is actually manifesting across nine different companies. The companies in China, there are six or seven of them actually active, as well as obviously Waymo and FSD 12.X has been really a major upgrade, so I went with self-driving.</p><p>That's our amazing cohort. Let's give it up for Mr. Aaron Levy. Thanks, all. Thank you. Here's your chart. We had this great moment of hourly earnings growth going up, so how much people make on average. You're probably wondering why I look so bored. I mean, honestly, I want these dipshits to stop blabbering on, pass me the ball, and get the f*ck out of the way.</p><p>The wine is delicious, by the way. If only we could do an episode my way. Hey, everybody, welcome to the All In Podcast. For the first time ever, I, Chamath, the dictator, am moderating. I've replaced the besties with a couple of special guests. We literally have three of the world's greatest minds and bodies on the show.</p><p>First up, let me welcome one of Silicon Valley's most legendary investors, Chamath. Thanks, Chamath. By the way, that is a beautiful sweater. Okay, but let's cut the sh*t and let's get right into the show, because honestly, this could be the best episode ever. You're right, Chamath. Let's start with markets today, because we also have one of the greatest public market prognosticators in the world.</p><p>What is going on with the economy, Chamath? Great question, Chamath. Well, look, I think the U.S. economy, honestly, is a tightly coiled spring. The future looks unbelievably bright. Or we're in a recession. My gosh, I couldn't have said it better myself. Okay, guys, let's get into Science Corner next.</p><p>We have another brilliant mind on the show, technically incredible, a scientific genius. Tell us what you've made, Chamath. Well, I'm really excited to share that my new company, Shmoshmallow, has come up with a new way to grow perfect grapes in any weather. So now every grape can produce a 1992 Chateau Latour.</p><p>What? That's incredible! Can I invest a billion dollars? Well, we're going to have to see about that, Chamath. Wow, guys, this truly is the best episode ever. Orgasmic! Wow! Wow. All right, we're going to move on. I would watch that show. We're going to welcome our second in-person award winner.</p><p>I would watch that show. I want to see that. Our second in-person award winner of the night, our award for second best Botes sister, please welcome Alex Botes. All right, friend of the pod. Can you guys hear me? Well, good, because I have some awards to give out as well.</p><p>Oh, no. Chamath, congratulations on the most likely to think of Elon when making love. Do you guys remember when Chamath was posting thirst traps on Twitter? Imagine being a billionaire so annoying that you still need a six-pack to get laid. Next up, please join me in saluting America's first czar, All Hail Sax.</p><p>Congratulations on no longer being the least successful of the PayPal mafia. Oh, that one stung. It's good to see J-Cal laughing. I'm surprised you showed your face tonight after Palmer Lucky annihilated you last summit. Congratulations on proving that ass-kissing can be a career. This year, you win most investments, least exits award.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you. Okay, guys, this next one is a little bit spicy. J-Cal gets pegged by the VC industrial complex, and each time he whimpers "Uber" as his safe word. And last but not least, David Friedberg, the human equivalent of Soylent. Oh! Ooh! Jamaad likes that. Friedberg definitely got bullied all his life, but lucky for him, being autistic is now trendy.</p><p>But, hey, I got to give credit where it's due. Friedberg, thank you for making the world a better place for Monsanto shareholders. Thank you very much, everyone. I'm Alex Bowden. Okay. Thank you, Alex Bowden. All right. Wow. Well, you know, let's do our congratulations. Alex, welcome back to the stage.</p><p>Thank you for having me. It's great to see you. Last time you were here, you beat three or four of us at the same time playing chess. Two of four. Two of four, and what? She had a push with one of you, a stomach? I blundered the queen, but I won on time.</p><p>Okay, you won on time. I don't really give it to myself. How much have you been thinking about your defeat by Saks over the last six months? Clearly a lot after that roast. Yes, it explains a lot. Not that you're competitive. You know, we have some amazing awards to give.</p><p>Let's go with our favorite media, favorite media of 2024. Did you have a favorite media pick, Saks? Well, it's got to be podcasts, and I don't just mean our own. Like, pretty much all I watch these days are just podcasts, you know, so I never watch any network TV anymore.</p><p>Do you have a specific one that comes to mind? Well, if-- It begins with a T. If I could only pick one that's not us, there's a podcast called The Duran that I like a lot on international affairs, so check that one out. Oh, okay, deep pull, deep pull.</p><p>Tucker's going to be brokenhearted. Chamath, favorite media, 2024. This is--the director is a friend of ours. His name is Francesco Carozzini. The show is called Super Sex on Netflix. It is about the life of the Italian porn star Rocco Soffredi. It's phenomenal. It builds, there's drama, it's about his life as a kid, it's his relationship with his mom, his relationship with his older brother.</p><p>It's really good. Super Sex on Netflix. Okay, so Chamath just picked Pornhub for his favorite media. Great, deep pull, so to speak. Freeberg? Dune 2. Come on, it was unbelievable. I did not think that Dune 2 could beat Dune. The black--I mean, you saw, you're a little-- Don't act like you're not a nerd on the cinema right now.</p><p>You can't do that. Dune 2 is pretty great. It's pretty amazing. You know, I wanted to come up with something a little bit more recent, so I went with Day of the Jackal. It's a new show based on the 1970s thriller. I just watched episode 8. Nat and I watched it before we came up.</p><p>Good. Great, episode 8. Have you seen episode 8? I watched episode 8. Yes, it's great. Awesome. Phenomenal. So just, you know, great pull. Alex, what do you got? Any favorite media for 2024? Hawk 2 Up, but listen up, not what she did with the meme coin, but I've never seen anybody ride her 15 seconds of stardom the way she was able to do, especially when it's so hard to become viral across all platforms nowadays.</p><p>She was like a top 10 podcast for a couple weeks, right? Yeah, I think she peaked at number three. Yeah, it is pretty incredible. Inside story, the week Hawk 2 Up happened, we were going to have her on the pod. Sax and I were like, "Yeah, great pull. We should do it." And guess who spiked it?</p><p>Not Shamov. We could have had Hawk 2 Up on the pod to talk about Ukraine, to talk about Kamala. I mean, the world needed to know her take. Let's--imagine right after that clip comes out, let's have a bunch of guys talk to her and be like, "Yeah, what do you think?" and not look like a bunch of creepers.</p><p>That would have been a terrible idea. I still stand by the strike. Your editorial instincts remain terrible. Sax, best startup of the year. I'm just going to use this to promote my own thing. Yes, of course. I go glue, I go glue. Glue, of course. Fantastic. Shamov, your best startup of the year.</p><p>I'm going to go with O'Halo. Oh, wait a second. I want grapes the size of my balls. I want strawberries--hold on. I want strawberries the size of women's boobs. I want potatoes the size of butt cheeks. It's going to be fabulous. The world's going to be incredible. But you have not--none of them-- No, no, no.</p><p>Kidding aside, I do think what Freeberg is doing is bananas. But true story, none of us have been able to wet our beaks in O'Halo yet. None of us except Founders Fund. No, he offers us a chance to invest every time a round is closed and a new valuation is set.</p><p>Unbelievable. With friends like this. Freeberg, would you like to commit at getting us all in? Well, now I've got to say 80/90 and glue. I mean, it's tied. But I will say we've obviously talked a lot about the thesis behind 80/90. I'm an investor; you're an investor. But I put Anderle as my winner because-- Yeah, friend of the pod, Palmer Lucky.</p><p>I will say just talking about the collapse of Boeing, the new administration, and the number of people that are around Anderle that are also now around the administration creating a merit-based system for defense spending to kind of upgrade systems and strategies in defense, it's inevitable. If you look at what China's doing, the U.S.</p><p>is going to have to respond accordingly. He's like another one of these crazy people which is like, how does he go from building a VR headset to-- Well, he also made this game system called Chromatic. I mean, he's incredible. The guy's a genius. But, I mean, the whole business is set up with just a great group of investors.</p><p>It's perfectly aligned. The macro is right. I just think that that's going to be the next Boeing. Yeah, great timing. It's of the moment. What do you got, Alex? Do you have a great favorite startup? I like Anthropic because I like Claude a lot. And also, I'm not going to say OpenAI because I don't know what they're going to do with all the rumors lately, but I do use ChatGPT even more.</p><p>Okay, well done. And I picked Athena, one of our great investments this year that has tripled revenue. I'm very proud of the team over there. Let's go with biggest flop. Do you have a biggest flop, Chamath, this year? Okay, this is going to be a controversial take. I think the biggest--I don't want to say it's a flop, but I think the biggest disappointment of this year, to me, was OpenAI.</p><p>I'll tell you why. I think they are the most at risk, mostly because of things that are out of their control. So, number one, I think the quality of these models have hit a wall, and it's the folks that own private information-- for example, what Elon owns through X-- that is going to make the game changer in the quality of the models.</p><p>Two, he's actually bought now not just the largest NVIDIA cluster, but he's promised to buy 900,000 more. Do you know what happens when you buy 100,000 and then promise to buy 900,000? Not only are you at the front of the line, you consume NVIDIA's attention. And what that means is it's going to be so hard for everybody else to get a hold of what they need to train.</p><p>I think it's a very tricky situation for those guys. Sax, you got a biggest flop for the year? Biggest flop? My biggest flop was the self-declared knucklehead, Tim Waltz, from Minnesota. Freeberg? Apple Vision Pro. Apple Vision Pro? Yeah, I think it's a great start. It feels like the Apple Newton.</p><p>It's definitely going to usher in kind of a new computing platform, but it's definitely not prime-time ready, as we saw with the sales. Alex, did you have a biggest flop for the year? The Netflix cover of the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight. It was their first-- Oh, yeah. Good call, good call.</p><p>That was a good one, yeah. I mean, they were into live sports, and they just couldn't keep up with the streaming capabilities, and then they got hit with a $50 million lawsuit. Do you think it was fake? Do I think it was fake? I don't think so. I think Mike Tyson actually needed the money, and that's probably why he fought.</p><p>But you think he tried fully, like he went-- I think he tried his best. Yeah. Doesn't your sister box? Doesn't your sister do boxing? My sister does box, yeah, but tonight she'll be DJing at the after party. She'll be kicking ass on the ones and the twos. Yeah. You know, Friedberg used to DJ in college.</p><p>I heard Friedberg used to rave, actually. Is that true? Yes. Friedberg used to drop the beat. Yes. My biggest-- It doesn't get old. I mean, what do I say? My biggest flop was Boeing's Starliner embarrassment. I mean, if you bring astronauts up to the space station, you're kind of obligated to get them back down.</p><p>That's true. Yeah. That's-- I can't think of anything worse than that. That's a great-- that's a great call, actually. Okay. Thank you, Alex, for joining us. Let's thank Alex Botez. Well done. Big round of applause for our friend of the pod, Alex Botez. And by the way-- Thank you.</p><p>All right, we have one more award to do. Two more awards. Two more awards. Here we go. The biggest sports story and the moment of the year. Biggest sports story, a little sports in here, and then the moment of the year. Chamath, do you have the biggest sports story of the year?</p><p>I think it's Brawny James playing with his dad, LeBron. I think it was an incredible moment, and I think LeBron deserved it for everything he's done for the NBA. All right, well done. What about you, Sax? Do you have a best sport? I know you're not physically active at all, but do you have a sports-- Well, I think the biggest sports story of the year was the Olympics, and really the memes that came out of the-- I didn't really watch the Olympics.</p><p>I just saw the memes. That's what I was in it for. And we had that trans last supper. There was that shooter from Turkey, and the pole vaulter. Pole vaulter, yeah. Remember the pole vaulter? Yeah, Chamath. He was moonlighting as the pole vaulter. That's happened to me a couple times.</p><p>That was what I remember. Pole vaulter was pretty depressing. Freiburg? I went with Australian hip-hop at the Olympics. Australian hip-hop at the Olympics. But I do think that that moment really kind of showed everyone how ridiculous things had gotten. And it was like, at least in certain circles, it felt very resident of a broader set of things that were happening.</p><p>And everyone was like, "How is this an Olympic sport? How is this happening?" And it made a lot of people start to question the sanity of a lot of the institutions around us and things that were going on. Yeah, and I too thought the biggest moment in sports was at the Olympics, and just gender in sports generally as a topic, which we're going to need to get through as a society, where we have not only transgender individuals but intersex folks.</p><p>We need to work this issue out in good faith and have, I think, a thoughtful dialogue about it, specifically with the boxing and some of the other sports. Let's go to our moment of the year. The moment of the year. I'll kick it off, Sax. I thought the moment of the year for me was not the assassination attempt at Trump, obviously, but his reaction to it.</p><p>When he got up and he pumped his fist and he said, "Fight, fight, fight," I think you got an idea of his character and that he wasn't going to give up. And thank God that he wasn't hit by that bullet. I know it was an inch. Yeah, 100%. I mean, that was mine too, 100%.</p><p>That was like the moment of the year, the photo of the year. That's the image we're always going to remember. Pretty iconic, yeah. What do you got for the moment of the year, Chamath? March 16th. It was a Saturday. It was the greatest sexual encounter of my life. I gave Nat an enormous internal "oh." All by myself.</p><p>Wait, wait. Okay, so wait, the greatest moment of the year was the sexual encounter that you had-- With my wife. With your wife. Really, you know, it's interesting. I think we all got the tsunami warning when that happened. It was pretty-- it shattered the whole Bay Area. Freeberg, would you like to also pick the 17 seconds of your latest sexual encounter?</p><p>It was the Trump assassination attempt. So we had consensus here of what the most iconic moment of the year was. When it happened, I was sitting outside having beer with a bunch of people. And I remember there was, like, 12 of us. And we looked around the table, and everyone was like, "He just won the election." That was it.</p><p>It was, like, in that moment, I knew-- It felt like that was it. So I think it defined the year. Okay, so that concludes all of the amazing awards we've given. That is. That's our awards. Do you want to do a-- I don't know, maybe end with a little Christmas card?</p><p>What you're grateful for, looking forward, hope for the New Year, and then we'll kind of-- Well, you know, it's always a good time at the end of the year to reflect on the pod, on the community, and what we all experienced this year. Obviously, a major eventful year. Looking into next year, maybe what we learned this year, having just great conversations on the pod and off the pod, in the group chat, at the summit.</p><p>Any reflections on the year that was, Shamath? And then maybe some hope for 2025. I'll just remind everybody that we are the sum of our family and our friends. This year, you moved away, which is really heartbreaking. One of our really great friends in the poker game has been struggling with a bunch of very serious health issues.</p><p>So it's just a reminder for me that, you know, it just goes by really fast. I feel really lucky to be around you guys. I feel really lucky that folks like you exist. Thank you for listening. I love all of you. Thank you. Saks, would you like to try to channel emotion as we wrap up the show and reflect on feelings that might have come up inside of that meat sack, yeah, over there?</p><p>Call him a meat sack? I mean, to be honest, I was starting to feel really annoyed with you, J. Cal, on the pod. I wasn't sure how much longer I could put up with it, to be perfectly frank. But, you know, tonight, you kind of remind me why it's fun to do this.</p><p>Oh, thank you. And so, yeah, I'm very happy to be here tonight and be part of this. Well, yeah, reflecting on it, thank you. I, too, am reminded how absolutely insufferable it is to talk about Ukraine every week. But that I love you and spending time with you, all three of you, and debating this and learning together and growing as men and maybe trying to help and give back.</p><p>You know, there's so many positive things that come out of a good faith discussion. And, you know, we argue, we fight, we debate, but we always come together every week and we start it all over again. And we are cantankerous and we're perfectionists and we really try to make this a great product and we really care about the audience.</p><p>And it's just so wonderful that we didn't quit. I remember we had that conversation in the beginning and Chamath was saying, like, you know, "How does this become successful?" And I said, "It becomes successful if we just show up every week. If we just show up every week, it's going to work and it's going to be great." And, you know, here we are going into year five and I'm just so happy that we didn't quit.</p><p>And that we kept going forward. And I hope that we can all do this in 30 or 40 years in diapers, in a nursing home somewhere in Italy. I hope we do this for the rest of our lives because it's been such an incredible joy. And, man, I just love the fact that y'all come out and stop us at airports or take a selfie and tell us what you think of the show.</p><p>Friedberg, any thoughts on the year that was and the pod and, you know, this incredible moment of sacks? Many times when I was going to quit this show and I think how much I really don't like J. Kell. That's the theme and the reflections. And then sometimes I'll sit in my bath, I'll have my feet up, and I'll think to myself, "Man, I love J.</p><p>Kell." And for all the challenges that each of us have, I'm very grateful for the moment of being here with you guys. It's made a huge impact on my life that I never thought would be the case. Thank you. I also think we're in an amazing moment. The United States, certain people in the United States are really blessed and do really well.</p><p>There's a lot of challenges and a lot of things that need to be fixed and a lot of people that struggle a lot. And outside the United States, there's a lot more people that struggle a lot. And I'm really hopeful that-- I really do believe that technology drives prosperity and that technology and kind of the ability for technology to kind of transform lives around the world can help everyone.</p><p>And I'm very hopeful because I have not been hopeful in this way in a long time. And I think that over the next couple of years, there will be an amazing kind of evolution that'll be unleashed in prosperity that will really make a big impact. So I'm super helpful, super happy, and super excited.</p><p>Yeah, that's a great note, great note. Thank you to the amazing band tonight. Very well done. Big round of applause for the band and the production team. That's it. Well done. Let's get some founder mode. Come on. Yeah, let's get some founder mode. Happy holidays! Happy holidays, everybody! We'll see you at the party!</p><p>you you</p></div></div></body></html>
