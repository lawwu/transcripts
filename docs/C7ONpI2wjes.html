And it's steaming in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and of itself. So it's the most energy efficient way of cooking. I think the data will start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">come out that it's probably again, if you cook for two hours, it's probably not right for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">microwave, right? But for cooking, like, say, blanching some broccoli or something like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">why would I take four liters of water take 12 minutes to bring that to a boil,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">steam or boil my broccoli when I could do that in five minutes in a microwave, it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">more energy efficient.

So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">theoretically, because you can make delicious things with no fats whatsoever. Basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's really good for anything that doesn't need to be crispy, right?

That's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">dumbest thing I've ever heard.

And you can and you can put it in an oven, you know, so it's like, so this morning, I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">made I had a package of Korean wheat noodles, fresh noodles. I had a package of like one and a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">half pounds of frozen chicken thighs. I had some leftover shiitake mushrooms, I had a couple cloves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of garlic. We're leaving town on Friday. So I just want to use all the stuff we have in the house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And now that I'm at the office a lot more the studio, I'm cooking all my meals ahead of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my wife, whoever's at home, they can still have a freshly cooked meal, they're just reheating it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">usually in any day. So I took a large deep any day, I took out the chicken thighs, and I put it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in them, I covered it in any day and I microwaved it for about seven and a half minutes. I took out a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">pair of scissors, and it's still raw in the center, right, this block of frozen chicken thighs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I just cut it up. Again, seems insane. Taking scissors, you know, kitchen shears,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm cutting into little bits. The main reason why is as a home cook, I don't want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">wash more dishes than I need to. I'm always worried about cross contamination with poultry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not like I want to use chicken, put it on. So if I take the chicken raw, put it on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">cutting board, I have now chicken all over my my hands, I'm going to cut it. So I have to wash the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">knife, I have to wash the cutting board, I have to wash my hands multiple times, if you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to do it correctly. And now if I just do it in the any day, I don't even have to wash my hands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because I've never touched chicken, I put the lid on, cook it for about seven and a half minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's thawed out, but the center is still going to be raw. I'm going to I could cook it all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">way, but there's no need. And so I'm taking frozen chicken. Usually, if I have to defrost it, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at least a day. But you know, how else are you going to defrost it, you have to like just leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it out. So I've done that a seven and a half minutes defrosted. Now I've chopped it up in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">bits. I've taken the garlic and I've taken the shiitake mushrooms, I've added some, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">momo soy sauce, some dark soy sauce, some agave, some neutral oil, and I'm just sauteing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">added some scallions. And as that's cooking, I added the my chopped chicken and all the juices</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that accumulated and pretty much saute that for like a minute. And then I add the noodles that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">cooked, you know, reseason and I'm ready to go. Put it back into any day and they're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reheat that for lunch. So again, is it pretty? Absolutely not. But I'm not like cooking for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">an audience other than my family. The final product looks delicious, tastes delicious, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ONpI2wjes&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it was a roundabout way of getting there, but it was extremely quick.
