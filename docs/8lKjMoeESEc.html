And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">is what appears to max out muscle protein synthesis. 0.2 to 0.5 grams per pound. 0.2 to 0.25.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">0.25.

The answer to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is so weird, Andrew, honestly. Really? Why does it have to be so weird? It's freaking weird and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it's complicated. That's because, okay. So if we go all the way back to 2003, 2004, and then we walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">forward 20 years. So John Ivy and Robert Portman put out this book called Nutrient Timing, and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">focused on this narrow post-exercise window of opportunity, they called it. So the, the anabolic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">window. And the concept was you needed to consume protein and quickly digesting carbs. So a fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">digesting protein, lightning fast, highly glycemic, highly insulinic carb source together within, within 30</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to 60 minutes post-exercise in order to maximize the anabolic response and maximize recovery and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">maximize your muscle gain. So that was their hypothesis. This was all based on subjects who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">were training after an overnight fast. And so what happens when you consume a meal pre-exercise or at any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">point, let's say, a regular old mixed meal, medium size, the anabolic slash anti-catabolic effect of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that meal is going to last anywhere from three to six hours, depending on the size of the meal. So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you're somebody whose goal it is, above all the other goals, is to gain muscle at the quickest rate possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you're almost never going to train fasted. You're going to have a pre-exercise meal at some point, at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple hours pre-exercise. And so when you're training, you actually still have these substrates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in circulation through the exercise bout. And oftentimes, like if somebody has a meal like an hour</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-exercise, they're still absorbing that pre-exercise meal post-exercise. So we looked at this whole post-exercise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">period as something that just doesn't necessarily have any external validity. It doesn't have relevance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to real world training conditions where people are not training fasted. And so what we did was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we did a couple of things. First, we wrote a narrative review criticizing the post-exercise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">anabolic window. And this was in 2013. We kind of pissed off all the researchers who did the seminal work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">in that area. I'm sensing a theme here. It's teasing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we actually, we did a meta-analysis of the existing literature, looking at the anabolic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">window thing. And for the listeners, a meta-analysis is a study of the studies. You collect all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">studies on a given question, and then you kind of see, you look at effect sizes, and you sort of see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">where the evidence leans, whether there's a significant or meaningful effect or not. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we did this meta-analysis and we collected studies that compared a protein timing condition where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">protein was timed within an hour, either pre or post-exercise. And then the control group of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">study would have to have protein, a minimum of two hours of nutrient neglect on both sides of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">training bound. So we collected all the studies that compared these conditions. And we had a brilliant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">stats guy, James Krieger. He ran the regression analysis. And essentially, we found that as long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">as total daily protein was about 1.66, 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight, so about 0.7 grams per pound,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as long as total daily protein was at that or more, then the timing relative to the training bout</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't make a difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This is important for people to hear, because what this translates to in my ears is a very simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">takeaway, which is that you don't need to obsess about the post-training anabolic window,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if you're eating prior to training because you have nutrients circulating.

The reason why there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">a weird and complex answer where this is like a single resistance training bout causes this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, you know, this interesting cascade of things where muscle protein synthesis will peak 24 hours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">after the resistance training bout.

So the anabolic window</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKjMoeESEc&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually not hours, but days.
