I paint Gen Z as a generation that's been damaged, that's going to be less than they would have been. They're less ambitious, they're less successful, they're less happy, they're less competent. I've given a version of this talk in middle schools, in high schools, in universities.</p><p>They always ask at the end of it, "What do you think? Did I get your generation wrong?" Maybe one time, someone said, "I think you got this wrong." The other, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of times, they say, "Yep, that's basically right." Now, maybe some of them are too shy to speak up, but my point is, young kids, like 9, 10, they desperately want phone, TikTok, everything.</p><p>But by the time they're in late high school, or certainly college, the overwhelming view I find among Gen Z is, "Wow, did this mess us up. Not that I'm going to quit because I don't want to be alone, but man, did this mess us up." And that's why when you ask them, "Do you wish social media was never invented?" Most of them say, "Yes, I wish it was never invented." That's why this is so different from any previous tech panic, is that the kids themselves see the problem.</p></div></div></body></html>
