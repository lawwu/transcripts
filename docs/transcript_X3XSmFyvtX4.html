What are your friends asking you for help with? What are the things that you're spending your quality time doing?</p><p>What are those things and can you monetize them? I've literally tried to monetize everything I love in this life. And while that might sound like really creepy or cheesy, it works for me. I think it's like, what are the things that you enjoy? What are the things that people consider you an unofficial expert in?</p><p>And what are the businesses or side hustles that you would want to spend all day, Saturday and Sunday doing? Once you start to think about that, you might come closer to an idea. The other thing to think about that I love to do is start tracking problems that you have every single day.</p><p>What are the mini problems you have from the second you wake up till the time you go to sleep? Businesses are created because of problems need to be solved. And if you start monitoring and figuring out what the common problems you or your friends have, you might find yourself a really cool untapped business idea.</p></div></div></body></html>
