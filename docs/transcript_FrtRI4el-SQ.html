For all of our banking, I think my favorite picks are Brex and Mercury. For our amazing third member of our team, we worked with Oceans, which is a staffing agency, and that's how we found Possany, who is the most incredible.</p><p>Started out as an assistant, but has now grown into so much more, pretty much a chief of staff, making sure everything's running. Big shout out to Oceans. If you want to explore delegation and hiring an assistant, check out the delegation guide. For taxes, you know, I mentioned Gelt for personal, we use them for business as well.</p><p>We use QuickBooks Forever, which I hated, and we finally just switched to an awesome new bookkeeping software called Kik, kik.co. We do a lot of our payment processing and invoicing on Stripe. We send all of our emails through ConvertKit. We run all of our email addresses on Google Apps.</p><p>We run the whole podcast, and I actually run most of my life in Notion. Probably deserve to be mentioned outside of the business section.</p></div></div></body></html>
