Why do Catholics pray to Mary?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, there are really two parts to the story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the first part starts very well, that from the very earliest days, the Church and its theologians have taken Paul's vision in Romans 5 of the two men, Adam and Christ, who determine the destiny of all people to be a very strong, dominant image in salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two men, Adam and Christ, and we all depend on one of them for our salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In Adam, we all fell. In Christ, those who are united to him are saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that became such a strong feature in the theology of the early Church that people began to think, what's Eve's place in this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't just Adam who fell, it was Eve who fell as well. So they began to see a man and a woman are the origin of our damnation, and to see a nice tidiness as there's a first Adam and a last Adam, according to Paul in 1 Corinthians 15.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So some theologians started to play with the idea there was a first Eve and a last Eve who'd be Mary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this began to develop very, very slowly into the idea that somehow Mary might be a co-partner in the work of salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Pope John Paul II, he was a believer in Mary as co-redemptrix, a redeemer alongside Christ, which of course goes directly against what you read in Acts 4.12, that there is one name under heaven by which all men may be saved, Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that was a theological trajectory. It didn't do an awful lot popularly for praying to Mary until something else happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So from the year 500 to 1500 or so, there was for various reasons a tragic decline in the knowledge of God. The gospel became increasingly cloistered, knowledge of it became restricted to monasteries, people weren't being well taught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as the knowledge of God declined, so Christ receded into heaven. People felt they simply couldn't approach him, they didn't know of him as a saviour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that being the case, if you can't approach Christ as a compassionate and faithful high priest who will intercede for us, we need mediators between us and Christ himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the thought grew, well, if I can't approach Christ, I'll approach his mum who'll put in a good word for me to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so people would begin to pray to Mary who would pray to Christ who'd intercede with the Father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This actually started getting even stronger as Mary herself started acquiring this very exalted position as the Queen of Heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so people thought I should pray to her mother to put in a good word with her who put in a good word with Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the cult of St Anne began, Anne being the mother of Mary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you read the story of Martin Luther, you see this time when he's a young man, a law student, and he's knocked to the ground by a lightning bolt, the exclamation that comes out of his mouth is "St Anne, help me, I'll become a monk."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Luther had never up to that age dared pray to God himself. He would only pray to saints, mediators between us and Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other thing I think we see with Luther is because Luther felt he couldn't love God, indeed, Luther said, "I hated the righteous God who condemned sinners."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luther, you have to place your heart and your affection somewhere on someone who appears lovely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And since Christ didn't appear lovely, what Luther said he and his fellow monks did is they placed their affections elsewhere on Mary and on the saints because Mary, this mother figure, seemed to have a compassion that Jesus didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that I think explains why if you talk, say, to an Italian Roman Catholic today, you'll often get a strong sense of how much it's not just that Mary is an important figure for them, but they love her, that there's a real warmth of affection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that, again, betrays that view that Christ is not a compassionate and faithful high priest, therefore you need someone who will do that job for him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Hebrews 4, 14 to 16 would be the theological response you would give to someone who is praying to Mary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's absolutely right because if I was simply to be disrespectful towards Mary, that's not going to be a productive way forward. But to say, "All the compassion and the redemption that you're looking for in Mary, a better is found in Christ. I'm not taking away anything from you. I'm offering you a better gospel, a truer, more gracious God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, amen.

We're all seeking joy. Every one of us are seeking joy. We're driven by the pursuit of it. So where is true, abiding, eternal joy to be found? I'll ask Dr. Reeves that very question tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUiUN-rBqFM&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm your host Tony Reinke.
