And this is a great card. It's one of my favorites. We hold two of them right now. It has a higher annual fee at $550, but I think it makes up for it every year. You get 14X on Hilton, 7X on flights, rental cars, and restaurants, and 3X on everything else.</p><p>A huge signup bonus. It's never actually been higher of 175,000 points on 6K spend in six months. You get free Hilton Diamond status, which gets you access to executive lounges, daily food and beverage, or continental breakfast. You get $200 resort credit every six months. So we're actually timing our stay for the end of June and the beginning of July.</p><p>So we're gonna actually get that $400 credit all in one stay. You get an annual free night certificate. Then you get another free night certificate at $30,000 spend. And then another free night certificate at $60,000 spend. Now keep in mind, it's only Hilton Resorts, so it's not every hotel.</p><p>So I love the Hilton Aspire card. They're top tier of status. So I think the Hilton Aspire card's an S tier card. It's one of my favorite cards. I don't think we'll ever not have this card.</p></div></div></body></html>
