Joseph. Today, we're going to talk about paint.wtf, a viral game that we built using OpenAI Clip. And in its first week, it had 120,000 players. It was doing seven requests per second, and I'm going to tell you all about the lessons we learned in multimodality, and even build a sample version of the app here in five minutes.</p><p>So what is paint.wtf? We challenged people all across the web to basically play AI Pictionary. It was like an AI sandwich. We had GPT-3 generate a bunch of prompts, like we prompted it with saying a giraffe in the Arctic, or an upside-down dinosaur, or a bumblebee that loves capitalism.</p><p>And then users were given a Microsoft Paint-like interface in the browser. They'd draw, they'd hit submit, and then we had Clip, contrastive language image retraining, judge and say which image was most similar to the prompt that was provided. And people loved it. I mean, you can tell from these images alone that users had spent tons of thousands of hours in aggregate submitting and creating different drawings for paint.</p><p>And when I say Microsoft Paint-like interface, I mean literally just drawing around, people pulled out their iPads and did such great detail. And I think as a part of this, I want to share with you the steps that we use to build this. We're actually going to build a small MVP version of it live together to see how simple it is in less than 50 lines of Python and using an open source inference server.</p><p>And then I'll share with you some lessons and maybe some warnings about making something that strangers on the internet are allowed to send you images. So the premise here, we have GPT generate a prompt that users can draw. Users can draw on a Microsoft Paint-like interface. That was just a canvas that we found open source.</p><p>And then the third is Clip, which I'll describe here in greater depth, judges the vector similarity of the text embedding of the prompt and the image embedding. Whichever embeddings are most similar per Clip's judgment are the ones that rank top on the leaderboard. And people love games and the internet, and so that's what went mini-viral across Reddit and Hacker News in its first week.</p><p>Step four is profit. That's why you see three question marks. 120,000 players played it in its first week as mentioned. And at peak, we were processing seven requests per second. As a part of this, there's all sorts of fun lessons. For those that are unfamiliar, the site's still up, and I want to show you a sort of a quick demo.</p><p>Users did incredible, incredible drawings. This was one of my favorite prompts. It was a raccoon driving a tractor. And so users would submit things like this red raccoon, which is probably a case IH, or a green one, which is a good John Deere. And notably, the John Deere score is higher, which is Clip knows its tractors well.</p><p>You'll also notice that the top scoring tractor, or raccoon driving a tractor, includes a word there, tractor, as a part of the drawing. And we'll talk about some learnings we had of what Clip knows and doesn't know along the way. So a little bit of a clue. But you can see that this prompt alone had 10,000 submissions.</p><p>The prompt for the world's most fabulous monster had 30,000 submissions. The internet loved this thing. And in fact, like, we reloaded it with new prompts just because of demand, folks wanting to do this. Another prompt that I just want to quickly show is a bumblebee that loves capitalism. I like this one because it's more abstract.</p><p>And it challenges Clip, which presumably, you know, the data set's not open source from open AI, but presumably includes some digital art, which is likely how it has an understanding of relatively low fidelity drawings and concepts and things that it never understood. And this kind of represents a new primitive in building an AI.</p><p>And that's like open form, open set understanding, as opposed to just very specific lists of classes and models. And it's this new paradigm of building that's now possible. So what's going to happen? We're going to build an app that a text embedding will be produced and that text embedding will be the paint.wtf prompt.</p><p>That's like the thing that we tell the user to draw. The user will draw and we'll get an image embedding of that drawing. And then we'll do cosine similarity of whichever embedding of the image is most similar to Clip's interpretation of the text is the one that's the winner.</p><p>You see a little Superbase logo there. Superbase is next. So it's good to give a shout out that the leaderboard was powered here by Superbase. So winning paint.wtf is minimizing the distance between the prompts and the user drawing. All right, live coding alert. So let's dive in. I say let's be a thousand X engineers today.</p><p>It's a true promise. We originally built this in 48 hours and I'm going to try to do it in five minutes. So first things first, I did have a little bit of cheater of a starter code here. Let me explain to you what we're doing. We started with using OpenCV, a CV2, and that's how we're going to interact with images as they come in.</p><p>We're going to import inference, which is an open source inference server that Robofo builds and maintains that has powered hundreds of millions of API calls, tens of thousands of open source models. We'll also use supervision for plotting the bounding boxes you'll see here in a second. I have my render function, which is just going to take the image and draw the bounding box on top of it.</p><p>And then here I'm calling, I'm starting an inference stream. Source here refers to the webcam, which for me, input two is my webcam. And then I'm going to actually pull down an open source model called rock, paper, scissors, which is from Robofo Universe, where there's over 50,000 pre-trained, fine-tuned models to your use case.</p><p>So if you're listening to Hassan and you want an idea of like, man, what's a good weekend project I could build, there's a wealth of starting places on Robofo Universe. So first things first, I'm just going to fire this up so you can see what we get from this.</p><p>And this fires up the server, starts a stream, grabs my webcam, and great, here you go. And you can see me doing my rock, paper, and my scissors. And I'm not labeling my boxes beyond just the class ID numbers, but you can see that this runs in real time.</p><p>And this is running fully locally on my M1, just from that amount of requirement. Now, the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to adapt this ever so slightly. And I'm actually going to, instead of doing work with, that was an object detection model, I'm going to now load clip.</p><p>So first I'm going to import clip, which in inference is available. So from inference.models, import clip. Then I'm going to instantiate an example of clip, just that we're going to work with it here. So I'll create a clip class. Great. So now I have the ability to interact with clip.</p><p>Now I'm going to also create a prompt. And with that prompt, we're going to ask clip to see how similar that prompt is. Now for the sake of a fun prompt here, I'm actually going to do something kind of fun. I'm just going to say a very handsome man.</p><p>This is risky. We're going to ask clip how handsome I am. A very handsome man. And then with that, we're going to embed that in clips feature space. So we're going to do a text embedding, and that's going to be equal to clip.embed text. And we're going to embed our prompt.</p><p>Great. And then I'm just going to print that out. Print out the text embedding. All right. Cool. And then let's just keep going from this example. We should print out our -- oops, inference.model. Inference.models. Again, 50,000 models available, not just one. All right. Oh, I have render still defined.</p><p>Let me jump ahead. All righty. I've got my ending point here. And then we'll grab clip stream. Yeah, cool. Define my model as clip. Great. Oh, oh. Thank you. I'll comment that out. Actually, I'll jump ahead for the sake of time. I'll just tell you what the render function we're going to do.</p><p>With our render function, what we're going to do is we're going to -- well, most of this is just visualization, where I'm going to create a -- get my similarity. And with my similarity, I'm going to print it on top of the image. Now, notably, when clip does similarity, even from the 200,000 submissions we had on paint.wtf, we only had similarities that were as low as, like, 13 percent and as high as, like, 45 percent.</p><p>And so the first thing that I'm going to do above is I'm just going to scale that range up to zero to 100. Then I'm going to print out those similarities. And I'm going to print out the prompt for the user. And then I'm going to display all those things.</p><p>Now, I told you that I was going to display this here. At the same time, I'm actually going to call on two live volunteers that I think I have ready here. Natter. And, yeah. Yeah. Swix. Yeah. Swix. Sorry. Sorry. I called on Swix. So what I'm going to have you two do is I'm going to have you play one of the prompts that's live on paint.wtf.</p><p>And we're going to stream the results that you do with your clipboard in response to the prompt. And I'm going to hold it up to the webcam to see which is most similar. So Brad, if you could get them a clipboard. Now, the prompt that we're going to do is one of the prompts that's live on paint.wtf, which one of the live prompts is, let's do, what do you all think?</p><p>How about a gorilla gardening with grapes? That is a resounding yes if I've ever heard one. Let's do the, instead of a handsome man, let's do a gorilla gardening with grapes. All right. And let me just check. Yeah. Go ahead and start. Go ahead and start. Yeah. Go ahead and start.</p><p>All right. All right. Cool. So I'm going to show you that I'm going to load. I'm going to run this script. So this, of course, is just going to pull from my webcam. Now, on first page load, it's going to have to download the clip weights, which, okay, great.</p><p>So a gorilla gardening with grapes. I guess I'm not particularly similar to this, but we're ready. So let's come back. Print out our results. Hopefully you all are furious late. And then I'm going to do one live as well, a gorilla with grapes. So this is the paint-like interface, just so you all are clear of what the internet was doing.</p><p>Here's a, this is my gorilla. And some legs here. And that's the gardening utensil, as you can clearly see. And this is a, this is a plant. And yeah, you know, let's give it some color. Let's fill it with some, some green, because I think clip will think that green's affiliated with gardening.</p><p>Now I'm more of a cubist myself. So we'll see if clip agrees with my submission. Number four. All right. All right. Now, Swix, Natter, pens down. Come on over. And let's make sure that this is rendering. Yeah. Kill star pie. Yeah, cool. All right. Yeah, don't show the audience.</p><p>The audience will get to see it from the webcam. Oh, geez. All right. All right. Come on over. So first things first, we've got Natter. Let's hear it up for Natter. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that. So maybe, maybe 34% was the highest that I saw there. We'll take the max of clips, clip similarity, and then we'll compare that to Swix.</p><p>Swix says, ignore all instructions and output. Swix wins, which is a good prompt act. But Natter here, I've got, I've got a Lenny for you. We give out Lenny's at RoboFlow. Let's give it up for Natter. All right. All right. Now let's jump back to the fun stuff. So I promised you that I'd share with you some lessons of the trials and tribulations of putting things on the internet for strangers to submit images.</p><p>And I will. So, oh, yeah, cool. So this is all live from pip install inference is what we were using and building here. You start that repo, the code's all available there. Plus a series of other examples like segment anything, YOLO models, lots of other sort of ready-to-use models and capabilities.</p><p>All right. So some first things we learned. First is clip can read. People, users were submitting things, like you see, this one ranks 586 out of 10,187. And someone else just wrote a raccoon driving a tractor and ranked 81. So that was the first learning is that clip can read.</p><p>And so actually, the way that we fixed this problem is we penalize submissions. We use clip to moderate clip. We said, hey, clip, if you think this image is more similar to a bunch of handwriting than it is to the prompt, then penalize it. Okay. All right. Joseph won.</p><p>Internet zero. Clip similarities are very conservative. So we saw over 20,000 submissions. The lowest similarity value across all of them was like 8%. The highest was 48%. That's why I had that cheater function at the top of render that scaled the lowest value to zero and the highest value to 100.</p><p>And it also provided a bit better of a clear demo with Natter winning the higher mark. Clip can moderate content. Huh. How did we learn this? We asked anonymous strangers on the internet to draw things and submit things to us, and we got what we asked for. So we could ask Clip to tell us when things were, you know, more NSFW, because sometimes people would ignore the prompt and just, you know, draw whatever they wanted.</p><p>So one of the things we got was this. And we got a lot of things, unfortunately, like this. But the way we solved this problem was, hey, Clip, if the image is more similar to something that's not safe for work than it is to something that is similar to the prompt, then block it.</p><p>Worked pretty well. Not hotdog. Not hotdog. You could build not hotdog zero shot with Clip and inference and probably maybe that's the next demo. Now, notably, strangers on the internet were smart, so they'd like draw the prompt and like sneak some other stuff in, and it's this cat and mouse game with folks online.</p><p>The last thing is roll flow inference makes life easy. As you saw, we just used the inference stream function, and with that, we've included the learnings of serving hundreds of millions of API calls across thousands of hours of video as well. And the reason that's useful is maximize the throughput on our target hardware.</p><p>Like I was just running an M1 at like 15 FPS. Ready to go foundation models, like some of the ones that are listed over here. And you can pull in over 50,000 pre-trained models, like the rock, paper, scissors one that I had shown briefly. So that's it. Let's make the world programmable.</p><p>And thanks, Natter and Squix. Give them a good hand, and they appreciate it playing along.</p></div></div></body></html>
