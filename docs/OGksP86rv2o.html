a hard-to-crack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or security

target="_blank">00:01:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Hey, a good password, you know, should have this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then they started educating, like, "Well, we're going to give you some like information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about like why you want a

then the software and security operators finally just begin forcing people, like, "Your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">password has to obey all these rules or we're not going to accept it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

like, "We looked at your last passwords as well, and it can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=123"

security operation perspective, it's as if their mindset is, "Why are users resisting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">these rules?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Having more complicated passwords objectively makes these systems safer and harder to crack,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's bad if these systems get hacked into and cracked."</span></div><div

like these rules are somehow super onerous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.160</a></span> | <span

of an ask, and it's, like, important for passwords not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.040</a></span> |

I just don't know how to do it. This goes back to this question of like human-centric computing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can be like YouTube pro or something.

Look, muscles are vital</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">for movement and they play a key role in supporting the vascular system. The calves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">if you know this, Jesse, are often called the second heart.

By using a standing desk and incorporating movement accessories,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you are more likely to engage these muscles, promoting improved blood flow and overall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">health. This is where Uplift comes in. They have the Uplift desk, which I think is at the forefront</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of ergonomic solutions. These things are, they're really good technology. Now we know what a standing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">desk is. They go, if you haven't seen them in a while, they go up and down now, so you can adjust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">them and they are much more compact than they used to be. Somehow the lifting mechanisms are built into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the legs themselves. They also hold a lot of weight. That's another ad I see a lot. Uplift desk ads on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">YouTube and they're compelling. Like the one that I keep seeing is they have all this crap on the desk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and the desk can still raise up and down. See, I remembered that. So YouTube ads are effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But Uplift also has these other accessories that are also meant to promote sort of healthy movement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">ergonomics during your day.

I'm going to bring it here, Jesse, so you can see it. It's like a stool that wobbles. It won't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">fall over, but it wobbles. So like you can do some, like you have to do some core, not just like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">hold up your core, but it allows you to get movements.

There's two different possible things going on here. So one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">is approaching bigger projects using the David Allen approach, and this might be what you're suggesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's deal with that first. The David Allen approach to big projects is there are no big projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there are, but you don't work on big projects, is the way David Allen would say it. He would say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">all you can do is next actions, actions that take a few minutes to do that are clearly defined and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">know exactly how to execute them. So like in his approach, projects just get turned into next actions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that go on list with any other sorts of next actions, whether they're associated with products or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And work remains churning through next action list. And the fact that some of these next actions are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">supporting a bigger project is great, but you don't actually treat it different in the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a computer processor paradigm, right? Like a computer processor just executes instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">from a limited instruction set. It doesn't care or know that this particular instruction is part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">this big program that does this particular function. And this instructions from another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">program doing this type of function. It doesn't care. It just says, give me the next thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Increment register, done. Retrieve this value from memory, done. Right? So that's kind of the David Allen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">approach. If you can just be executing instructions that are very clear, you save yourself from having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to constantly be trying to think about what you need to do and why and what that means. And when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not negotiating with this with yourself all the time, work becomes less stressful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe in the David Allen approach, he calls them stakes in the ground. You have a list of projects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but you just sort of review that semi-regularly to say like, do I need to generate some more next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">actions from some of these projects to put over my next action list? And then otherwise you're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">executing those lists. I tend to think this approach doesn't work particularly well for most projects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">because a lot of big projects can't actually be decomposed into a sort of a sequence of isolated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">next actions that you can just interleave with other types of next actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of these types of projects, especially in sort of non-entry level knowledge or positions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">require a non-trivial sustained engagement, right?

And then once that cognitive context is loaded, really give some time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to try to grapple with the project, make progress on it, learn from that progress, adjust how you understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that when you're all done, sort of like update your notes and your understanding of what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It requires sustained attention. You can't just break down that project into two-minute steps. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">can interleave with changing the cat litter and calling the credit card company to renew your card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't tend to be a big believer in breaking down big projects into just small isolated things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that you treat like anything else.

This is why I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">recommend with multi-scale planning that you kind of have the open loops are there in your quarterly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">plan, which you review every week. And you can look at your week and say, when am I going to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">progress on these big projects this week? And you're moving things around and actually making time for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">them to make sure that time happens. And then on the daily schedule, you're making a time block plan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for your day. That's based first and foremost on what's on your calendar. So the time gets preserved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the way I like to think about big projects, right? It's like to be more concrete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a big project I'm working on, writing a chapter from a new book that doesn't break down in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">small next actions I put on a Trello board.

This is one of my big things this quarter. And in fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">what am I trying to get done this quarter?

And I'm looking at like, well, most of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">mornings I can start each day with writing.

So maybe I'm going to put together like an evening block. And then these are big blocks to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">sustained effort on a hard project. So in general, I'm not a big fan or a big believer in treating all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">work the same. It all gets knocked down into little projects.

What's this question? Can a Kanban system work across all departments in an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">organization without being overly complex? So for those who don't know, I mean, we talk about a lot on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">show, but the Kanban style system is where you have the columns and you have the cards in the column.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So like in Kanban, typically you have like a waiting to be done, working on and completed column.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're in a team, you might have a working on column for each team member.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can clearly see who's working on what and clearly how much they're working on. Kanban has clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2892" target="_blank">00:48:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">limits called WIPs or work in progress limits on how much cards can be in anyone's column. So it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">great workload management. I also like about Kanban systems that stuff that needs to be done is not all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">spread out on people's plates, but exists by default in a generic team level waiting to be done. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">only thing you're responsible for are the things that are on your column. This is important because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it's the things you're working on that generate administrative overhead. So sometimes people just say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, it's just convenient. If stuff comes in, I don't know who, let's just spread it out. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have to work on it all at once. But like, you know, hey, can you handle this? You can put it on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">your list. The problem with that approach is that once something is in your hands, it can generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">administrative overhead you have to deal with emails, meetings and cognitive cycles. So by keeping things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">by default off of any individual's hands, it can't generate administrative overhead. There's no one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you can email about it. It doesn't belong to anyone yet. There's no meetings to have about it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not being worked on yet. And so each individual is not only just working on a reasonable number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">things at the same time, they're dealing with a reasonable amount of overhead at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really like those systems. Agile methodology systems like Scrum use Kanban style boards. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">is why it's a little bit confusing. They also have boards with columns and cards representing things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that have to be done. There's more of a variety of what those boards are and different collections</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">or rules and terminology that surrounds them. So agile methodologies in Kanban have similar metaphors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2981" target="_blank">00:49:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for dealing with work, but they differ in the details. Can these apply to a lot of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">type of work? Yes. Can they apply like every team in a big organization uses things like this? Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Here are the two caveats. A, you want these to exist at the team scale. So six people? Sure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">this works fine. 60 people? You can't have one big board for that. It's going to be too many things and too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">many people. You can't easily coordinate with all the people. So usually these systems have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">a very efficient approach to coordination. Like let's all just like stand up and talk to each other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">for 10 minutes. Like, how's your card doing? What else do you need? What should we do next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So they need to exist at the team level, not at larger scales. Each team should have their own board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3026" target="_blank">00:50:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And the key thing is to resist. I think the thing that bogged down these approaches in software dev,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">where they really got big, is that we nerded out too much on them. Software types,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">we just nerded out too much. And we begin to obsess about the rules. And there's all these like rules</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and sub rules. And it became about the rules themselves because, you know, I'm a computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">scientist, so I can use the second person plural here. We love complicated rules. So we want our dev</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">system not just to be like, hey, here's a place to keep tasks and see who's working on what. We want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">rolling like 2D 10 to see if like I, my attack number is above your hit point level. And like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">goblin got killed by the wizard. Like we want to have all these rules and rules and all these complexities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3070" target="_blank">00:51:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can get pretty absurd, like agile and a software development environment. People have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">scrum masters and secondary scrum masters and dungeon master screens. And I don't know all the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it just becomes super complicated. And everyone gets obsessed with doing it just right because we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">all like slightly antisocial in these circles. If you're adopting these ideas outside of software,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">don't overburden it with rules. What matters is we have a centralized place to store what needs to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">done. So it doesn't by default, these things do not by default exist on individuals plates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We have clarity about who's working on what we have constraints about who's working on what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have a clear way to check in with everyone about what they're working on, what they need,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and when they're done, what they should work on next.

I want the granularity of what's on a task board. It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">have to be like a David Allen style next action, but something you could work on in a single session</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">is typically the way I like to think about that. So when there's projects you're working on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">they can exist in your larger scale plans. And then you can decide on the smaller scale plans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">what progress you want to make on that project that week or not.

So sometimes if it's a project, like I'm writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3280" target="_blank">00:54:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a grant application and it's on your quarterly plan, when you make your weekly plan, what that really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">means is I want to like block off 10 hours of writing this week and it'll be on my calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I get to those days, I'll work on the writing, then I'll be making progress on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not really a task you need to put on a task list somewhere. I mean, you could put right 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">hours and at the end of the week, take that off your task board, but that seems like a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">over the top or superfluous, right? On the other hand, a project might be kind of complicated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">like that it generates different types of tasks. So maybe it's organizing a conference and you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, this week I need to work on this. There's really like six or seven different things I need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">get done for this project this week that are all sort of tasky. There, I would put them on my task</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">list, perhaps. What I might do in that situation is create a temporary column for that project and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">then have those tasks under it. Or if I have like work on this week, I might label certain projects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3336" target="_blank">00:55:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">related to this project, like with that, just in caps, like the project name, and then have the task in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3341" target="_blank">00:55:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And there, when I'm working off my task list, I sort of see those there. Oftentimes though, if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">something that I know I want to make progress on, I might have put aside time for working on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">project. And so, you know, I'll know when I get to that time, oh, the details of what I should do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">right now are on my task list. So I really just think about the interaction between those task boards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and projects about whether I need help knowing or remembering what about that project I need to work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">on this week. And if the answer is yes, you can put them in task on that board. And if the answer is no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3370" target="_blank">00:56:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's just writing, it doesn't have to interact with your task board. But I would keep the cards on the task</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">board at the granularity of things you can do in a single session. It's why you need other stuff in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">your practice other than just a task board, right? That's why you need your like, this is what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">working on this quarter and it's deadlines and my strategy for getting this done. You need somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the, like in March, we really have to get out in front of this grant application,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but not until late March, should we really start ramping up this work on the website overhaul,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but let's wait till then to do it. Like you need that type of thinking in like some sort of quarterly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">plan or semester plan document. And then how that translated into actual work, again, just depends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3408" target="_blank">00:56:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">on do I need help remembering what it is specifically I need to do to work on this each week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, a lot of my project work just exists as projects. Like my task board is, it's more like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">one-off specific things, I would say, if I really looked at it. It's fine, by the way, I like that Derek had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">specific, he had some specific task boards for recurring obligations in his work to come up all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">time. And like the application process, you know, this or that, like, okay, I get this stuff all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3440" target="_blank">00:57:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, here's my dedicated board. I kind of have a system going with that. I think that's good. That's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3445" target="_blank">00:57:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. We also have a case study here. This is where people write in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about ways they've put the advice we talk on the show into action in their own life.

When her older son started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3502" target="_blank">00:58:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">school, she told her work that she was unable to work past 2:00 PM because she needed to pick up our son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3508" target="_blank">00:58:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Being the top earner, they created a new schedule for her to work seven to two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">doing op only. She not only gets to pick up her son every single day from school, but because she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGksP86rv2o&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is op only, she actually makes significantly more money.
