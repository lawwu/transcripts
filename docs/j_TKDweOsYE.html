class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes my job really exciting to wake up in the morning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and see what developers are going to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you're in this room, I don't need to tell you that AI is a big technological paradigm shift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">as Cloud, mobile, or social before it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think everyone here is already convinced of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is interesting to see just how quickly things are moving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because I think that it's a good reflection of how quickly things are about to move next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I realized that I gave a talk about a year ago where I was pulling up some stats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and looking at where we were at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, a year ago, about 44% of developers were using AI as a part of their day-to-day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to help them write code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And Gartner was predicting that by 2030, about 50% of knowledge workers would be using AI to augment their work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And these numbers seem really, really low now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, today, over 75% of knowledge workers use AI to augment their work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is already surpassing the 2030 estimates that were given.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And more than 76% of developers use AI as a part of their development process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that, honestly, from the time that this report was pulled to now, that number has grown even more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The other interesting thing was that about a year ago, when we were talking about workloads, we were primarily talking about workloads in AI that involve training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And we predicted then that workloads were going to shift towards inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, we've been seeing that unfold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we saw that with OpenAI's O1 model, which is shifting more and more from training to post-training and inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We saw a similar thing, actually, with DeepSeek, who optimized training so much that more and more energy is spent on the inference part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's talk about what's next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, after training and inference comes, I think, actual automation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know there's been a lot of talk about agents the past couple days, but this is the reason that this is so exciting, is that we have the opportunity to not just augment people's work, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You've been able, for some time now, to go somewhere like ChatGPT and ask it, like, "Hey, help me draft up an email."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's really, really powerful is to be able to go and say, "Hey, I have a campaign I want to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Grab me a full list of the customers that I talked to this week at the conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">then draft me up the email, then actually, I do want to review it before it goes to a customer, so do send it to me for approval, and then ping me when the customer responds."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, these are exactly the types of agentic workflows that I think we're going to see more and more, that are really going to unlock that next level of productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're already starting to see these agents out in the wild and really meaningfully impacting businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, some businesses are seeing 20% revenue increases already as a part of starting to adopt agents as a part of sales automation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Some businesses are seeing 90% faster response times to support when using AI agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And in general, people are seeing about 50% to 75% time savings when using agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, agents are going to be even more meaningful, but are already reshaping the way that we work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, but you want to build an agent, where do you start?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What all goes into building an agent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The way that I like to think about agents really comes down to these four components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first you have the client, you have the interface that the agent is going to be interacted through with a human, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you have the AI, the reasoning piece, the thinking part that's going to come up with the logic of what are we about to execute, what are we going to do next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the thinking part needs now, it's executive branch, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It needs a way to go and execute on the actions that it decided that it was going to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, so that's the workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then workflows also need access to tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's not just enough to be like, okay, I'm going to go and do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They need access to the tools to actually take the actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's run through a quick example of what would it look like, that CRM agent that I was just showing, if I were to go and build something that helped me contact people that I talked to, what would that look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=378"

connects over WebRTC, you then need a speech-to-text model to translate what you said back into text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Alternatively, we're all familiar with chat UIs, right, so you need somewhere to host that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, ideally, you're using some sort of gateway to do caching and to run your evals to make sure that, as you're iterating on the overall process, that things are getting better and better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you need to send that response to an LLM that's going to do the thinking part and come up with the rest of the plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">From there, you need a workflow agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's what's going to keep track of what actions have been executed and what actions need to take place next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, again, you need to connect to your tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be a web browser, it can be an API, it can be an internal service that you need to connect to, or it can be a vector database if you need to grab additional knowledge that that agent needs access to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes, you're also going to need a human in the loop to verify some of these actions that you're taking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how do you build an agent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually going to go backwards here and start with the tools part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And most recently, there's been a lot of talk about MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the amazing thing is that Anthropic introduced this new standard back in November.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the really interesting thing about it is that it really got people thinking about, okay, how do we expose APIs to LLMs in a way that allows us humans to talk to LLMs over natural language?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the real missed headlines of MCPs was actually that LLMs became really, really good at tool calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This wasn't so much the case a few years ago if you tried to play around with tool calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But now they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we have this new standard for how you can actually write out your code in a way that's going to be incredibly easy to consume by any MCP client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the, again, really cool thing about MCP is that it does respect a traditional client server architecture where you're able to have that conversation back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And importantly, have more than one client that connects to the MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, these are some of the core concepts that go into MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP servers generally have resources, prompts, tooling, and sampling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Resources can be anything from file contents and database records.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Prompts actually help you define how you want someone else to interact with your agent because you can actually prompt your agent probably better than anyone else can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">If there are any nuances about how your system works, you want to build that into it as much as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you want to give it access to the actual tooling, right, and connect those queries with the tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then last but not least, sampling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually think I haven't seen anyone using sampling in production yet in an MCP server was the interesting conclusion that I came to as I was preparing this talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea is to actually allow you to kind of use shorthand with your LLM and allow it to kind of complete some of the thinking behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but building MCP does come with some tricky parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the trickiest parts of that is, first of all, the transport protocol over SSC and WebSockets, the OAuth part, and the memory part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm going to share a cheat code with everyone here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, get ready.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to like flash it real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, you missed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I'm just kidding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Cloudflare has an SDK called Agents that you can install that will actually give you a lot of this functionality out of the box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we released Agents SDK a few months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, it has the same name as the one that OpenAI just released a few days ago as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But, and the two actually work, play with each other really, really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll tell you a little bit about what it does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can, so you can use Agents SDK, first of all, to run MCP servers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it comes with a class built-in called MCP Agents that allows you to host your remote MCP servers with OAuth, with transport, with HTTP streaming, all built-in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you're one of those people that never wants to touch OAuth again, this allows you to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The really cool thing is that it has state management built into it because Cloudflare has this primitive called durable objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, durable objects, the idea is basically, it's kind of like a serverless function, but with state attached directly to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you've ever wanted to write some code, but then save the state of it without ever having to set up a database or anything like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a really, really great way to do it and makes it really easy to build these MCP servers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes with real-time WebSocket communication, so that makes the whole chat interface thing really, really easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">React integration hooks, so you can build, you can integrate it into your front-end really easily, and basic chat capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's walk through what it would actually look like to deploy an MCP server on Cloudflare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first, I can define my MCP class that extends MCPAgent, which I was just talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And this MCP server is going to be kind of like a Goodreads server that's going to recommend different books to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're going to set an initial state that's empty, but then I can give it a tool that's called Add Genre.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I can start to specify my preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a big Patricia Highsmith fan, so I can say, you know, I really like thrillers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to, it's going to save it and persist it for future interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, when I then ask it for, I can then have a separate tool called Get Recommendations that's going to get book recommendations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can have, so we were talking about MCP prompts before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have a personalized prompt for recommending books to someone who likes the genres, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And has read the books that you've previously specified that you read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it's a really good way to get these personalized recommendations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And every time that you interact with this tool, it's going to persist the memory over every single time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the recommendations are going to keep getting better and better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And because this MCP server is standalone and can be interacted with through various, through various clients,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the memory is actually going to persist regardless of the tool that you're using to call into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, why is this great?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's amazing because traditionally you would have to separately set up a database, manage connections, handle scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There would be added latency in the setup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Versus with MCP agent, because the memory part is built into it, you don't have to do any of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to scale automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to run close to your AI agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't really need to think about infrastructure at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You just get all of that out of the box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You can actually, so we have a blog post up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You can go and deploy your first MCP server today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really, really easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There is literally a deploy to Cloudflare button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes less than a minute to get your initial MCP server up and running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's been really cool is working with some of the brands that we respect so, so much and seeing companies like Atlassian, Asana, Stripe, Intercom building their own MCP servers in this exact way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're actually going down a really, really well trodden path here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the tools part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's keep working backwards from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're giving our agents access to tools, but now we need a coordination component, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">A workflow that's going to maintain a state not through just that one tool interaction, but through the entire chain with perhaps a human in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So human in the loop workflows require you to have really long running tasks that sometimes need to talk to an LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be a reasoning LLM that takes several minutes to come up with a response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And similarly, if you're talking to a human in the loop, a human could take minutes, hours, days, months to respond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you need something that's going to be able to come back and resume its flow after that task is completed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You also still need to consider things like WebSocket servers, stay persistent, retries, horizontal scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">These things can get quite tricky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, let's walk through a real use case that we built out with a customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a company called Knock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They do notification management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And they needed to provision an agent that would do approval when you could request a new credit card, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, your boss needs to go and approve it through, you know, it can be an email, Slack, in-app notification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do we need to do in order to do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">First, we need to allow users to request a new card through a chat interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that here we're importing useAgent from the agent's React library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to create a new instance of chat that's going to have all of these things instantiated on our behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is all part of agent's SDK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we need to give it an ability to issue cards through this issue card action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But we need to wrap it in the require human input tool in order to delegate that piece to Knock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to make sure that the issue card tool is always, always requires the human input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we need to invite Knock to send our approval notifications and defer the tool call to issue the card until there is approval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a tool call to get a new card provision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But we want to stall that on the actual approval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that in here where we're going to route the messages to approve something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, once something is approved, we need to then route it back to the appropriate agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is going to automatically be handled by the durable object and instantly routed to the correct agent back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see in here that I'm going to find the user ID from the tool call for the calling user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm going to be able to look it up so I can get the agent by name by the user ID in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then if it's an existing agent, we're going to route it to the correct durable object and make sure that we're handling it with a correct webhook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We then need to resume the pause tool call, issue the card, and let the user know that the card was approved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So in here, if we received an approved status, then we can move on with the deferred tool execution that we defined earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then last but not least, we need to make sure the duplicate actions don't occur, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So if two things happen out of sync, we can't approve the card twice or we can't provision the card twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is where, again, that state management becomes really, really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're able to store all of this directly in the state here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see if, you know, if the card has been requested or processed already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if it's been approved, we're going to set the status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So when a new webhook comes in, we can't reapprove the same exact one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we talked about tools, we talked about workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, you need the reasoning piece of this and need to choose the right model to run this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually going to skip this part because there's an entire conference that's dedicated to this today of people that are going to cover this way better than I will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, Logan's talk this morning about everything that's happening with Gemini was really, really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a bunch of people talking about evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you still need a client in order to connect to your server, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this is the really beautiful thing about MCP is that once you built out your MCP server once, you can truly meet your users where they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And realistically, the nice thing is you actually don't have to build a UI yourself at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">If your users are developers, most likely they're already using cursor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now that cursor supports remote MCP servers, you just import your MCP server and have your clients be able to interact with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, Claude and ChatGPT, they both support remote MCPs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So your users, again, can start using your agents instantly directly through there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can also build your own app and your own MCP client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is where you can build really, really interesting agentic workflows when you do have more control over both the client and the server and connecting these two pieces together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only that, but your app doesn't actually have to be limited to just being a user interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also talk to your MCP client over voice, especially with some of the CloudFlare tools that we have built out that help translate WebRTC to WebSocket in a way that really makes it easy to build out these applications because the MCP client can easily understand those connections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, how do you build an agent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the four different pieces you need, your client, your AI, your workflows, your tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you want to get started and don't know where to start, I really, really highly recommend the agents SDK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll be able to get up and running in just a few minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_TKDweOsYE&t=1266"
