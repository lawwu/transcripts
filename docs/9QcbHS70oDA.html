years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd say the primary reason

target="_blank">00:27:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I see people that are young, they're looking at buying a home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're like, well, we have to live here 10 years to make buying a home a good deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to live in a pretty nice house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we need a place that when we have kids, we can fill it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this was our thinking when we first bought a house, we had no children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were like, well, if we're going to live here long enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">for this to be a financially good deal, we need a house that we can have kids in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need at least, let's call it three bedrooms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we didn't need three bedrooms for like five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So had we bought a place with three bedrooms versus rented,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">for renting, we would have just had a one bedroom for the next five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we might have upgraded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But for buying, because we knew we had to be there for so long,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we were like pre-buying space we didn't need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that would have been a very...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this problem of pre-buying space is something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, I want to buy my forever home.</span></div><div

rent a comparable home for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I do the math and I say, oh, well, I'm spending three grand a month now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you can't compare apples to apples unless you look at the same kind of house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But also I actually want to push back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes people say, well, do the rent versus buy with comparable properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say, well, if you're only going to rent a one bedroom for three years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you're going to switch to a two bedroom for three years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and then maybe a three bedroom in three more years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll compare that kind of whole picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">because you wouldn't actually have to rent the comparable three bedroom for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we ended up doing was we found a place, it was random.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.220</a></span> | <span

class="t">We saw this house and it had a separate entrance on the master bedroom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was on a separate floor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were like, what if we lock off that floor and we rent it out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So we basically bought a three bedroom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">but for five or six years, it was just a two bedroom.</span></div><div

room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were able to commit to, we're going to live in this place for 10 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.420</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:29:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But we were able to not pay the price for the space we thought we would need in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we ended up decorating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

| <span class="t">One of those ways is what you just described,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QcbHS70oDA&t=1806"
