all on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's great to be talking to you about the initiative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's a great start to get going with the podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Jonathan, why don't you tell us, how did this initiative get started?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I really am not the right person to be talking about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I was approached about, would I like a journalism award set up in my memory?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And my response was, absolutely not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The world has way too many journalism awards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure that it needs another one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I said, well, if we're going to do something, let's do something to help young people get started as investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And my initial idea, which seems simple to me, but didn't prove to be quite so simple, was that it would be great to take kids from disadvantaged families and get them started as investors by funding Roth IRAs with $1,000 on their behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I threw this out there and thought, well, seems like a good idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Should work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, you said you threw that out there, but who did you throw it out there to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my initial conversations were probably with Bill Bernstein, who's been involved with this, as is Mike Piper and Karen D'Amato.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned this, that Bill had one or two further conversations with me about it and said that there seemed to be some problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But essentially, I was cut out of the loop, which is a nice place to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">One of my goals in life is never to sit on a committee again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all this work was going on in the background, and I had absolutely nothing to do with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So perhaps Jason or Christine could talk a little bit more about what's been going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Christine or Jason, what happened after that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go in alphabetical order, Christine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember Jason and I kind of at the Morningstar Conference talking about next steps here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we, at the Bogle Center, the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy, it includes some of the people that Jonathan just mentioned on its board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So Mike Piper, Karen D'Amato, Bill Bernstein, Alan Roth, ex of our board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We have this 501c3 that's dedicated to help improving financial literacy and wellness in the community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And we thought that perhaps we were well-situated to help facilitate this because standing up a separate 501c3 seems like a pretty big project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we felt that our mission at the Bogle Center is enough aligned with Jonathan's vision that we were in a position to help, that we could serve as the repository for donations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the next step from there was really figuring out, well, who is our partner organization to help operationalize this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the Bogle Center is a fairly small operation, as you know, Rick, having been my predecessor as president.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were kind of casting about looking for different entities that do some version of what we wanted to do here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And really, that's where Jason picks up, because he came to us with an idea of a group that he had been familiar with that he had written about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Jason, maybe you want to talk about how J-PAL entered the picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll echo some of what Jonathan said with a couple of more details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he and I have been friends since early 1987.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of my goals was to spare him all the nitty gritty, all the agonizing back and forth, the this won't work and the that won't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And, oh, crap, we forgot about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And a large part of the process of overcoming obstacles was dealing with things like what paperwork is going to be required.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=434"

interest?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, am I exaggerating, Christine?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It was hundreds, hundreds, hundreds of hundreds of emails and numerous phone calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And quite early on, I realized that we needed reinforcements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">This was not a project that we could take on either individually or exclusively through the Bogle Center because it was too big and complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I thought of J-PAL, which is an organization that does experiments in behavioral economics with the goal of reducing wealth and income inequality around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Are they affiliated with any academic organization?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So J-PAL operates out of MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And its co-head is Esther Duflo, who won the Nobel Prize in economics for research that was largely driven through J-PAL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wrote about them for the Wall Street Journal about a decade ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe it was 2016.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was familiar with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought, what could be better than setting this program up as an experiment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what J-PAL specializes in is RCTs, randomized control testing, where you take two groups of people and you expose one to the experimental condition and the other is the control group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where it evolved and that brought in a whole new group of people, actually two groups, because this program will be at the ground level operated by a youth employment organization that is operated by the city of Boston.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's this group that is going to be the subject of this experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll describe what the experiment is in a minute here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But who chose that group?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Was that MIT?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first of all, because of the eligibility rules for a Roth IRA and the importance of being able to track the participants over time, they wanted it to be run through an organization that J-PAL has a longstanding relationship with because they've already put the data gathering infrastructure in place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we get into the administration of this study and initiative, let's describe exactly what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, what are we studying?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Christine?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the goal of this pilot program will be to get these young people investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the study will give them the funds and a little bit of direction about how and where to invest the money with a little bit of a nudge-nudge into a target date vehicle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then J-PAL will study what happens after that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Just so I understand, the study is about if you give these young people $1,000 and give them educational material, in this case, that might nudge them into a target date fund of some sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is to see what happens in the future if they build upon that or if they just take the money out of the account and spend it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And how that compares people who you did not give any money to, is that how it's supposed to work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I can jump in for a second, there's research from around the world, much of which has been done by people associated with J-PAL, showing that cash grants can be a motivation for future saving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't know whether this program will work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">These young people are under a lot of pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">They come from poor families and undereducated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't know how they're going to behave when they get $1,000 in an account that is created for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">In a Roth account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Will they immediately withdraw it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Will they leave it there and forget about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Will they leave it there and add to it as they start earning income of their own?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Which, of course, is what we're trying to see if we can incentivize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the purpose of the experiment, to figure out whether it will work, what works best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And with luck, the lessons that we acquire through this experiment will apply more broadly throughout society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can help motivate young people across the country and across the world to become long-term savers and investors, which is a pretty good way to honor Jonathan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me just jump in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing I want to clarify is that while this initial experiment is going to be based out of Boston, the notion is that this is not going to be Boston only.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The hope is that if it's successful, that it'll get rolled out into other cities around the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just for this initial summer program that will launch this summer, right, Jason?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a very good point, Jonathan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And as Christine said, this is a pilot program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's testing the initial feasibility, like, can this be done?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we need to tweak to make it more effective?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the problems with young people maybe who don't read well or who don't know the difference between a stock and a bond or who've never turned the term mutual fund or ETF?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's going to be a lot of trial and error initially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can tell you in my Wall Street Journal inbox, I have at least a dozen emails from readers in other cities saying, how can we find out more about this program?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we want to try it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And the real purpose of this experiment is to make that possible so that we can take what we learn in Boston and enable people in Minneapolis and Chicago and Los Angeles and San Antonio and the other places I've heard from to do it there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing we really liked about J-PAL and its approach was that they're constantly iterating on what's working, what's not working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we'll be able to look at this pilot program and see maybe incentives would help get people to add additional funds to the account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a matching of some sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's not one and done saying we have fixed this issue and we're going to go forward with it forevermore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's saying here's something we're trying and then we may try to improve it as we go along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that was a very agreeable approach to all of us because there are no clear-cut solutions to helping people emerge from poverty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The other great advantage of doing a project like this through an organization like J-PAL is, of course, being run by a team of academics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">One of their goals is to publish the findings as a research article in an academic journal, which will be, of course, widely circulated around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Similar organizations elsewhere will have that free intellectual property to build on and to try to create similar programs elsewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think about techniques like automatically defaulting employees into a target date fund that has become very popular in the United States or automatic rebalancing, all of those ideas originally came out of academic research and have been applied successfully in the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So we hope if this project takes hold that it'll have a similar effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's three parts to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That will get young people enrolled in this program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was not involved in the creation of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I'm learning as I go along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, someone will select the group of people who will get these $1,000 grants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And number two, they will, with some help, I assume, they will open up a Roth account and $1,000 will be contributed from the Bogle Center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct, Christine?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the contributions are coming in through the Bogle Center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Contributors have the opportunity to earmark their contributions to this initiative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the book also that was published, that money will also come into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that go through the Bogle Center too, the book revenue, which we'll get to later?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is that the revenues will come in through the Bogle Center and we will then contribute them out to the initiative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Bogle Center being a nonprofit, 501c3 organization, has the ability to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you are facilitating this through the Bogle Center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the second thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The account is open and it's funded with $1,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But the third thing that's happening is these people who are granted the $1,000 Roth are going to get educational material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And Christine, I understand that's also coming from the Bogle Center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That has been a collaborative effort, Rick, where the goal is to give the participants at point of purchase enough information to make a good decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But we don't want to overwhelm them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't want to put them through a whole curriculum, make them take a test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to give them enough information to make what we hope will be a good choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've crafted some materials about what is a target date fund with some basic detail on what investing in stocks entails, what investing in other safer assets might entail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the trick was to provide them with enough information, but we certainly didn't want to overload anyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've been compelled by some of the research at various institutions that have looked at financial education kind of at point of purchase, that if you can give people a little bit of information to make a good choice when taking out an auto loan or allocating a 401k for the first time, those can be very powerful interventions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Perhaps more so than putting someone through a long curriculum where they're learning things, but they're not in any position to put them to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the goal here, was just to give a little bit of information at point of purchase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, let me jump in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what the research has shown us is that if you do put somebody through a general personal finance curriculum, that the information that they get and the learnings they get degrade relatively quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And after maybe 18 months, they're as but ignorant as I was when I was 18.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you jump in when they're about to take out a mortgage or they're about to get a credit card or they're about to fund an IRA and the information is immediately, to use a word I hate, immediately actionable, then it can be super effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in this particular case, you know, these kids will be getting information right when they're making a decision and with any luck, it will prove super useful to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're selected to participate in the program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they are given help to open a Roth and then the money is going to come into their Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the same time, the Bogle Center is going to provide them with this educational package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that the way it works?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, the Bogle Center through J-PAL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, through J-PAL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">J-PAL will be doing this sort of hands-on work with the participants to give them the materials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this material available online for anybody to look at?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I have an 18-year-old grandchild, I used to say child, but now a grandchild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">18-year-old grandchild, I could also take the same information that these young people are getting and give it to my grandson?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We haven't thought about that, Rick, but that's not a bad idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Materials were written explicitly for this sort of point of purchase decision-making, but I think they could easily, we could readily put them online on the Bogle Center website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very good idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">This is very exciting, and different ways you could participate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If I wanted to give to this initiative, I could either make a donation to the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy for specifically this cause, and I could use my donor advice fund to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">John C.

the days when you could go out, wander out into Greenwich Village and get a lunch for under five bucks, which is our specialty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I've known Bill Bernstein

target="_blank">00:22:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the fact that this has been done under the auspices of the Bogle Center, I mean, that I love because I love Jack Bogle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought he was just, you

charismatic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And to have this project operating under the Bogle Center is really great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's just from my point of view, not that my medical condition is a dream come true, but in terms of this particular project, it really is a dream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, to work on it was a dream as well, Jonathan, to have communications daily with Bill and Jason and Karen and Alan and Mike was a ton of fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would also say from the Bogle Center's perspective, Andrew Bogle, Jack's son, is on our board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And when Andrew heard about this project that we were working on and the potential for the Bogle Center to be involved, his directive was go, go, go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He felt that it was very aligned with his dad's vision and he was utterly supportive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And we feel that that's sort of like the family support as well, which is which is a lovely thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Great ideas, everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for all the hard work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully we learn a lot from this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So getting to the book, Alan Roth wrote in the book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Jonathan has consistently reminded his readers that money is not an end in itself, but a means to achieve what truly matters, security, freedom, and the ability to nurture what we hold dear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">His columns are not about maximizing wealth at any cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They're about finding balance and aligning our financial decisions with our values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that really, I thought, encapsulates you, Jonathan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And in your book, The Best of Jonathan Clements, you selected what you believe are 62 of your best columns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was combined in this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So tell me about that process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So initially, I actually picked out, I think, 75 columns, and we ended up down at 62 because, as both Jason and Christine can attest, you know, one of the secrets to being a longtime columnist is repetition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Repetition without people noticing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So you just keep saying the same stuff and hope that nobody actually realizes that you said the same thing three months earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, as I went through the, you know, thousand-plus columns I wrote for the Wall Street Journal, there was a heck of a lot of repetition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was really just a question of narrowing it down to some distinct columns that covered different topic areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was where the, you know, we ended up at the 62.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing about being a columnist, and I think both Jason and Christine can also attest to this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is, you know, you don't want to be the typical Wall Street writer where, you know, what you're saying hinges on the stock of the day or, you know, the market movement of the month or whatever the hell it is, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you're doing that, you're doing a disservice to your readers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you need to do is somehow speak eternal truths while making it seem timely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is the trick to being a columnist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, in a sense, what Alan is talking about in what he wrote for the book is about, yeah, trying to figure out what it is that we can say of lasting value as columnists,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but packaged up in such a way that it has some immediate appeal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so with many of these columns, that was my goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I remember so many times going in to talk to my editor at the journal, and he's like, well, what's the news hook?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the news hook?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, do we really need to have a news hook?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Can't we just run a decent article?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in some cases with these columns, what I did is actually remove the news hook when we put them into the book because the news hook was not important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What was important was the meat of the pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm pleased with the way the book came out, though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I would also say, and I think, again, Jason and Christine will echo my thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when you go back and you look at the stuff that you wrote, you know, 20, 30 years ago, it's like, whoa, that was really not very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, you know, what I found when I did a lot of writing for Forbes is that the articles that you don't think are very good are actually the ones that are the best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the ones that resonate with people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I write an article and I'd say, well, that was just terrible, but I'm going to publish it anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And people rave about it, how great it was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I write something that's really insightful, really important to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody cares.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this does remind me of what I call Zweig's Law, which is, if I like it, you hate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you hate it, I like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, Jason and I have had this conversation, actually, that the amount of research you put into an article is inversely proportional to its popularity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you work really hard on a piece, it's going to be like crickets when it comes out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you whip it off in five minutes, people are going to love it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So you started out with 75 and whittled it down to 62.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So tell us about the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">What happened in this case was that I came up with the initial 75.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Bill Bernstein went through and put them into categories, and he wrote little intros for each of the chapters, as folks will see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, I went, took it, and I was like, eh, this sounds a little bit like this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's how we went from 75 to 62.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the greatest human impulse is to edit other people's work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I went through and revised Bill's categorization, and that's how we ended up with the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then along the way, you know, Jason, Bill, and Alan Roth all wrote pieces that appear in the book, either at the front or the back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And you ended up with 11 sections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you don't mind, we've got some time to spend on each section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we could all maybe throw in some input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So the very first section is basically categorized as talking with family about money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And this you put up right up front, how to talk with parents, children, so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in the end, you know, why do we manage money?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do we accumulate money?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we, you know, for most of us, you know, we have a core group of people we care about deeply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we want not only our own financial security, but we also want to make sure that they're okay financially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I say to people, either you're in the circle or you're not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're in the circle, I will do everything in my power to make sure that you are okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So family is not necessarily a blood relative, but it's whoever is in the circle and the people that you will go to the ends of the earth to make sure they're okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Jonathan, I have to say that this is one of my favorite sections of the book because it's so differentiated discussions of talking to your kids about money, trying to inculcate healthy financial decision making in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">When I looked at this section of the book, it was one of my favorites because I just don't see this discussion in a lot of other personal finance writing about how to talk to children, how to help develop them as savvy financial human beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the really happy part of this story is that your kids have generally taken what they learned to heart, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, things turned out here, which is a really nice sort of end cap to this piece of the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I treated my kids sort of as financial guinea pigs and I experimented with them in all kinds of different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Fortunately, all the manipulation doesn't seem to have left too many scars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, it's had a generally good output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, both my kids are quite financially responsible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think when I was on your podcast, Christine, I talked about how my son during his seven years getting his PhD, he was getting $30,000 a year as a stipend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And over the seven years, he managed to save $100,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's frugality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The only thing I worry about a little bit is that maybe they learned the frugality a little too well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.820</a></span> | <span

don't want to be so frugal that as Alan Roth always likes to talk about, you don't want to be the richest person in the graveyard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I would just add that the temptation for people who think about money and investing a lot is to think about the how.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.620</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, why are you doing this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a really important message that gets overlooked.</span></div><div

house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jonathan's view is your house eats your money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Tell us about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So over the course of my life, I've owned four houses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, all of them have eaten money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people do this creative accounting where they somehow turn their houses into fabulous investments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you sit there and you run the numbers on how much it costs to own a house,

tackles household capital allocation, which is the thing that we don't talk that much about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We sort of move straight to investment allocation and the decisions you're making around your investment portfolio.</span></div><div

investing in our portfolios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I

target="_blank">00:32:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was struck by how prescient some of the columns were about over-allocating to real estate, that they preceded the big real estate market meltdown,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">where Jonathan is cautioning about not going overboard on improving your home, on over-investing in properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was something that was quite striking, was just how prescient those conversations were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure there were that many people talking about over-allocating to real estate prior to the real estate crisis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.500</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I guess the only note I would add is that if you look at data from Robert Schiller, for example, the Yale University economist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see that the long-term real return after inflation, the long-term real return on residential real estate is zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the 17th century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the consistent finding is that your home is not a particularly good investment in a financial sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But I love the way Jonathan brings across the fact that this, like a lot of other investments, is not necessarily about the financial return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you get a psychic return from investing in your own home, even if you don't necessarily get a high financial return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">All great points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

investing, how the media tries to influence you on investing, the financial industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to sort of group all those together about investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jonathan, if you could summarize, you know, the main topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, within this is there's a list chapter, which has lists, columns that are lists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.760</a></span> | <span

sort of different themes within these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one is like the basics of investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I've done this column countless times, you know, 10 things you should know about investing, about how you're not going to beat the market and the importance of paying attention to costs and so on and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But another aspect of these pieces, and I think Jason could talk to this much more readily than I because it's really in his wheelhouse or other than mine, is in the late 1990s, behavioral finance really exploded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It hit the popular consciousness, and while Kahneman and Dversky had been looking at this stuff since the 1970s, suddenly all kinds of other academics were weighing in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Tons of research was coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And for me as a columnist, that research gave me extra legs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, look, if you're trying to figure out something to write every week and there's a new interesting piece of research, it's like, hooray, that's another one down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was really a golden era of behavioral finance research, late 1990s, early 2000s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that also played into a lot of those pieces that appeared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jason, of course, during this time, you came out with your book, Your Money and Your Brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Jonathan, as he often is, he's being overly modest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">He was really the pioneer in bringing attention to this field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">This research had been around for a while, and certain people in the investing world were aware of it, but it had never really gotten much attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jonathan really brought it to the fore and introduced the idea that, as I like to put it, it's not investments that make or lose money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And he really brought to the public consciousness the idea that you should look in the mirror as an investor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't just look out the window at all those stupid people down on the street, but look in the mirror and look at the dummy who's looking back at you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the sections on investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to say, from a personal standpoint, I learned so much about investing, but also talking to investors from Jonathan, from those columns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote about this on Morningstar.com, just how influential he was to me in terms of kind of shaping the direction I wanted to go in with my career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2255" target="_blank">00:37:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Did I want to be someone who was sort of adding to the confusion and the cacophony about investing, or did I want to be someone who was helping to clarify?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it seemed like with every column, Jonathan was there clarifying and helping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is a through line in all of these columns, is just helping with the advice about having a decent savings rate, having a sane asset allocation, having a plan that you can live with through a variety of market climates, that those things would put you on a firm financial footing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2291" target="_blank">00:38:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was also struck, as I read through the columns, just frankly, the courage in them, in that so many of the entities that Jonathan would criticize, the financial advice industry, certainly the asset management industry with its constant production of various products, of varying degrees of helpfulness to investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">He was very critical, and I found power in that, and it really helped, I think, give me courage to say some of the same things when I was eventually charged with helping investors in the same way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was at the Wall Street Journal through this period, the managing editor for, I think, pretty much the entire period was Paul Steiger, and really wonderful individual, super supportive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And even though I was saying stuff that people on Wall Street didn't necessarily like, Paul was always supportive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember one time a delegation from Merrill Lynch came in to complain about something I had written, and so we ended up in the big editorial conference room on the ninth floor, and, you know, sitting around, and they're whining about this and that, and they'd cooked up a bunch of numbers that contradicted a set of numbers that I had, and their numbers were just flat out wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we sat there, and they made their spiel, and I took it apart, and as we walked out of the conference room, Steiger leaned into me and whispered into my ear, they didn't lay a hand on you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the way it was, you know, so even though, you know, we were obviously taking their advertising dollars, it wasn't expected that we should, you know, kiss their feet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It was okay to be critical, which was wonderful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So coming back to the stuff about behavioral finance, as I went through my time at the journal, there were really sort of four sets of interesting research on what I would say is the human side of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">gave me sort of a few extra years as a columnist, and one was behavioral finance, then there was an area, again, Jason did much more on this than I did, but neuroeconomics, then there was the whole area of evolutionary psychology, which is very closely connected to neuroeconomics and how it influences our thinking, and then an area that became particularly close to my heart, and there's a chapter within the book devoted to some of the columns, on happiness research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And those four areas, happiness research, evolutionary psychology, neuroeconomics, and behavioral finance, to this day, remain great, fruitful areas for anybody who wants to write about human behavior, and particularly human financial behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess the only real trick here, and not much of a trick, because I could figure it out, was just to look at the research and say, you know, what does this mean for the average individual?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2474" target="_blank">00:41:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">How can I take the insight that some poor PhD has spent, you know, years looking into, and turning it into, you know, one or two nuggets that people can use in everyday life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the trick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I, as a reporter, as a columnist, I hated picking up the telephone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't like interviewing people, but I enjoyed reading the research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, instead of

right towards the end of my time at the Journal, so 2007, 2008, the concept I became super interested in was human capital and how human capital is really, you know, thing around which you can arrange your entire financial life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, human

health insurance, you need life insurance, you need disability insurance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, human capital, of all the concepts out there, when it comes to defining your financial life, is probably the most important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that's really where that section kicks off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This section is a great reminder to people that you can think about your human capital as resembling, maybe it resembles a stock, maybe it resembles a bond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If, for example, you're a tenured high school teacher and you're fairly young, your human capital is probably a lot like a bond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.380</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:44:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, because your human capital, which is a portion of your overall portfolio, is quite safe and secure, you can afford to take more risk with the financial part of your capital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, somebody whose human capital is like a bond can probably safely afford to invest quite a bit more in stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, somebody whose human capital is probably more like a stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2684" target="_blank">00:44:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">People who work in the medical field are generally, human capital is like a bond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2688" target="_blank">00:44:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, because it's not economically cyclical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.440</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas, maybe if you're in manufacturing or something, it's more like a stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that may have some effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And even in technology workers, a programmer or something, I mean, you may have cyclical earnings, ups and downs of the technology industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you're more like a stock than a bond.</span></div><div class="c"><span

capital and the potential to have consistency of human capital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2726"

target="_blank">00:45:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the components of the book that delve into retirement and finding enough, determining whether you've actually saved enough to retire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And quantifying enough, as Jonathan discusses in the book, is a very subjective question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Helping people determine whether they have saved enough and how much they can reasonably spend, how much they can give to their loved ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the columns on that topic, I think, are incredibly valuable and do stand the test of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'd like at this point to just put in a plug for Christine's book that came out last year, which I think is superb, absolutely superb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I interviewed Christine for How to Retire, the name of the book, in episode number 73.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What it speaks to, to me, is the complexity and difficulty and emotional trauma of giving up your human capital and moving into retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Retirement is hung out there as this sort of prize at the end of this four-decade journey of saving and investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2796" target="_blank">00:46:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But, in fact, when you retire, you not only lose a paycheck, you lose your identity, you lose social connections, you lose your emotional, intellectual, and physical stimulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it is a trauma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think it's appreciated enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2812" target="_blank">00:46:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you read some of the interviews that Christine does in that book, you really come to appreciate how difficult retirement is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not disappearing off into the sunset for 20 or 30 years of fun, fun, fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's quite different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2827" target="_blank">00:47:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, thanks for that, Jonathan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a badge of honor that you wrote the foreword for the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I so appreciate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And my soundbite on the book is just that this is not a math problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2839" target="_blank">00:47:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a message to the bogleheads who might be listening, who sometimes get a little lost in the spreadsheets, that there are many more dimensions to retirement planning than some sort of number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2851" target="_blank">00:47:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And Christine's book is so good that my four-month-old puppy ate the entire thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And after my puppy ate the entire book, I immediately went out and bought another copy and put it on the top shelf where it's safe as a reference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2870"

target="_blank">00:47:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The last part of Jonathan's book covers what is a rich life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Jonathan, you talk about this thing called a rich life and money and well-being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to describe, in your own words, here you are, right, your situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, what is a rich life to you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the book is the final column that I wrote for The Wall Street Journal in 2008 before I departed for Citigroup for six years or as Jason and my other friends from the journalism world would call to the dark side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that final column for The Wall Street Journal in 2008, I said that the rich life, the happy life sort of consists of three key components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one is, yes, you do want a sense of financial security.</span></div><div

over many decades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But two, you want social connections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to be

into retirement and say, I'm going to relax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.380</a></span> | <span

retirement and after two months of relaxing, you're bored out of your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you need a reason to get out of bed in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So here I am.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know how many more months I have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">My best guess, based on how my treatment is going and so on, is that I might have seven or eight more months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.940</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:49:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's better than I was initially promised.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was diagnosed 12 months ago, I was given 12 months to live.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And at this point, I'm still in okay shape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But for those who are curious, my treatment plan is failing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm trying to get on to a new treatment plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.760</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">But the cancer is continuing to spread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's spreading up and down my spine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's spreading in my brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've had frequent doses of radiation and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I need a new treatment plan if I'm going to make it any more than sort of seven or eight months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where I stand today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Nonetheless, despite all of that, despite the fact that I know that time is short, I do not get up every morning and binge watch Netflix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I get up every morning and think about what it is that I can do to have that sense of progress, that sense of striving, that sense that I'm doing something useful with my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't tell you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that, you know, it's better than crack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, not that I've ever tried crack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3038" target="_blank">00:50:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's better than crack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">To have that sense of purpose, you know, to come to the end of the day and say, yeah, I accomplished something, that's really valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And for anybody out there who's trying to have a richer life, I would encourage them to figure out what it is that they are passionate about, what will make their days fulfilling, and focus on those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the wonderful thing about being financially independent and having a healthy amount of savings is that you can devote your life to the things you care about most.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would encourage people to save and invest and manage their money with the goal of being able to lead the life that they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUi0MPKz-I&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Jonathan, that's a very
