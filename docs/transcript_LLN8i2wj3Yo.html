How did he do it without scandal? I mean, when you think about how the world is in our time, when everything has either a financial scandal or a sexual scandal attached to it, Moses didn't have scandals. He built the Whitestone Bridge, for example, which is a gigantic bridge connecting the Bronx to Queens.</p><p>It's beautiful. It was finished in the late 1930s on time and under budget, actually a little earlier. There's no such thing as that now. You're going to do a big public works project and you're going to do it on time? And also, he did it well. I think Robert Caro deserves a lot of credit for doing research on Moses, his childhood, his growing up.</p><p>I think his legacy will continue to evolve and I think slightly improve as Americans realize that it's hard to build public works, especially in dense urban environments, and he did it.</p></div></div></body></html>
