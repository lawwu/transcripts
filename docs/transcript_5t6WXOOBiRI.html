Yep, I think it's mostly for finding things that are lost at security. Once it's in the general airport lost and found, ClearScout can help you. If you leave something at a TSA checkpoint, they're very good at getting it back.</p><p>It implied that it would also work if I left something at the gate. Yeah, yeah. And they could go find it, but I've never used it. Sounds like you've used it? We've used it for clients before, and I'll say that once you get to the general airport lost and found, God be with you.</p><p>It's impossible getting things back. Even like things you might leave on an airplane that then get turned into the general airport lost and found. I mean, it happens. We've gotten jackets and iPads and laptops, but for some reason, it's like they kind of disappear once they hit airport lost and found.</p></div></div></body></html>
