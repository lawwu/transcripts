They're already maxing out their 401(k) in their twenties.

Why would you spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that much money for one single day in your life? It doesn't make any sense." The economists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">will say, "Why would you spend X thousands of dollars on a dress you're going to wear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">once and put it in your storage closet?

But looking back on my wedding, now that I'm far enough away from it, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">let's see, 2007, so we're getting close to...

My first category was books. I think I mentioned before, when I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">first came out of college, I knew next to nothing besides reading a few textbooks, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to play catch up.

I would go to the library, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I was a frugal guy, but all these books would be on back order that people would have already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">signed up for. I'd wait weeks or sometimes months for a book. Finally, I said, "Screw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this. I'm just going to buy the book." For me now, I bought a Kindle, and I never questioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">buying books.

If it looks interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to buy it.
