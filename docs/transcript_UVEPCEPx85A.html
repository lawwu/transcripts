And if you try to turn it around, you don't have Christianity anymore. I'm a Christian hedonist for theological reasons. I am after people's affections, their hearts, their emotions, their feelings, because all of our behaviors come from this. There may be a few behaviors that you do by dint of willpower against your passions, very few. 99% of what you do is out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks, and the arms move, and you live. Therefore, the number one issue in life is having new passions. As obedient children, that's what we want to be, children of God, as obedient children, we should not be formed. Don't be conformed to this world, be transformed. We should not be formed, conformed to passions that were rooted in ignorance. So we're spending five hours together trying to banish ignorance, increase knowledge, awaken passions, new conduct, Vancouver sees, and gives glory to God. That's 1 Peter. Just said it, we can all go home now. That was the summary. Hope, totally replacing all the passions that drive you into sin, according to ignorance, new passions, new hopes, new joy, inexpressible, overflowing, full of glory, producing holy in all your conduct. Since it is written, you should be holy, for I am holy. God does not come to you and say, OK, holiness is what I want from you. All right? And here's some things that are going to be holy. You don't sleep with her anymore until you're married. And you're not going to get drunk on the weekends. And you're just going to stop stealing. And you're not going to lie anymore. OK, let's get about it. That's just totally not Christianity. He comes to you and spends 12 verses saying, do you see the hope that you have? Do you see the inheritance? Do you see how it's imperishable and undefiled? Do you see how God is keeping you for it? Do you see how he is putting you through fire in order to make it precious so that you receive glory and praise and honor? Do you see that? Do you have knowledge now? If you do, you've got some new passions. And these old ones, these old ones right here, they're not going to govern you anymore. And therefore, your conduct will be holy. Holiness is three steps out. Knowledge, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, see the world as it really is. See eternity. See the value of the hope. Feel new passions. Do new conduct. That's Christianity.</p></div></div></body></html>
