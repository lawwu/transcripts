<span class="t">We take customer questions and figure out a way to answer those questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=89"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One, a list of questions that they want answered about a specific company or person

them to provide some guidance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a free-form text field that lets you describe, sort of like how you would describe to a high schooler,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how they should go about the actual research.</span></div><div class="c"><span

answers those questions in an engine called plays,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and helps you send targeted sales outreach to those companies in a timely manner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Some examples of things that our customers will research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">One, when did this company last have downtime?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe if you're selling an incident response tool, you want to know if they've had downtime and speak to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you're selling a login tool or an auth tool, maybe you want to find times where customers are complaining about login experiences,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">bad login experiences, find some links to it and include that in a timely email.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We run quite a few agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We're pushing a lot of tokens through open AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">In April, we pushed 36 billion tokens, and that has increased pretty quickly every month since.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We've learned a lot in doing this, and so we thought it would be fun to share some practical learnings of running these really generalized research agents at scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks, Connor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So going back all the way to November, the first thing we did was build the version one of our agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Sam, one of our founding engineers, and Connor both took cracks at it using the React framework, which most of you are probably familiar with by now, but just is reasoning and then acting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it allows for, like, corrective and reactive actions over the course of an agent's trajectory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So Connor and Sam both built versions of this framework, but they also built it with three core tools: searching the Internet, searching a website, and scraping a website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see here on the left we have Sambot Mark1 and ConnorAgent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We named all of our agents here, and you can see the differences in the architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The key differences here is that Sam chose to use a weaker and faster model, 4.0, for generating the plan and revising the plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And Connor chose to use 01 preview, which was the reasoning model at the time, and to generate a stronger plan, hopefully, and then lead both -- or both lead to this agentic tool use loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">After we built those, the first thing we wanted to know is, how do we know which one is better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So before we built any evals or any metrics, we spent a lot of time looking at the traces to see -- and the trajectories -- to see, okay, which one's working better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we found initially is that 01 produced much more thorough research plans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see here on the left we have 01 preview, and on the right we have 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see 01 preview and 01 are given the same prompt, and for 01 preview you have around 1,600 tokens, and only 600 for 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If we want to zoom into this plan, we can see for a specific question, which is one of the questions in the prompt, the difference in quality and specificity of output for 01 preview versus 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see we've outlined how to answer the question in 01, potential mistakes or pitfalls in 01, and also, like, even the value type or the structured output that was provided.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we found actually from these plans is that this increase in specificity and actually just general verbosity helped the agent improve outcomes downstream of this initial planning phase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But after we did this kind of vibe check, we started to build actual evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We started with just accuracy, which was just a percentage of questions answered correctly, and then hand-labeled a bunch of data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I actually hand-labeled probably, like, 500 examples across, you know, 100 companies for each of these five core data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we picked these data sets based off of what we thought the customers at the time would use our agent for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So things like, is this company B2B or B2C, firmographics and technographics, so that they can deploy these agents and accurately get answers about these companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we picked ConorAgent and Sandbot Mark 1 head to head, you can see ConorAgent came out on top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It kind of beat out Sandbot in most of these categories, and the margin was pretty significant for these tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So what did we learn from these initial evals?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So like I mentioned earlier, you know, these reasoning models had an outsized impact on downstream actions and downstream accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we also learned that accuracy-based evaluations were a good heuristic for how good an agent is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But between that and actually still having to look at the traces, we didn't have clear insights into where to go from here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we know these are the metrics that these agents produce, but how do we improve the agents?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we thought about three core axes for how do we improve these agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One is like changing the graph of the architecture, two is changing the models and the prompts, and then three was adding more tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we spent a lot of time reflecting on the customer use cases, customer needs at the time, and we wanted to enable like a lot of these initial workflows with these changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So we picked changing the models in the prompt and adding more tools as the first two areas that we wanted to invest in for improvements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll talk a little bit about a couple of the cool learnings we had from doing model and prompt changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing we want to do is kind of optimize for performance and cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">01, 03, and 01 Preview were pretty expensive, and they were also pretty slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and also in the start of this year, seemingly new models were coming out like week after week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're often just plugging in a new model and trying to see if it was better or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was interesting is that we didn't really see a huge difference until 4.1 came out recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's the only model we replaced 01 with in production for agentic planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the outcome of this change was that an initial agent run that used to cost around 35 cents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">now costs around 10 cents with 4.1 with similar performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see here the number of other models that we tried and why 4.1 is the best or most cost effective model for our planning and our agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we tried even Deep Seek, Cloud 3.7, Gemini 2.5 recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing to know, I guess, for Deep Seek was that when it came out, it was really promising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was only until probably like a week or two ago when latency was down to an acceptable threshold or similar to like 01 for these tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing we came across was date formatting, which is pretty interesting, where we had a bunch of models fail to correctly identify what date was in the future, just because of the format it was in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we saw that 4.0 struggled with something like 5.14, 2025 at 3 versus May 15th, 2024, because the day was in the future, it actually thought that the date of 2024 was in the future as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've done some adjustments and prompting just by providing actually different versions of the date and improve the performance and standardize accuracy on a date-based task across models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last main thing was how do we improve tool calling?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something we're still working on, but initially the huge problem was that agents were making throwaway tool calls, something like searching for B2B, just generally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we did is we ended up changing a lot of the Pydantic models for these input schemas for tools to force the tool calling node or tool calling agent to change the input schema and think a little bit more about what it was calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So just overall across prompt and model changes, we learned that, you know, agent costs are going down a lot because we were able to swap 01 to 41 for agentic planning with no notable quality change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And also we learned there's a ton of edge cases that evals don't necessarily catch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if you build a lot of robust evals, you're probably still going to find yourself looking at the traces to do some kind of human eval or human vibe check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's even notable from OpenAI recently with their changes in the models in ChatGPT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We also learned models tend to spike in different use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So using a model in planning might not be as effective in tool calling or reflecting or in different parts of your agent workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you probably want to do some kind of node-based eval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the second axis was building more tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we needed to think about what tools we needed to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we thought about, okay, what use cases can we not support today that we really want to turn on with additional tools?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So what customers can we power new workflows with by adding just a single new tool?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the four tools that we decided to add because of this were deep internet research, browser access, searching HTML, and dataset access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'll go through a couple of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So why we started with deep internet research is that internet search is still hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Between SEO articles on Google and as well as with search grounding with LLMs, with things like OpenAI and perplexity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're left with a lot of result qualities out of your hands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also saw that in our agentic use that tools or calls to internet were not being utilized like we would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So like this is how we would conduct research on the internet before using LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we thought about how do we do it today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're pretty good at doing internet research, but we do it fundamentally differently than agents were doing it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or how our agents were doing it initially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">When you do a search on Google, you might search for a query, look at the top 10 links,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">implicitly filter out probably five of those just based on the source,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">open a couple of new tabs, maybe read through a couple of sentences on each,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">before deciding that you need to do a different search query or that you found your answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we saw that our agents were not mimicking this common behavior,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we wanted to adjust course to improve agent result quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So we upgraded from our initial Pydantic model, which was initially we had a very naive structure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which is just kind of like a query term, and we've kind of flipped that to include a bunch of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">arguments with things like a category, whether we want to live crawl, including the text in the summary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and also like maybe constraining like domain or even published at date.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so by changing all these parameters, we're changing the trajectory of a Google search as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from first like reviewing just the preview from an internet search output, which is what we have on the left here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to after getting both the URL and the actual page content in one tool call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, so what this allows us to do is pull in all this content at once and sidestep this issue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that we were seeing with agents picking an answer just based on a Google search preview,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which as we know isn't always reliable or accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the second main tool we built was browser access. So how do we do it again?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of rich data online that scraping isn't able to capture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So between like online data sources or data sets that require you to enter a query,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">interactive search experience, or even things like Google Maps or images,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't really capture that content with scraping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we wanted to allow our unified agent to use the browser the same way we would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we built browser access as a sub-agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we gave this tool, which is basically browser access to this agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And what it does is it decomposes the task into a browser trajectory using O4Many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and then also uses computer use preview to actually action on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We evaluated browser use, the open source alternative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and we found that while it was marginally faster,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it struggled in more complex browser tasks, which led us to use computer use preview instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see an example of this here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's where we try to find if Google has EV parking on site.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it eventually ends up using the browser use tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It goes to Google Maps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It ends up using Street View, going through looking for an EV charging station in their parking lot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and then also flipping to a new tab in the browser to check to see if it has EV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And on that last page there, it does actually confirm between Google Maps and that page that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there is an EV charging station.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we learned a lot from these tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing we learned was, okay, we can't use this kind of naive approach to internet search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Internet search in Google is great, but you still need to empower your agent to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">look at the data, ingest the right content into context, and then action based off of that context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Deep search and this pivot to changing and pulling in content at once massively reduced the amount of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">misinterpretation we had in internet search and changed how we conducted research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKk-LfhujwI&t=850"
