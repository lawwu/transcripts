Those are very striking, strange descriptions of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">how to live.

That's really strange, and it's just telling us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">don't sink your roots too deep here in this world, whether it's happy or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's sad.

So here comes some instructions then about marriage in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">context, and Paul commends his singleness. He loves being single for ministry, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he talks about its distinct advantages, and they're of course not all advantages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Every single person knows that. So here's where the difficulties come that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Sarah's asking about, and I'll read the verses. Verse 26, "I think that in view of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is, married or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">single. Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be free. Are you free from a wife?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't seek a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned." Now, pause,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">exclamation point three times. That's an amazing statement. He's going to commend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">singleness as what he prefers and what he wishes more people would do, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, "But marrying is not a sin." Now that's a big statement to say, because if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not sinning, you're pleasing God, and if you're pleasing God, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">glorious, because sin is to displease the Lord. There's no neutral place here, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">halfway between pleasing the Lord and marriage or something. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">no neutral place. If you're not sinning, you are pleasing God. So he's saying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">marry is not sin. And then he adds, "Yet those who marry will have worldly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">troubles, literally tribulation in the flesh, and I would spare you that." So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">strange for Paul to say as a single man, because his life was so full of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">tribulation. Like he's saying, if you get married, you're gonna have trouble. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all he knew was trouble. So he has some special ideas in mind here. We need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to try to get to the bottom of it. He clearly does not mean singleness is free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">from tribulation. He was in prison every other week, and shipwrecked, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">dangerous here and there. I mean, his life was just tremendously burdened, and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">knew what it was to burn in the flesh. So he's talking about something peculiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about marriage here, which has got Sarah worked up, and me too. He says, "I want you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to be free from anxieties." And clearly he means a certain kind of anxiety, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the very next thing he says is, "The unmarried man is anxious for the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Lord." Well, you just said you don't want us to be free. You want us to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">free from anxiety, and now you say—and it's the very same word in Greek. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">want him to be anxious for the things of the Lord. So he means a particular kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of anxiety. He's trying to spare us. Now, here's the key phrases, the key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">words that Sarah brought up. "The unmarried man is anxious about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">things of the Lord." How to please the Lord. "But the married man is anxious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about the things of the world." How to please his wife. And he's divided. "And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how to be holy and embody and spirit. "But the married woman is anxious about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things of the world." How to please her husband. And so Sarah said this made her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">her efforts to please her husband sound pointless or lower in a calling than a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">missionary like Paul, and I admit it does sound like that. But I would say it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">sounds so bad that we know it can't be what Paul means in the way she's taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So let me try to illustrate. Two times Paul contrasts things of the Lord with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the things of the world. If you're not married, you focus on the things of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord. If you are married, you have to think about the things of the world. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so he says for the married person in verse 34 that he or she is divided. Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvS3ixCuh0E&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a really puzzling contrast.
