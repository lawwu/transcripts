um one question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lArgRvBV3tQ&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can ask is

uh nvidia used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lArgRvBV3tQ&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be a gaming compute
