at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the key algorithmic

to go back and say "Hey, what did we actually do last week?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And why did that work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=906"

there's a lot of information, don't worry, this is being recorded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=928"

going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is see how do we do the

use all of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">resources I showed you to help you because now quite a few of your colleagues have done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it successfully and therefore we can all help you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will show you how I did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the basic idea here is we had to download the data to a directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So to do that, I just typed "kg download" after using the "kg config" command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.640</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But once it's installed, it's as simple as saying "kg config" with your username, password</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and competition

something, it's a great idea to save the weights so you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to train it again, you can always go back later and say load weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I now had a model which predicted cats and dogs through my Redux

submit it to Kaggle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So Kaggle tells us exactly what they expect, and the way they do that is by showing us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a sample of the submission file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically the sample shows us that they expect an ID column and a label column.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The ID is the file number, so if you have a look at the test set, you'll see everyone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">got a number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's expecting to get the number of the file along with your probability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to figure out how to take your model and create something of that form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">This is clearly something that you're going to be doing a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So once I figured out how to do it, I actually created a method to do it in one step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to go and show you the method that I wrote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just added this utils module that I kind of chucked everything in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually that's not true, I'll put it in my VGG module because I added it to the VGG class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a few ways you could possibly do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically you know that you've got a way of grabbing a mini-batch of data at a time, or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a mini-batch of

you could do would be to grab your mini-batch size 64, you could grab your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">64 predictions and just keep appending them 64 at a time to an array until eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you have your 12,500 test images all with a prediction in an array.</span></div><div

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How many people solved it using

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what we wanted to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you read the Keras documentation, which you should do very often, you will find out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that Predict

target="_blank">00:25:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, for this competition, they told us they want probabilities, not labels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of calling the get_batches, which we wrote, here is the get_batches that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">wrote, you can see all it's doing is calling something else, which is flow from directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">To get Predict Generator to give you probabilities instead of classes, you have to pass in an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=4934" target="_blank">01:22:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to a point where, let's say the

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=4981" target="_blank">01:23:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we started here and kind of gradually tried to make it better and better and better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=4986" target="_blank">01:23:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we might get to a point where

| <span class="t">So the question was suggesting a particular approach to avoiding that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5000" target="_blank">01:23:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the good news, in deep learning you don't have local minimum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5007" target="_blank">01:23:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Why not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5008" target="_blank">01:23:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Well the reason is that in an actual deep learning neural network, you don't have one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5012" target="_blank">01:23:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">or two parameters, you have hundreds of millions of parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5017" target="_blank">01:23:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So rather than looking like this, or even like a 3D version where it's like something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5022" target="_blank">01:23:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like this, it's a 600 million dimensional space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5028" target="_blank">01:23:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for something to be a local minimum, it means that the stochastic gradient descent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5033" target="_blank">01:23:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">has wandered around and got to a point where in every one of those 600 million directions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5039" target="_blank">01:23:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it can't do any better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5041" target="_blank">01:24:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The probability of that happening is 2 to the power of 600 million.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5046" target="_blank">01:24:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So for actual deep learning in practice, there's always enough parameters that it's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5052" target="_blank">01:24:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">unheard of to get to a point

<span class="t">So the answer is no, for deep learning, stochastic gradient descent is just as simple as this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

works just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5077" target="_blank">01:24:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">fine.</span></div><div

target="_blank">01:25:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's take this linear example and see what it looks like in Keras.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

make it a bit more complex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5154" target="_blank">01:25:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We're

class="t">And so to calculate our y value, we'll do a little matrix multiply here with our x with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5163" target="_blank">01:26:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">a vector of 2, 3 and then we'll add in a constant of 1.</span></div><div

array with a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5257" target="_blank">01:27:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">layer and that is a dense layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5259" target="_blank">01:27:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">A dense layer is just a

it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5439" target="_blank">01:30:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">best be cat and dog here, but

thing we could do is we could write code to take this hierarchy and roll it up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5451"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5458" target="_blank">01:30:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">For instance, we could find the largest probability that's either a cat or a dog with a thousand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5464" target="_blank">01:31:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and use that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5465" target="_blank">01:31:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Or we could average all of the

| <span class="t">But the downsides here are that would require manual coding for something that should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5474" target="_blank">01:31:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">learning from data, and more importantly it's ignoring information.</span></div><div

category for a bone was very high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5486" target="_blank">01:31:26.220</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5495" target="_blank">01:31:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">vs environments that dogs are in, or even recognize things that look like cats from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5499" target="_blank">01:31:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">things that look like

linear model that takes the output of the ImageNet model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5508"

like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5569" target="_blank">01:32:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">before.</span></div><div

target="_blank">01:36:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is 0, 1 is a dog, 1, 0 is a cat, 1, 0 is a cat, 0, 1 is a dog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5796" target="_blank">01:36:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This approach where you have a vector where every element of it is a zero except for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5801" target="_blank">01:36:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">single one, for the class that you want, is called one-hot encoding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5807" target="_blank">01:36:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is used for nearly all deep learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5811" target="_blank">01:36:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I created a little function called one-hot that makes it very easy for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5817" target="_blank">01:36:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you to one-hot encode your data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5820" target="_blank">01:37:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, if your data was just like 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, one-hot encoding that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5830" target="_blank">01:37:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">look like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5832" target="_blank">01:37:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would be the kind of raw form, and that is the one-hot encoded form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5846" target="_blank">01:37:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason that we use one-hot encoding a lot is that if you take this and you do a matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5852" target="_blank">01:37:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply by a bunch of weights, W_1, W_2, W_3, you can calculate a matrix multiply, you see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5863" target="_blank">01:37:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">these two compatible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5866" target="_blank">01:37:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is what lets you do deep learning really easily with categorical

do is I want to grab my labels and I want to one-hot encode</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5881" target="_blank">01:38:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">them by using this one-hot function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5886" target="_blank">01:38:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5899" target="_blank">01:38:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see here that the first few classes look like so, but the first few labels are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5911" target="_blank">01:38:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">one-hot encoded like so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5915" target="_blank">01:38:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're now at a point where we can finally do step number 1, get the 1000 image net category</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5927" target="_blank">01:38:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">predictions for every

for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5931" target="_blank">01:38:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We can just say model.predict

with train data is going to give us the 1000 predictions from image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5944" target="_blank">01:39:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">net for our train data, and this will give it for our validation data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5948" target="_blank">01:39:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, running this takes a few minutes, so I save it, and then instead of waiting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5954" target="_blank">01:39:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">for you to wait, I will load it, and so you can see that we now have the 23,000 images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5961" target="_blank">01:39:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">are now no longer 23,000 by 3 by 244 by 244, it's now 23,000 by 1,000, so for every image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5969" target="_blank">01:39:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">we have the 1,000 probabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5971" target="_blank">01:39:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's look at one of them, train_features 0.</span></div><div class="c"><span

are 0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5983" target="_blank">01:39:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So for these 1000 categories, only one of these numbers should be big, it can't be lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5989" target="_blank">01:39:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of different things, it's not a cat and a dog and a jet airplane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5993" target="_blank">01:39:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So not surprisingly, nearly all of these things are very close to 0, and hopefully just one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=5999" target="_blank">01:39:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of them is very close to 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6002" target="_blank">01:40:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's exactly what we'd expect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6005" target="_blank">01:40:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So now that we've got our 1000 features for each of our training images and for each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6011" target="_blank">01:40:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">our validation images, we can go ahead and create our linear model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6015" target="_blank">01:40:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So here it is, here's our linear model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6018" target="_blank">01:40:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">The input is 1000 columns, it's every one of those image net

it's a dog or it's a cat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6028" target="_blank">01:40:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We will optimize it with, I'm actually not going to use SGD, I'm going to use a slightly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6035" target="_blank">01:40:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">better thing called rmsprop which I will teach you about next week, it's a very minor tweak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6039" target="_blank">01:40:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">on SGD that tends to be a lot faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6042" target="_blank">01:40:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I suggest in practice you use rmsprop, not SGD, but it's almost the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6049" target="_blank">01:40:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And now that we know how to fit the model, once it's defined, we can just go model.fit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6056" target="_blank">01:40:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and it runs basically instantly because all it has to do is, let's have a look at our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

seconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6077" target="_blank">01:41:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've got an accuracy of 0.9734, let's run another 3 epochs, 0.9770, even better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6090" target="_blank">01:41:30.120</a></span>

target="_blank">01:41:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't done any fine-tuning, all I've done is I've just taken the image net predictions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6100" target="_blank">01:41:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">for every image and built a linear model that maps from those predictions to cat or

followed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6454" target="_blank">01:47:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">by a rectified linear, which

we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6472" target="_blank">01:47:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">have always had this extra

target="_blank">01:48:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what it's doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6483" target="_blank">01:48:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's saying after you do the matrix product, do a max(0,x).</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6490" target="_blank">01:48:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we need to do is we need to take our final layer, which has both a matrix multiplication</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6498" target="_blank">01:48:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and an activation

target="_blank">01:48:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll show you why, if we look at our model, our VGG model, let's take a look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6524" target="_blank">01:48:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's see what does the end of it look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6535" target="_blank">01:48:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The very last layer is a dense layer, the very last layer is a linear

in that previous section where we added an extra dense layer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6549" target="_blank">01:49:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">why would we add a dense layer on top of a dense layer given that this dense layer has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

tuned to find cats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6563" target="_blank">01:49:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and dogs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6564" target="_blank">01:49:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">How about we remove this and instead use the previous dense layer with its 4096 activations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6574" target="_blank">01:49:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and use that to find our cats and dogs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6579" target="_blank">01:49:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So to do that, it's as simple as saying model.pop, that will remove the very last layer, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6587" target="_blank">01:49:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">then we can go model.add and add in our new linear layer with two outputs, cat and dog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6598" target="_blank">01:49:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we said VGG.findTune earlier, it was actually, we can have a look, VGG, VGG.findTune.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6614" target="_blank">01:50:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is the source code, model.pop, model.add, a dense layer with the correct number of classes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6624" target="_blank">01:50:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and the input equal to the parts interesting, that's actually incorrect, I think it's being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6632" target="_blank">01:50:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">ignored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6633" target="_blank">01:50:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So to get this little part, I will fix that later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6637" target="_blank">01:50:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's basically doing a model.pop and then model.add dense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6644" target="_blank">01:50:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So once we've done that, we will now have a new model which is designed to calculate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6651" target="_blank">01:50:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">cats versus dogs rather than designed to calculate image net categories and then calculate cats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6657"

target="_blank">01:50:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we use that approach, everything else is exactly the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6665" target="_blank">01:51:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We then compile it, giving it an optimizer, and then we can call model.fit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6675" target="_blank">01:51:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything where we want to use batches, by the way, we have to use in Keras something_generator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6681" target="_blank">01:51:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This is fit_generator because we're passing in batches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6684" target="_blank">01:51:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we run it for 2 epochs, you can see we get 97.35.</span></div><div

will get something quite a bit better than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6695" target="_blank">01:51:35.940</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:51:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact we know we can, we got 98.3 when we looked at this fine-tuning earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6706" target="_blank">01:51:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the only difference between fine-tuning and adding an additional linear layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6712" target="_blank">01:51:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We just do a pop first before we add it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6719" target="_blank">01:51:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course once I calculate it, I would then go ahead and save the weights and then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3aM6XTekJc&t=6724"
