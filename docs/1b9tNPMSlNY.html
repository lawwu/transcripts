So I'm in San Francisco. Well, I'm currently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">with my family in Houston, Texas. OK. Do you see a difference between those two places</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as far as how people react to wearing the mask? Oh, yes, absolutely. So both of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">states do not require masks. Only 14 states require masks. But my hometown of San Francisco</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">does, as does Houston. So there's a kind of a difference in between cities, between states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What I've seen is there's a lot of kind of confusion, which is quite quite reasonable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me ask you, is it a confusion or is it culture? Because I've lived in California</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and I've lived in Texas.

It could be. I mean, we'll have to see. I think what we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">seen happening, though, is when the death count goes up really high, like happened in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">New York, it wasn't until that people started saying, OK, we'll take this pill. So if winter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">comes and the death count shoots up in Texas, I think people might say, well, given a choice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">between my family dying and wearing a mask, maybe I should just wear the mask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that what it's going to take? Because we're you know, we in the United States are kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of hardheaded. You know, I just can't be. Yes, we can be. So I can understand how all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">data you have is probably absolutely true. And yet Americans, they don't like being told</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what to do. I get it. I really do. But look, you know, surely it's better than being locked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">up inside. You know, don't we want to get back to work? Here's the thing. Sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we accept some little infringements. For example, I don't want to go out and sit on a restaurant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">seat where the previous customer was not wearing pants. So we do have laws in this country</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that say put on some pants before you go out. You have a great sense of humor, Jeremy. Wearing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">pants is much less, you know, not wearing pants is much less dangerous than not wearing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a mask. If you don't wear a mask, you could kill the people around you. So please wear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">one. Sometimes, though, Jeremy, it takes almost a tragedy. It almost takes you being personally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">affected by it. Say, for example, my mother in law, unfortunately, I lost her to covid-19.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, you know, there are times when I take a mask, I try to be responsible. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that I would have a little bit more of a feeling like, oh, this is something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I should do for myself and for others. But you know what? That mask isn't really protecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you that much, just a little bit. The main thing it's doing is protecting the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">around you. So, you know, I have people in my family who have serious health risks. In</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">fact, 80 percent of Americans, I think, are considered to have comorbidities, reasons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that they'll be more at risk. And the thing is, they're not safe unless all the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">around them are wearing masks. So if we want the economy to really open up, getting rid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the lockdown won't be enough. We actually need people to feel safe. And that means people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">need to wear masks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9tNPMSlNY&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Jeremy, thank you very much for joining us and having such an interesting conversation.</span></div></div></body></html>
