I guess they're not in favor of 10% less democracy. They're more in favor of a hundred percent less democracy, but. Yeah, I think they're like too much LARPing, too much romanticizing about the Rohirrim. I don't know. What are the Rohirrim? Yeah, all of the, these guys and the Lord of the Rings.</p><p>Romanticizing monarchy is a mistake. It's worth noting that as my colleague, Gordon Tolick pointed out, as well as many others, in equilibrium, kings are almost always king and council. So it's worth thinking through why king and council is the equilibrium. Something more like a corporate board and less either the libertarian ideal of the entrepreneur who owns the firm or the monarch who has the long-term interest in being a stationary bandit.</p><p>In real life, there's this sort of muddled thing in between that works out as the equilibrium, even in the successful monarchies. So it's worth thinking through why it is that the successful monarchies aren't really monarchies, right? They're really oligarchies.</p></div></div></body></html>
