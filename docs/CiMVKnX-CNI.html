class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">realized I'd been doing something a little silly I'd been giving engineers feedback on our agents like oh it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.940</a></span> | <span

when I heard her talk I realized I needed to go from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.820</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is a v0 I hope have you most of you used v0 from Vercel before um yeah um so this is a v0 I built one of my early ones and it was um I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">called it a chat tuner it doesn't look like much but that wasn't the focus um but I could essentially um put our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">orchestrators so the system prompt for our ai orchestrator for build mode um in here and then I can modify it I can say what is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.980</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">this model um and the point of me showing this is just to say like the design of the final thing is always a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">tempting thing to design to um but now we can actually go and build tools to help us to design that um and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">brings me to like uh I have like three themes um the first theme which is feeling the material I'm a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">woodworker so you'll have to forgive the analogies to physical material but if you're going to uh design</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">something with a physical material you have to feel it right you have to what are the properties of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and you need to understand it and so I feel like before with design we were kind of looking at everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">through like layers right mock-ups and prototypes and and kind of trying to see what was going to work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and what wasn't what we need to do now is go feel the material feel feel how these models work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">my new north star is like creating an environment for these llms to shine right what's what's this form</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">factor that can

target="_blank">00:06:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">right that's that's my new goal um we're basically anything we do with an llm I feel like we're putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it in a box um and that's you also hear people say that llms are like interns like oh it's an intern with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">box um and so we need to put effort in um this was a conversation we were having about what tools does this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">uh co-worker this new form factor this new model like what tools do we give it when it shows up for work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">um and I got fixated on this idea of cursors I was like oh what happens if we just had a mouse or a</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">better and it felt like we had found the grain and found the right place

so what's really cool about this one is that as we're implementing it we've realized that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it can you can fit in other places so not just in conversational flow it can fit in line and this</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:11:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the tedious things and I was so excited about those previous two talks because there's kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">some emergence in there right like something interesting that we

most excited about those things like what what emerges from from playing we stopped playing for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">few years um when we were kind of got the internet and we were like really excited and css3 came out</span></div><div class="c"><span

playing again and so that's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.900</a></span> | <span

is it's an agent that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">curious and

um you know what would be good to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMVKnX-CNI&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">do is
