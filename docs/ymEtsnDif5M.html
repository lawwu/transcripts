target="_blank">00:01:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">- Well, I, I have to say, it's good to be reminded that it's March Madness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">but it feels like it's global madness just in terms of like the pace of everything going on in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you know, I can't believe I was in Washington last week and there's a lot of exciting stuff going on with regard to invest America on Capitol Hill and at the White House.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, congrats on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">- That, that I'm thrilled about, you know, the pace of AI, the pace of these changes coming out of Washington.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, a lot of which I think is total, is really fantastic, but it's, you know, certainly unsettling the markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last couple of days I've been at, down at GTC, the big NVIDIA developer event, you know, while there's a lot of uncertainty in the world, you know, I'm super bullish on where all of this is headed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is one of those moments at times where I just feel like you have to hold these two competing, but simultaneous truths that things really are accelerating and that we're getting ourselves in a position for this period of, you know, the golden age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, still that some of this caution is warranted in the short run as we try to figure out how it all unfolds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">- And for those, those that listen to us regularly, they'll know that, that, you know, many months ago, you expressed this concern that some of the changes were going to create disruption in the financial markets and that you were getting more cautious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">- And that played out, I guess everything moves fast these days, but that played out extremely quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the markets have corrected the MAG-7, I think the cover of Barron's had the list of the MAG-7 and how down they all are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, I mean, anytime you get a correction, then people immediately want to know now what, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so did, has the air come out that you expected and now it's something different or do you remain cautious?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">- I think it was like on February 4th or February 6th, we did that pod and I said, you know, well, I think the golden age will come, that first we have to go through this golden age of uncertainty, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">- That we had kind of maximum political uncertainty, maximum economic uncertainty, maximum technological uncertainty that causes discount rates to go up, you know, causes risk premiums to go up, causes multiples to come down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the first leg of that, I think the, the, the NASDAQ's down about 10%, um, since that moment, I think a lot of the components of the NASDAQ are down much more 20, 30%, right since that moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, and I think that's just the gas of uncertainty being let out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And just in the last week or so, Bill, we started rolling over to the second potential leg of concern, which is fear of recession and growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I would tell you-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">- Which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if people fear, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">- Absolutely, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in fact, what everybody is now wringing their hands about, right, is where are we today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">- So I think it's a mixed message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so let me give you a couple of the data points that we're looking at, we're collecting on both sides of the message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, first, I would say that kind of the negative data points have been gathering steam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What are those?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, consumer confidence is worsening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is consumers worried about their jobs is up to a really, uh, a much higher level than it's been out over the course of the last several years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Business confidence is worsening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a record high share of consumers think business conditions, right, are worsening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we hear on CNBC from Delta Airlines at first, and then from United Airlines, and then from Frontier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=315"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, you know, the airline stocks is kind of the bleeding edge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, am I going to fly to

interesting chart that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll post on

And so there's this, you know, there's this, you know, volume dial where they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">all turned down the volume dial a little bit, but they all kind of want to get back in before this plays</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">through. So that's the question. Are we in for another five to 10 percent leg down, right? Can we find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">a bottom for the market or are we going to get a clearing event?

You know, they asked that question to Moynihan this morning on CNBC. They said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">how can consumer spending, you know, be good if the airline data is ticking down?

So they're spending on local entertainment and, you know, restaurants,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">etc. And they're, you know, the bigger ticket items are turning down. He said, but in the wash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're looking at 1.5 trillion of consumer spending per quarter.

So again, I think, you know, when you think about the Fed's median forecast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">those are forward looking forecasts.

I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">AWS is considered a little more developer friendly. They kind of started in that place, um, from the very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning, they've been more flexible and open and what they offer, you know, Microsoft, I think mostly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">leverages their corporate customer base and kind of uses that to drive their business. So Google,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">how can they differentiate security, especially in a distributed world seems like a very reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">answer to that question. And so I guess, you know, to put it all in perspective, watching all that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it makes a lot of sense that they would come to this place. Now they're still saying it might take until next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">calendar year to get this done. And I think they put up a $3.2 billion breakup fee that they lose if this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't get approved. So it's not like this is easy going. I remember when they tucked in ways and 90 days,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like even this is difficult, but I can, I can very easily see how they got to this place. And I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and you know, I'm not deep in cloud security, but I can, I can also, I have a lot of conviction that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a good idea for an area of differentiation. Well, I mean, I will tell you this. I hear it from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">every single company I'm talking to.

Green Oaks was in this and listen, Bill, I I I'll share a little vulnerability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">here, um, about, about altimeter, uh, and myself, because I've talked a lot about the search. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, what can we learn from search as we go to invest in these model companies?

They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">were right about the internet.

Well, this is a case where altimeter was an investor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">with Sutter Hill in a company called lace work.

And it was competing in a very, very similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">space. This was the thesis of lace work lace work raised a lot of money, too much money. I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">argue, uh, you know, at the time, and they, they went hard at go to market, but they didn't have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">product market fit and execution. Right. Relative to whiz. And I remember when whiz did that series B</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and I said, we've got a product issue.

And so this was a case where we lost money betting in this space. And some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">these great, great friends of ours made a lot of money betting on the competitors. You know, we've,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we've had plenty of wins here. And, uh, but this was one of those humbling times. Like, what did we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">what did we get wrong?

It is a razor's edge between, you know, the promised land and, and, and not making anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1944" target="_blank">00:32:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">because the winners tend to, to walk away with, uh, you know, a disproportionate amount of the prize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So any reflections bill, just, you've been around this for a while, 32 billion of enterprise value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">created in five years.

You,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you said they made a lot of money.

So let's not count the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">chickens just yet. Um, yeah, look, one takeaway I have, which my partners don't, they don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it's fair, but I'm going to say it anyway, repeat entrepreneurs in the enterprise space are a golden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">ticket. Like, like it is. So there are so many learned experiences about go mostly. I think about go to market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that are repeatable that you can line them up and do it again. And I always think of the work day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">example is like picture proof of this, right? It's the team that built people saw and, and they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">came and did it on the new platform and the technology stacks always changing. And when it changes, it allows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for a new entrant to come along and be disruptive relative to that. And this has happened over and over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and over again from mainframe to minis, minis to client server, client server to the internet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">internet to the cloud. It just happens over and over again. And so if you have a repeat entrepreneur</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can, you know, establish a relationship where they're going to want to come back to you again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2033" target="_blank">00:33:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">shout out to my partner, Peter Fenton, working with Brett Taylor again, which is a perfect example of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Frank Slootman. Yeah. The odds of success are way, way, way higher.

But I think it's, I think, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the key takeaway for me is that the repeat entrepreneur with a new wave in, uh, in enterprise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">is probably the best way to increase your probability of success. And even then, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you may run into what you did. So it, it, you know, it ain't easy, but it's a great outcome here. Great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">outcome for all these people.

So, so, so let's talk about that a little bit, the approval process, because I've gotten a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of questions because it's not only important to this one, Bill, it's important to the signal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Are we going to unleash animal spirits around M and A, or are we going to quash them before they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">get out of the gate? So let's talk about the FTC for a second, right? The chair of the FTC,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Matthew Ferguson, I think there've been a lot of misinformation about, uh, uh, about where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of he stands on M and A. And so the headlines that I saw over the course of the last couple of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks, um, in particular, there was a quote that I saw Bloomberg and a bunch of other people reporting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">where he said, we're not going to be deferential to the C-suite.

And people combine those two things and said, oh my God, this is a continuation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of Lena Khan. Right here. We thought we were moving into a totally different business environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but that doesn't sound good at all. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I went back and I read the transcript on, you know, a couple of his long interviews. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">they pulled those two things out of the interview, but I don't think it's reflective of where he stands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So just a couple of data points that I would add to the conversation. One is when asked specifically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">as to whether or not he differed with Lena Khan, he said really quickly, I, I've written hundreds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">pages of dissents with Lena Khan. And he said, the number one area I differ with, with, with the prior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">administration is that they lingered. They created a regulatory fear state that nobody wanted to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2190" target="_blank">00:36:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">anything because literally they would bring an action and then nothing would happen. It would just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">die over time on the vine. And it was like purgatory for all these companies. And so no deals got done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, I'm going to be a cop on the beat, but he said, number one, I'm going to go to court or get out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of the way and let business thrive. That is a totally different mindset.

So that was one of the things that was buzzing that just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">what is happening to the aggregate demand, the aggregate TAM, if you will, for the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I want to talk, drill down on that for a second, because he showed an important slide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that we'll have here, which was industry estimates on what the TAM is for AI data centers. And he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">remember, we did this podcast on February 22nd bill last year, where we laid out the data center rollout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said that the amount of compute, he was in Saudi Arabia at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the world was thinking it was going to be about $250 billion a year. So a trillion over four years. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">said, no, that's wrong by half. We're going to do $2 trillion of TAM over the next four years. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">something closer to $500 billion a year of new AI workloads, right? So data centers supporting new AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">workloads and then replacement data centers, you know, so these are, you know, x86 architected data centers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that are going to move to accelerated compute. Well, he doubled down on again at GTC. And now he's saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's going to be $1 trillion per year by 2028. So we'll include this side, but we re-forecasted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2788" target="_blank">00:46:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the slide we did last year. This is a both new AI workloads and all of the existing data centers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that he believes will be rebuilt. And when they get rebuilt, they're going to be more accelerated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's going to a trillion a year. So the market is growing much faster than people think. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">why is this happening? And I think he used a really great example. He said, as of today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you think about somebody who's writing software and they're basically hand coding the software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and they can do that without accelerated compute, right? And so you're just working in a normal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2823" target="_blank">00:47:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">on a normal, uh, database in a normal, uh, data center. And he said, but by the end of the year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the end of the year, right? Most code is going to either be refactored or written from the start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">using machine learning. It's going to be coding agents that are helping to do that. And those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">all require accelerated compute. And so if we listen to Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or Sam Altman,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">they're all saying the same thing that coding agents are going to come, they're going to displace a huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">amount of the, the handwritten code that was previously getting done on CPUs. And so that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the type of thing he showed some queries and the reasoning models and, and, and why that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">multi multiplicative and leading to much greater demand. But those were, I would say at the high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2869" target="_blank">00:47:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">level, he really made the case that demand is exploding, uh, across all of these different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">workloads, literally from, uh, he, he, he said this morning that robotics and autonomous, and autonomous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">cars was already greater than $5 billion revenue run rate for Nvidia and growing very fast. He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">so they have from synthetic biology to robotics, um, to physics, to, you know, all the stuff we see in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">consumer to enterprise it. They have this incredible stack across CUDA, which is multiple layers of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2905" target="_blank">00:48:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">software. And then finally he said, remember, we're not in the business of building chips anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That ship sailed a long time ago. We're in the business of building supercomputers.

And so, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">notwithstanding that fact, I think the market's checking them at the gate and they're saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll believe it when we see it. And I think a framework for thinking about Nvidia at this point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is this is probably a company at two, you know, 2.7 trillion.

I think in that regard, you know, they can grind a lot higher. I'll give my reflections and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, feel, feel free to, to, to push back one. As you already said, the market didn't move, which implies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2954" target="_blank">00:49:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">if you believe in the efficient market hypothesis, that there was the full absorption of data that neither</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">positive or negative, right? Uh, of what was said, uh, relative for what expectations were to, I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">think there continues to be, and maybe we should just find a way to put a pin in it. But this, this, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">argument about scaling or not scaling that I think no one's in disagreement on the reality, but a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">people like to argue it in funny ways. So I do think most people believe that the pre-training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">scaling it, if it hasn't topped out, it's at least slowed materially. And even Nvidia is talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">inference being 99.1. And so the scaling is more on inference. Everyone seems to agree with that when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3003" target="_blank">00:50:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">they say everyone got it wrong. I think that falls into that category of that, this kind of nuanced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">discussion where the bulls don't want to admit that anything isn't scaling and, and the analysts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">are just saying, well, it's shifted a little bit and that might matter. Anyway, we can forget about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">on the token count thing. No one in the previous world, let's call it Intel's heyday talked about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3028" target="_blank">00:50:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">CPU units of performance. Like how many, how many times the, the CPU transacted, if they had,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you would have had crazy exponential numbers also, they didn't, it wasn't discussed that way. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">no one's counted the CPU clocks that have happened over time. So I do find it like kind of be an ultra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">promotional way to talk about things, to talk about the token count, just because we haven't done that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the past. On, on Rubin, you know, and I'm biased because Benchmark's an investor in Cerebrus, but, um, and, and I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">expect this in a more inference focused world, you know, Rubin, which is their next gen, they started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about, there's way more on the die and the dies getting a lot bigger, which is the direction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of Cerebrus. So that, that one kind of confirms to me that we're moving more towards inference. And then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the other thing that I thought was interesting, and I'd really love your view on, he got up on stage and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">talked about being the chief revenue destroyer. And it was very kind of provocative. And I don't clear,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't fully understand. I think he may have created a bit of anxiety in his customer base,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">because he was implying that this next generation is so good that it makes the previous generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">quite unvaluable. The problem is the companies he's selling to, you know, within the past three years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3112" target="_blank">00:51:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">move from a four year depreciation to a six year depreciation on these servers. And if he's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to kill them in two years, there's a there's a there's a kind of an economic problem for these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3123" target="_blank">00:52:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">customers. Yeah, I don't you know, I was there for that. You know, and it was, I think, an off the cuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">remark that because the Blackwell generation, the GBs that they're currently selling, not the future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3137" target="_blank">00:52:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">generation, the current GBs are 40 times more capable, right, when you look at TCO than the Hopper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">generation.

So in fact, he showed a slide of the CSP demand. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">top four cloud providers in the United States and what the year over year order was, you know, hoppers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">1.3 million hopper GPUs to the top four CPUs or CSPs and comparing like time frame.

And I think his point really there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the pace of scale up and scale out bill, and how much utility that provides to the end customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the point is like, because I you know, we're investors in core, we we talked to core weaver,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">we talked to the CSPs. The reason they're elongating the depreciation cycle is because the way in which they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">build these is all the software upgrades flow naturally through to Hopper. So Hoppers continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to get better over time, even though, you know, you've got the same chip deployed. And remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">for inference, Hopper's great. You just wouldn't choose to buy more Hoppers today because the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">chip is a better TCO than the old chip was.

Yeah. I mean, listen, it's a smaller position than it was the last couple of years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">because all of our position sizes are smaller as I took down risk at the start of this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, I, I don't expect this is going to be one of those flash in the pan.

I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">number one risk on the stock is government action from DC. Um, and you know, a lot of people have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3507" target="_blank">00:58:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">asking questions about the percentage of the revenue that goes to Singapore. And then they replied and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that's billing, not shipping. And then people say, well, where is it being shipped to? And there's all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">questions about deep seek and where they trained. And I certainly think that it's impossible to stop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a startup from any country from traveling to Europe or Malaysia and running a model.

And so I, I don't think there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">solvable problem, but I also think there's a lot of angst in DC about China. I think a lot of it's misplaced and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">overly angry. I think your friends at open AI added to that last week by putting out an anti deep seek</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3550" target="_blank">00:59:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">paper that I thought was quite sad. Like if, if a company like GM or Ford were to put out a paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3557" target="_blank">00:59:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like that about BYD, we would look at them and go, oh, you just want the government's help. You must be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">uncompetitive.

I think it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">bipartisan issue.

I do think it's a interesting moment in time for meta in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4210" target="_blank">01:10:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to consider maybe going left and getting even more open with Lama, which I think would be really powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4218" target="_blank">01:10:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">for them. Um, and this probably won't happen, but even open AI could consider doing that. If you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4224" target="_blank">01:10:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">right, that they're a consumer product company, there's not much risk in taking that leap. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">would undermine anyone else that's trying to compete based on the quality of their proprietary model. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4238" target="_blank">01:10:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">anyway, I wanted to bring that up. Where were you? Well, I, listen, you've been appropriately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4246" target="_blank">01:10:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">tough in asking questions about, uh, the gross and the, the contribution margins for these businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4254" target="_blank">01:10:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And so I saw a report recently on Anthropic suggesting that they had lower contribution margin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4261" target="_blank">01:11:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so let's just first just unpack what that is. So, you know, contribution margin is basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you know, what, what do I have to pay as a variable cost to, you know, provide the service that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">providing. So in the case of Anthropic, most of, of, uh, their enterprise API, I believe is sold through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4282" target="_blank">01:11:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">AWS and they have to pay a huge customer acquisition fee. In the world of Google, we would call it TAC,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4288" target="_blank">01:11:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">um, probably to, to Amazon. And then of course you have all the costs that you have to pay to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4294" target="_blank">01:11:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">serve, uh, the model. Right. And there's a variable cost associated with serving the model. And when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4301" target="_blank">01:11:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">take those two things into account, because of the large percentage of their revenue that is indirect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4309" target="_blank">01:11:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that they have very little or no contribution margin. Right. So no net revenue really flowing through the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">PNL now juxtapose that against somebody like open AI, where almost all of their businesses direct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4321" target="_blank">01:12:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So they don't have to pay traffic acquisition costs or rev share to anybody. Right. Um, which obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to, that has to be the business model because the cost of serving these things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4333" target="_blank">01:12:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive. Now, of course, both of those things ignore bill, your overhead and your training costs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4339" target="_blank">01:12:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And so that's truly fully loaded, but I'm just looking even at the contribution margin level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4345" target="_blank">01:12:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">because if you're not, if you're not meaningfully positive at contribution margin, then you have no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4350" target="_blank">01:12:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">chance of covering the cost, uh, on a fully burden PNL. Yeah. So, so, so here's, I've been thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4358" target="_blank">01:12:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">this a lot. I will introduce, let's just call this loosely and, uh, and a first draft, uh, an idea that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4366" target="_blank">01:12:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll call the girly negative gross margin AI theory. Okay. And yeah, here we go. Cause my brain, I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4374" target="_blank">01:12:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">wander in some pretty interesting places all by myself, but a lot of people have been comparing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4381" target="_blank">01:13:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">things to the internet revolution and, you know, I, I know why they do that. There's so much, uh, excitement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4389" target="_blank">01:13:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, for all similar reasons. And so they want metaphors and comparisons. In addition to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4396" target="_blank">01:13:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, and you just explained it, the unit economics are messy here, um, because you have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4403" target="_blank">01:13:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you have variable costs that is, especially if you're buying, you know, your compute from someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4410" target="_blank">01:13:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">else, you may have capex. And then there's a question of, are you depreciating that over how long? And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and do you charge the unit economics against that? Some of these players have credits that they were given by,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4423" target="_blank">01:13:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, by the large platforms as investors. So do you, do you really take that into account or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4429" target="_blank">01:13:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And in addition, you have tons of VC money. And so if you're going to take, if you're going to raise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4435" target="_blank">01:13:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">billions of dollars, you're going to have high burn rates. Like these things just are part of the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4440" target="_blank">01:14:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">In addition, I think there is a mindset and that, that most VC markets are winner take all. And so you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4449" target="_blank">01:14:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">can't lose market share, right? It's just, you, you can't lose market share. So if you can't lose market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4455" target="_blank">01:14:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">share, how do you price, you know, do you price to market or do you, you know, do you price to cost and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4460" target="_blank">01:14:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">value like you would in an economic textbook or do you just price to market? Meaning I can't lose because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4467" target="_blank">01:14:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of price. And so, you know, it becomes a buyer's market. I'll create a theoretical example because I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4474" target="_blank">01:14:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">think there's also an issue of stacking. Let's say you have, and let's not pick on any company. Let's say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4480" target="_blank">01:14:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a large model provider that's buying compute from a hyperscaler. And then let's say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4487" target="_blank">01:14:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a, you know, startup doing voice for the enterprise on top of that model provider. And all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4494" target="_blank">01:14:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">these people are buying compute from the one below it.

Um, because it's being subsidized by two players in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4515" target="_blank">01:15:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the middle. And on top of that, if this is true, you're triple counting revenues, right? Like there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a transaction that a consumer is making against this model, but because it's negative gross margin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4528" target="_blank">01:15:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you're literally adding it up three times.

The fact that everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4550" target="_blank">01:15:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">believes these markets are winner take all the fact that, that the founders are likely unsophisticated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">financially, not, not, not, not, I'm not like taking shots at them.

You know, and I think what I mean by that is that you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4702" target="_blank">01:18:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to have to support this level of CapEx that these companies are undertaking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4707" target="_blank">01:18:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to have to have tens of billions of dollars in high margin revenue in order to support</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4712" target="_blank">01:18:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the reinvestment that you're making on the back end of these businesses. Obviously, I think the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4718" target="_blank">01:18:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">position one at this moment, subject to change in terms of the independent players is open AI. But remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4725" target="_blank">01:18:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">for Meta, they can invest, they have a printing press kicking out billion dollar bills in the back room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4731" target="_blank">01:18:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">so they can invest against this for a long time. Amazon can Google cam to your earlier point, Bill,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4736" target="_blank">01:18:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">right, you're not going to have a clearing event here where it's winner take most because these guys will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4740" target="_blank">01:19:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">continue to throw money at it for a long time. And I would say among the other independent players,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4746" target="_blank">01:19:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Elon and Grok have a great product, have executed incredibly well, and he has a unique, very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4753" target="_blank">01:19:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">unique ability to raise global capital for a long time along with x.ai. So you absolutely can't count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4760" target="_blank">01:19:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">him out of the race. But maybe we just wrap it there. I mean, there's, you know, it's a, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4765" target="_blank">01:19:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a period of consolidation for sure. You got a lot of uncertainty in the world, you got Nvidia trading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4771" target="_blank">01:19:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">at 20 times earnings, you got a lot of questions about these companies. But we're going to turn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4777" target="_blank">01:19:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">over a lot of cards, I think, in terms of these products over the course of the next eight, 10,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4782" target="_blank">01:19:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">12 weeks, we're going to turn over a lot of cards on tariffs on, you know, kind of status of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4787" target="_blank">01:19:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">reconciliation bill and taxes, etc. And, you know, that that's what makes it interesting. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4792" target="_blank">01:19:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we could find ourselves, you know, off to the races come this summer. Or I think we could find ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4798" target="_blank">01:19:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">with, you know, in the middle of a trade war, and, and, you know, and everything's slowing down. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4805" target="_blank">01:20:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot at stake here over the next 90 days. I mean, let me let me make three final thoughts on my,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4811" target="_blank">01:20:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">on my great, my silly theory. One, I think one of the reasons this can happen also is this steep price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4818" target="_blank">01:20:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">decline we've seen on models, and older models. And so I think it's very easy for a founder or a team to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4827" target="_blank">01:20:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">say, Well, it's okay, that I have negative gross margin, or that I'm pricing here. Because look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4832" target="_blank">01:20:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens, like in six months, the compute for this will be a lot cheaper. And, and I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4837" target="_blank">01:20:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a very rational decision, too. I think that also leads to what everyone seems to be seeing what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4844" target="_blank">01:20:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">when people go to production, they look for cheaper solutions. And this is why I think open source thrives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4850" target="_blank">01:20:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">why deep seek is working on the enterprise. Like I think everyone, when they go to production,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4855" target="_blank">01:20:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">they optimize. And then, and then third, just in terms of this theory, if we're going to compare to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4861" target="_blank">01:21:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the internet area, if there are high variable costs, I think you have to think about e commerce more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4868" target="_blank">01:21:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you think about like Google, right? Like, and, and, and there were a lot of businesses, this gets back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4874" target="_blank">01:21:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">selling dollars for 85 cents, they were growing by by achieving that. And so I'm, I'm very curious how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4881" target="_blank">01:21:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it all play out. All that said, as you know, I'm a huge believer in AI, it's causing all kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4888" target="_blank">01:21:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">disruption, it's going to create all new kings and queens in the venture market. I just like getting under the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4894" target="_blank">01:21:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">hood and seeing what's happening on the margin. Well said. Well said. We're going to see a lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEtsnDif5M&t=4899" target="_blank">01:21:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in the weeks ahead.
