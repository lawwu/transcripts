In my view, it's really because money is so measurable. Peter Drucker, the management theorist, says, "What gets measured gets managed." And the reality is, a feature of money is that it is so measurable. You can place a single number next to your name and determine your entire life worth.</p><p>Unfortunately, while money is useful as a tool for a whole lot of things in our life, it is not the singular thing that contributes to a life of meaning and a life of fulfillment and happiness. There are many other things. That is really what this book is about, the five types of wealth, financial wealth being one of them.</p><p>So I am very much not saying that money doesn't matter and that you should go live off in the Himalayas meditating 12 hours a day and drinking warm broth. If you want to, by all means, go do that. I just won't be joining you. But it is a life built around these other four things in addition to money.</p><p>those other four are time wealth, social wealth, mental wealth and physical wealth.</p></div></div></body></html>
