Psalm 75 begins by saying, "For the choir director, Al-Tashayth, a psalm of Asaph, a song. We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your name is near. Men recount your wondrous deeds. For I select an appointed time, it is I who judge with equity.</p><p>The earth and all who dwell in it melt, it is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah. I said to the boastful, do not boast, and to the wicked, do not raise up the horn. Do not raise up your horn on high, nor speak with insolent pride. For one's rising up does not come from the east nor from the west, and not from the desert, but God is the judge.</p><p>He puts down one and raises up another. For a cup is in the hand of Yahweh, and the wine foams. It is full of his mixture, and he pours from this. Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink down its dregs. But as for me, I will declare it forever.</p><p>I will sing praises to the God of Jacob, and all the horns of the wicked I will cut off. But the horns of the righteous will be raised up. "</p></div></div></body></html>
