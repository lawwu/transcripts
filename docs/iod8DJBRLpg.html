It's a deep rabbit hole. Hey, listen, drop it into Notebook LM from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Google, that PDF, and ask it to make a podcast for you from that. And then just listen to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast. Yeah. Fortunately, I met these two guys who started a few companies and they were like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"We're going to start a sauna company." And they were like, "We love the Trumpkin Guide." I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "These are the guys I want a sauna from." And so that's where we got our sauna. The one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that they're working on, imagine if you could charge a battery with 110 or 120 power,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which you get from a normal outlet. And then you could build up enough juice in that battery</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to run 240 for like an hour for your sauna. It would let you put a sauna anywhere. Because one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of the biggest challenges is that sauna heaters need 240. So you've got to run electrical around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your house. If it's not in the right place, it's a pain in the ass. So they're working on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">battery solution because you don't need the sauna on 24/7. So if you had a big enough battery and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not that big... It's like a power wall for... Yeah. Exactly. But just for the sauna.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But because you don't need constant use, you could charge it 110. Yeah. And I will say one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">other thing too, that's worth looking into. And I'm not getting paid for this plug or anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but we've had Plunge, both of us as previously as sponsors on our podcast.

You can get these outdoor ones. My buddy has the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Plunge one. He actually says great things about it. It gets really hot. They're pricey. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all saunas are pricey. All saunas are not cheap. You don't want to price shop for a sauna. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">do, there's some almost heaven saunas that go on sale every now and then at Costco. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">probably the best deal. Do they get hot enough though? Almost heaven. Not quite. You're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">buying the wood sauna and it comes with a heater. You can pick your heater. It is a good sauna in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reasonable price range. The thing that I don't love is these barrel saunas. They look really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">cool. They're way cheaper. And then the more you do your research, it's just so hard to make a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">barrel sauna work to get your feet above the rocks and get the heat. And so that's one of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I learned going down the rabbit hole. Look, is a barrel sauna better than no sauna? Yeah, for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If I had to choose between a barrel sauna and no sauna, I'd take it every day. But if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go down the rabbit hole. Also, I mean, you have to consider this an investment in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">health too. You know what I mean? This is not just something that you're blowing cash for the sake of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">blowing cash. It truly is going to improve your health over the long term. For me, it's an expense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that's worth taking on. Yeah. So I'll put links to the show notes to what Haven did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because I think it's cool, especially if you don't have 240. Because I think even the plunge when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">need 240, it's amazing. Okay. So you talked about self-care. I do have one question that I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to answer the question as well. Where do you get these ideas? Rope training. Where did you find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that? It's not something I've heard really anyone ever talk about. Yeah. I mean, I have a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">community forum over at KevinRose.com where people hang out and they post inside of that private</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">little group. Somebody had posted a link to this guy's YouTube channel and we can link it up as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">well.

I'm always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">skeptical of new stuff and new people that are coming on the scene. And so I sent it over to Tim</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Ferris and Tim did some research and he's like, "Hey, actually, I trained with this guy one time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">randomly like a decade ago. This guy's legit. Let's go in deeper here." And I know he's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at, they call it more functional type movement health. And so we kind of both did a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more research and realize that he's recommending some pretty sound stuff. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">want to speak for Tim. I don't know that he's doing any of this stuff, but I'm certainly starting it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">up. And I'm a fan of trying something new. Worst case, you give it a shot for a couple of months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you literally have to buy a rope. If you don't want to buy one of the crazy, because they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">nice ropes that are like 50 bucks, right? Really well-made, they're going to last you a decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">He's like, "If you just want to give this a try, go down to Home Depot, get a $12 rope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and go practice with my free course for the first three months and see if it's for you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's one thing that I was just drawn to.

And then also I noticed that I'm getting sore in places where I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">normally get sore, which I like because that means those little muscles are getting stressed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in ways that they weren't before.

You didn't say it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and I will. When we have free time, it's just chasing random things. If I look, I wrote down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">some notes.

The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">way my brain works is knowing I have things that I need to do makes it hard to just let go and go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">down the rabbit hole and do the research. So I'm like, "Clear out that, go for a run or get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">workout in, and then go down some rabbit holes." Yeah.

And then I would add in Notebook LM is fun because you can dump in a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">different PDFs. You can make podcasts of those PDFs. So for example, I recently had a home fire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">house burned down. I dumped in my insurance policies into Notebook LM. And I said, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what are my coverages? Explain this to me. My agent is coming back and saying this isn't covered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">By the letter of these PDFs, should I push back here?" And it's like, "Yes, you should push back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">here." And I did. And I did. And I did to multiple models. But I will say that where Notebook really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">excels, and that's a great point, is when you have a PDF and you want to understand it during a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">commute. So for example- The podcast feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, exactly. So I'll take a Nature article that Nature is notorious for, one, being the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">scientific journal in the world, two being because they are the geekiest, most hardcore journal in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the world. I once bought a Nature subscription to the magazine when I was younger. You walk into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody's house and you see Nature on the table and you're like, "Ooh, they're smart." It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"I want that." Yeah, exactly. It's like having the New Yorker or something on your desk. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't understand a damn thing that was in there, very little, because it was very technical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can drop a Nature PDF in there and tell the podcast host, "Break this down at a high school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">level and give me a 15-minute podcast about it." And then you're on your commute, you're consuming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something, you're understanding it and- You can interrupt it now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

And Eleven Labs also, I will say, in my opinion, is worth checking out. I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">had a few conversations with the CEO.

Obviously, I'm not going to say what it is, but the future is bright for them. They have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">some cool shit they're working on. Yeah. So all these are fundamental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">models.

I like Snipped. I think Snipped is probably my favorite podcast app right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and largely because what it does is they process every single podcast through an AI model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and they break it into logical chunks. So before, if you went to a podcast, I'm sure you've seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this, you'd go to the show notes, and sometimes they would link up the actual areas of topics of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation where you could jump into them. Now what they've done is because of AI, you can go in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and they break it into these different chunks. They're shareable, and then you can quickly save</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">something. So I'll give you an example. Back in the day in Audible, I'd be listening to audiobook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'd be like, "Oh, that was a great little piece," right?

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it was like a five-minute process to get that little clip that you wanted to save, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what they do is they know that it takes you a few seconds to get to your phone. And they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "We think this was the clip that you really were curious about." And then I can press one tap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to send it out to Bear, to Notion, to any of those other places. Now I have that saved. It gives me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">link to the actual audio piece of it as well. So I have the data in case I want to do something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actionable on it. I can set it to do, I can do whatever I want there. And then I can click</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">through to it and listen to it again or share it with a friend. And then because the SNPs are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">social, I can see this most SNPed areas of the podcast.

The only issue with granola, I will say one thing. I tried Zoom's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2196" target="_blank">00:36:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">AI and I love it.

So it'll be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, Chris said this."

So I would have lost it regardless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But it would have been nice to have had a photo of it in a strange way just to be like, oh yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that was that object. And so just going around taking photos that are huge, those types of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sentimental things. My wife lost a lot of stuff that her parents are both past. And so she lost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">almost everything from that side, which was really devastating for her. Some key takeaways though,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that are important for everyone. I had my crypto keys outside of my house, which is great,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like pounded in steel in a safety deposit box. The safety deposit box was right down the street</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and the bank burned and like everything burned around it. The keys are fine, but move this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shit a little further away. If you're going to have backups where your jewelry and your other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things, you're moving stuff offsite, the important items, don't take it to the bank that's five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">blocks away. Because if you are in a place where there is that severe devastation, you want that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to be miles away, not necessarily right next door. That is a good takeaway. The insurance policy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2423" target="_blank">00:40:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff is huge. I mean, just getting additional riders on certain things. We had state coverage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because we couldn't get coverage for our home for the longest time, which means we were severely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">underinsured. Got really lucky in that I kept just like pushing and shopping around and eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">found someone to like pick up and add additional coverage about three months before the fires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. So we were very lucky and fortunate in that way. But yeah, I mean, those were the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">big things. And then just honestly keeping the receipts because you do have to itemize stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2453" target="_blank">00:40:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">afterwards. And does that mean like you're going through and I had 17 t-shirts and 12 pairs of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">socks and here's where I bought them? Like at what level did it get to? So basically what they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do is you're going to have a dwelling coverage and then you're going to have an inside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of the dwelling coverage, right? Your items, right? Let me give a quick run through because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2474" target="_blank">00:41:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I did a little bit of research in my own policy. So there's four types of coverage that usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">come. Coverage A is dwelling. Yes. And that's to rebuild your house. And a lot of policies have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">extended coverage. So let's say your home's worth a million dollars, you could insure it for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">million and then you could get like a 25% boost or a 50% boost. So on USAA, it's called Home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Protector Plus. Yeah. And one tip that I want to share, which I'm sure people as they rebuild in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">LA are going to realize, I know a lot of people are like a house is worth a million. So I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">need to get a full million in coverage. I can get like 700 grand in coverage and then get the 50%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">boost, which will take it to a million, 50,000. And so they use the Home Protector to give that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">boost. One of the realities I know is going to happen in LA is like, however much you thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it cost to build a house in LA is going to be significantly more expensive right now because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the shortage of supplies, the shortage of builders. So I would... 20% to 30% on change orders and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">everything else alone is going to be on top of that for sure. So I would encourage people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">not to rely on that extended dwelling coverage to get to the value of their home, which I know a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of people do. I would encourage people to ensure the value of the home and then have the extended</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">coverage be the, "Oh, I forgot to increase my policy with inflation. Oh, something happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">more natural disaster and the cost is all gone up." Yeah. And so that's one important takeaway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, I would add on top of that, it's something that's important to consider and talk to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">insurance agent about this, is that we had this additional external hardscapes like coverage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which was like a little extra policy that went above and beyond the actual dwelling coverage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And where that came into play for us is when your house burns to absolute just nothing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got... I had lithium ion like power walls and shit and like all that stuff that is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">toxic in the ground. It's your responsibility to remove all that rubble, to detoxify it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have to actually have a third party come in and certify that the ground is now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">toxin-free. So they go down about a foot and look for toxins. And that policy for us covered all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that removal and resurfacing of the land to make it livable. So even if you don't want to rebuild,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to sell that land in that working condition. And you just want to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that coverage is going to be there for you. Yeah. So then there's coverage B is other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">structures. And the way most policies work is it's some percentage of dwelling. So at USAA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2623" target="_blank">00:43:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's 10 to 100%. And this covers your sheds, patios, ADUs, pools, fences, driveways, sidewalks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all that kind of stuff. Then coverage C is your personal belongings. And for our policy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you can choose between 50 and 75% of your dwelling limits. For some reason, all of the coverage BCD</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">are usually sliders based on your dwelling. You can't kind of choose an arbitrary number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, there's no riders. Yes. Yes. But the average policy with State Farm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with USAA, you don't say, "I want 400,000 of this." You typically, and every insurance provider is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">different, you say, "I want 50% of my dwelling covered." So let me give you a little hack here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">on the C stuff. So my agent said C, the inside items. Yeah. Personal belongings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Personal belongings, he described it as this, which I thought was a great,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just a perfect analogy for it. He's like, "If I were to take your home,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I would pick it up off the ground. I would shake it." He's like, "Anything that falls out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">would be considered those personal belongings." Now, I had probably, to my detriment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">installed speakers in my ceilings and all that stuff. And he's like, "Those are hard attached.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are attached to your home, like in a way that you, if you were to, you couldn't remove</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">them without causing damage to the home. So we have to include that in the main dwelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you hit your cap there, then they're not covering the speaker." So I hit my cap on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">dwelling. So they're like, "Oh, you're out the cost of speakers. The electronics are related</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to that stuff that it was hard mounted." So it's actually to your benefit to get sound bars and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff that isn't- Now, if it's mounted to the wall-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you'll be okay with that if it's mounted to the wall. But just remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're going and doing that dream 7.1 surround sound system where it's all put into the wall and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2730" target="_blank">00:45:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">all that, they are not going to include that as- As a personal belonging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">As a personal belonging.

There are some insurance companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to be super sticklers about this stuff. Cincinnati's been awesome so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. For a great example, when we bought this house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we negotiated that they leave in one of the TVs that they put in to stage it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't have the receipt for that TV. I don't even know if it's in the contract. We were just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Hey, if you can leave the TV." Having a video of it might help prove, "Yes, there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a TV on this wall." Do I know the exact model? For expensive stuff, I've been told, "Write down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3098" target="_blank">00:51:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the model, the serial number, that kind of stuff." But I would just say that is helpful both to jog</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your memory of all the stuff you own. And then second, some insurance companies, if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have receipts, it's good to be able to show them, "Hey, what is this thing on your wall? What is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3112" target="_blank">00:51:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">worth?" And there is a coverage that I added called replacement cost coverage, which basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't depreciate all this stuff. So it's like, if you bought a TV for 500 bucks, five years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what is it worth? And this policy, this kind of coverage that I added is like, "We're not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to try to figure out what it's worth.

Do you really need to be in the city,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">though?

I'm sure there are people that are like, "I want snow all the time." This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't great for them.

They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3406" target="_blank">00:56:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">always doing weird, interesting stuff. The community is great. There's excellent food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3410" target="_blank">00:56:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We're close to an airport that has direct flights everywhere.

It's like the Bay Area is a great place to live, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive. But what would we use that savings for?

And you and I probably have stuff. It's tough. And we have half a dozen friends,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple, I don't know if you do, that moved to Puerto Rico and stuff.

He's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, I don't love living in Puerto Rico, but I save so much money."

And I think what's hard is when you're young and you're the popular kid, you don't want to lose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3983" target="_blank">01:06:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So you want to do the things that make you cool. I just wasn't. I was not that kid. And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3988" target="_blank">01:06:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not that I was the reject, but I was never the head of the class kind of person. And so it forced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=3995" target="_blank">01:06:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">me to just be who I was.

And I think I was a little bit out of the spotlight as a kid. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=4008" target="_blank">01:06:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that helped. It's actually, it's a great point. One of the things I realized in general is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=4014" target="_blank">01:06:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">when you grow up in an environment where you're not popular and you don't have a lot of money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=4020" target="_blank">01:07:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you tend to look at the world through the lens of everything is gravy from this point forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When I lost all these belongings at the house, and it was like literally all of my stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iod8DJBRLpg&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">everything, everything.
