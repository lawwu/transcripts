So in this video, I would like to continue our general audience series on large language models like Chatsheepd. Now, in the previous video, "Deep Dive into LLMs" that you can find on my YouTube, we went into a lot of the under the hood fundamentals of how these models are trained and how you should think about their cognition or psychology.</p><p>Now, in this video, I want to go into more practical applications of these tools. I want to show you lots of examples, I want to take you through all the different settings that are available, and I want to show you how I use these tools and how you can also use them in your own life and work.</p><p>So let's dive in. Okay, so first of all, the web page that I have pulled up here is chatsheepd.com. Now, as you might know, Chatsheepd was developed by OpenAI and deployed in 2022. So this was the first time that people could actually just kind of like talk to a large language model through a text interface, and this went viral and all over the place on the internet, and this was huge.</p><p>Now, since then though, the ecosystem has grown a lot. So I'm going to be showing you a lot of examples of Chatsheepd specifically, but now in 2025, there's many other apps that are kind of like Chatsheepd-like, and this is now a much bigger and richer ecosystem. So in particular, I think Chatsheepd by OpenAI is this original gangster incumbent.</p><p>It's most popular and most feature-rich also, because it's been around the longest. But there are many other kinds of clones available, I would say. I don't think it's too unfair to say, but in some cases, there are kind of like unique experiences that are not found in Chatsheepd, and we're going to see examples of those.</p><p>So for example, Big Tech has followed with a lot of kind of Chatsheepd-like experiences. So for example, Gemini, Meta.ai, and Copilot from Google, Meta, and Microsoft respectively. And there's also a number of startups. So for example, Anthropic has Claude, which is kind of like a Chatsheepd equivalent. XAI, which is Elon's company, has Grok.</p><p>And there's many others. So all of these here are from the United States companies, basically. DeepSeek is a Chinese company, and Le Chat is a French company, Mistral. Now, where can you find these and how can you keep track of them? Well, number one, on the internet somewhere. But there are some leaderboards, and in the previous video, I've shown you Chatbot Arena is one of them.</p><p>So here you can come to some ranking of different models, and you can see sort of their strength or ELO score. And so this is one place where you can keep track of them. I would say another place maybe is this SEAL leaderboard from Scale. And so here you can also see different kinds of evals, and different kinds of models, and how well they rank.</p><p>And you can also come here to see which models are currently performing the best on a wide variety of tasks. So understand that the ecosystem is fairly rich, but for now I'm going to start with OpenAI because it is the incumbent and is most feature-rich, but I'm going to show you others over time as well.</p><p>So let's start with ChatGPT. What is this text box and what do we put in here? Okay, so the most basic form of interaction with a language model is that we give a text and then we get some text back in response. So as an example, we can ask to get a haiku about what it's like to be a large language model.</p><p>So this is a good kind of example task for a language model because these models are really good at writing. So writing haikus, or poems, or cover letters, or resumes, or email replies, they're just good at writing. So when we ask for something like this, what happens looks as follows.</p><p>The model basically responds, "Words flow like a stream, endless echoes nevermind, ghost of thought unseen." Okay, it's pretty dramatic. But what we're seeing here in ChatGPT is something that looks a bit like a conversation that you would have with a friend. These are kind of like chat bubbles. Now we saw in the previous video is that what's going on under the hood here is that this is what we call a user query, this piece of text.</p><p>And this piece of text and also the response from the model, this piece of text is chopped up into little text chunks that we call tokens. So this sequence of text is under the hood, a token sequence, one-dimensional token sequence. Now the way we can see those tokens is we can use an app like, for example, TickTokenizer.</p><p>So making sure that GPT-40 is selected, I can paste my text here. And this is actually what the model sees under the hood. My piece of text to the model looks like a sequence of exactly 15 tokens. And these are the little text chunks that the model sees. Now there's a vocabulary here of 200,000 roughly of possible tokens.</p><p>And then these are the token IDs corresponding to all these little text chunks that are part of my query. And you can play with this and update it. And you can see that, for example, this is case sensitive. You would get different tokens. And you can kind of edit it and see live how the token sequence changes.</p><p>So our query was 15 tokens. And then the model response is right here. And it responded back to us with a sequence of exactly 19 tokens. So that haiku is this sequence of 19 tokens. Now, so we said 15 tokens and it said 19 tokens back. Now, because this is a conversation and we want to actually maintain a lot of the metadata that actually makes up a conversation object, this is not all that's going on under the hood.</p><p>And we saw in the previous video a little bit about the conversation format. So it gets a little bit more complicated in that we have to take our user query. And we have to actually use this chat format. So let me delete the system message. I don't think it's very important for the purposes of understanding what's going on.</p><p>Let me paste my message as the user. And then let me paste the model response as an assistant. And then let me crop it here properly. The tool doesn't do that properly. So here we have it as it actually happens under the hood. There are all these special tokens that basically begin a message from the user.</p><p>And then the user says, and this is the content of what we said. And then the user ends. And then the assistant begins and says this, et cetera. Now, the precise details of the conversation format are not important. What I want to get across here is that what looks to you and I as little chat bubbles going back and forth under the hood, we are collaborating with the model and we're both writing into a token stream.</p><p>And these two bubbles back and forth were in a sequence of exactly 42 tokens under the hood. I contributed some of the first tokens and then the model continued the sequence of tokens with its response. And we could alternate and continue adding tokens here. And together we're building out a token window, a one-dimensional sequence of tokens.</p><p>Okay, so let's come back to chatGPT now. What we are seeing here is kind of like little bubbles going back and forth between us and the model. Under the hood, we are building out a one-dimensional token sequence. When I click new chat here, that wipes the token window. That resets the tokens to basically zero again and restarts the conversation from scratch.</p><p>Now, the cartoon diagram that I have in my mind when I'm speaking to a model looks something like this. When we click new chat, we begin a token sequence. So this is a one-dimensional sequence of tokens. The user, we can write tokens into this stream. And then when we hit enter, we transfer control over to the language model.</p><p>And the language model responds with its own token streams. And then the language model has a special token that basically says something along the lines of "I'm done." So when it emits that token, the chatGPT application transfers control back to us and we can take turns. Together, we are building out the token stream, which we also call the context window.</p><p>So the context window is kind of like this working memory of tokens and anything that is inside this context window is kind of like in the working memory of this conversation and is very directly accessible by the model. Now, what is this entity here that we are talking to and how should we think about it?</p><p>Well, this language model here, we saw that the way it is trained in the previous video, we saw there are two major stages, the pre-training stage and the post-training stage. The pre-training stage is kind of like taking all of internet, chopping it up into tokens, and then compressing it into a single kind of like zip file.</p><p>But the zip file is not exact. The zip file is lossy and probabilistic zip file because we can't possibly represent all of internet than just one sort of like, say, terabyte of zip file because there's just way too much information. So we just kind of get the gestalt or the vibes inside this zip file.</p><p>Now, what's actually inside the zip file are the parameters of a neural network. And so, for example, a one terabyte zip file would correspond to roughly, say, one trillion parameters inside this neural network. And what this neural network is trying to do is it's trying to basically take tokens, and it's trying to predict the next token in a sequence.</p><p>But it's doing that on internet documents. So it's kind of like this internet document generator, right? And in the process of predicting the next token in a sequence on internet, the neural network gains a huge amount of knowledge about the world. And this knowledge is all represented and stuffed and compressed inside the one trillion parameters, roughly, of this language model.</p><p>Now, this pre-training stage also we saw is fairly costly. So this can be many tens of millions of dollars, say like three months of training and so on. So this is a costly long phase. For that reason, this phase is not done that often. So for example, GPT-4.0, this model was pre-trained probably many months ago, maybe like even a year ago by now.</p><p>And so that's why these models are a little bit out of date. They have what's called a knowledge cutoff. Because that knowledge cutoff corresponds to when the model was pre-trained. And its knowledge only goes up to that point. Now, some knowledge can come into the model through the post-training phase, which we'll talk about in a second.</p><p>But roughly speaking, you should think of these models as kind of like a little bit out of date, because pre-training is way too expensive and happens infrequently. So any kind of recent information, like if you wanted to talk to your model about something that happened last week or so on, we're going to need other ways of providing that information to the model, because it's not stored in the knowledge of the model.</p><p>So we're going to have various tool use to give that information to the model. Now, after pre-training, there's the second stage called post-training. And the post-training stage is really attaching a smiley face to this zip file. Because we don't want to generate internet documents, we want this thing to take on the persona of an assistant that responds to user queries.</p><p>And that's done in the process of post-training, where we swap out the dataset for a dataset of conversations that are built out by humans. So this is basically where the model takes on this persona, so that we can ask questions and it responds with answers. So it takes on the style of an assistant, that's post-training, but it has the knowledge of all of internet, and that's by pre-training.</p><p>So these two are combined in this artifact. Now, the important thing to understand here, I think, for this section, is that what you are talking to is a fully self-contained entity by default. This language model, think of it as a one terabyte file on a disk. Secretly, that represents one trillion parameters and their precise settings inside the neural network that's trying to give you the next token in a sequence.</p><p>But this is the fully self-contained entity. There's no calculator, there's no computer and Python interpreter, there's no worldwide web browsing, there's none of that. There's no tool use yet in what we've talked about so far. You're talking to a zip file. If you stream tokens to it, it will respond with tokens back.</p><p>And the zip file has the knowledge from pre-training and it has the style and form from post-training. And so that's roughly how you can think about this entity. Okay, so if I had to summarize what we talked about so far, I would probably do it in the form of an introduction of ChatGPT in a way that I think you should think about it.</p><p>So the introduction would be, "Hi, I'm ChatGPT. I'm a one terabyte zip file. My knowledge comes from the internet, which I read in its entirety about six months ago and I only remember vaguely. Okay? And my winning personality was programmed, by example, by human labelers at OpenAI." So the personality is programmed in post-training and the knowledge comes from compressing the internet during pre-training.</p><p>And this knowledge is a little bit out of date and it's probabilistic and slightly vague. Some of the things that probably are mentioned very frequently on the internet, I will have a lot better recollection of than some of the things that are discussed very rarely, very similar to what you might expect with a human.</p><p>So let's now talk about some of the repercussions of this entity and how we can talk to it and what kinds of things we can expect from it. Now I'd like to use real examples when we actually go through this. So for example, this morning I asked ChatGPT the following, "How much caffeine is in one shot of Americana?" And I was curious because I was comparing it to matcha.</p><p>Now ChatGPT will tell me that this is roughly 63 milligrams of caffeine or so. Now the reason I'm asking ChatGPT this question that I think this is okay is, number one, I'm not asking about any knowledge that is very recent. So I do expect that the model has sort of read about how much caffeine there is in one shot.</p><p>I don't think this information has changed too much. And number two, I think this information is extremely frequent on the internet. This kind of a question and this kind of information has occurred all over the place on the internet. And because there were so many mentions of it, I expect the model to have good memory of it and its knowledge.</p><p>So there's no tool use and the model, the zip file, responded that there's roughly 63 milligrams. Now I'm not guaranteed that this is the correct answer. This is just its vague recollection of the internet. But I can go to primary sources and maybe I can look up, okay, caffeine and Americano and I could verify that, yeah, it looks to be about 63 is roughly right.</p><p>And you can look at primary sources to decide if this is true or not. So I'm not strictly speaking guaranteed that this is true, but I think probably this is the kind of thing that ChatGPT would know. Here's an example of a conversation I had two days ago, actually.</p><p>And there's another example of a knowledge-based conversation and things that I'm comfortable asking of ChatGPT with some caveats. So I'm a bit sick, I have runny nose and I want to get meds that help with that. So it told me a bunch of stuff. And I want my nose to not be runny.</p><p>So I gave it a clarification based on what it said. And then it kind of gave me some of the things that might be helpful with that. And then I looked at some of the meds that I have at home. And I said, does DayQuil or NightQuil work? And it went off and it kind of like went over the ingredients of DayQuil and NightQuil and whether or not they help mitigate runny nose.</p><p>Now, when these ingredients are coming here, again, remember, we are talking to a zip file that has a recollection of the internet. I'm not guaranteed that these ingredients are correct. And in fact, I actually took out the box and I looked at the ingredients and I made sure that NightQuil ingredients are exactly these ingredients.</p><p>And I'm doing that because I don't always fully trust what's coming out here, right? This is just a probabilistic statistical recollection of the internet. But that said, conversations of DayQuil and NightQuil, these are very common meds. Probably there's tons of information about a lot of this on the internet.</p><p>And this is the kind of things that the model have pretty good recollection of. So actually, these were all correct. And then I said, okay, well, I have NightQuil. How fast would it act roughly? And it kind of tells me. And then is acetaminophen basically a Tylenol? And it says, yes.</p><p>So this is a good example of how ChachAPT was useful to me. It is a knowledge-based query. This knowledge sort of isn't recent knowledge. This is all coming from the knowledge of the model. I think this is common information. This is not a high-stakes situation. I'm checking ChachAPT a little bit.</p><p>But also, this is not a high-stakes situation, so no big deal. So I popped a NightQuil and indeed it helped. But that's roughly how I'm thinking about what's coming back here. Okay, so at this point, I want to make two notes. The first note I want to make is that naturally as you interact with these models, you'll see that your conversations are growing longer, right?</p><p>Anytime you are switching topic, I encourage you to always start a new chat. When you start a new chat, as we talked about, you are wiping the context window of tokens and resetting it back to zero. If it is the case that those tokens are not anymore useful to your next query, I encourage you to do this because these tokens in this window are expensive.</p><p>And they're expensive in kind of like two ways. Number one, if you have lots of tokens here, then the model can actually find it a little bit distracting. So if this was a lot of tokens, this is kind of like the working memory of the model. The model might be distracted by all the tokens in the past when it is trying to sample tokens much later on.</p><p>So it could be distracting and it could actually decrease the accuracy of the model and of its performance. And number two, the more tokens are in the window, the more expensive it is by a little bit, not by too much, but by a little bit to sample the next token in the sequence.</p><p>So your model is actually slightly slowing down. It's becoming more expensive to calculate the next token and the more tokens there are here. And so think of the tokens in the context window as a precious resource. Think of that as the working memory of the model and don't overload it with irrelevant information and keep it as short as you can.</p><p>And you can expect that to work faster and slightly better. Of course, if the information actually is related to your task, you may want to keep it in there. But I encourage you to, as often as you can, basically start a new chat whenever you are switching topic. The second thing is that I always encourage you to keep in mind what model you are actually using.</p><p>So here on the top left, we can drop down and we can see that we are currently using GPT 4.0. Now, there are many different models of many different flavors, and there are too many actually, but we'll go through some of these over time. So we are using GPT 4.0 right now.</p><p>And in everything that I've shown you, this is GPT 4.0. Now, when I open a new incognito window, so if I go to chatgpt.com and I'm not logged in, the model that I'm talking to here, so if I just say hello, the model that I'm talking to here might not be GPT 4.0.</p><p>It might be a smaller version. Now, unfortunately, OpenAI does not tell me when I'm not logged in what model I'm using, which is kind of unfortunate. But it's possible that you are using a smaller, kind of dumber model. So if we go to the chatgpt pricing page here, we see that they have three basic tiers for individuals, the free, plus, and pro.</p><p>And in the free tier, you have access to what's called GPT 4.0 mini. And this is a smaller version of GPT 4.0. It is a smaller model with a smaller number of parameters. It's not going to be as creative, like its writing might not be as good. Its knowledge is not going to be as good.</p><p>It's going to probably hallucinate a bit more, etc. But it is kind of like the free offering, the free tier. They do say that you have limited access to 4.0 and 3.0 mini, but I'm not actually 100% sure. Like, it didn't tell us which model we were using, so we just fundamentally don't know.</p><p>Now, when you pay for $20 per month, even though it doesn't say this, I think basically, like, they're screwing up on how they're describing this. But if you go to fine print, limit supply, we can see that the plus users get 80 messages every three hours for GPT 4.0.</p><p>So that's the flagship biggest model that's currently available as of today. That's available and that's what we want to be using. So if you pay $20 per month, you have that with some limits. And then if you pay for $200 per month, you get the pro, and there's a bunch of additional goodies as well as unlimited GPT 4.0.</p><p>And we're going to go into some of this because I do pay for pro subscription. Now, the whole takeaway I want you to get from this is be mindful of the models that you're using. Typically, with these companies, the bigger models are more expensive to calculate. And so therefore, the companies charge more for the bigger models.</p><p>And so make those trade-offs for yourself, depending on your usage of LLMs. Have a look at if you can get away with the cheaper offerings. And if the intelligence is not good enough for you and you're using this professionally, you may really want to consider paying for the top tier models that are available from these companies.</p><p>In my case, in my professional work, I do a lot of coding and a lot of things like that. And this is still very cheap for me. So I pay this very gladly because I get access to some really powerful models that I'll show you in a bit. So yeah, keep track of what model you're using and make those decisions for yourself.</p><p>I also want to show you that all the other LLM providers will all have different pricing tiers with different models at different tiers that you can pay for. So for example, if we go to Claude from Anthropic, you'll see that I am paying for the professional plan and that gives me access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</p><p>And if you are not paying for a pro plan, then probably you only have access to maybe Haiku or something like that. And so use the most powerful model that kind of like works for you. Here's an example of me using Claude a while back. I was asking for just travel advice.</p><p>So I was asking for a cool city to go to, and Claude told me that Zermatt in Switzerland is really cool. So I ended up going there for a New Year's break following Claude's advice. But this is just an example of another thing that I find these models pretty useful for is travel advice and ideation and getting pointers that you can research further.</p><p>Here we also have an example of Gemini.google.com. So this is from Google. I got Gemini's opinion on the matter and I asked it for a cool city to go to, and it also recommended Zermatt. So that was nice. So I like to go between different models and asking them similar questions and seeing what they think about.</p><p>And for Gemini also on the top left, we also have a model selector. So you can pay for the more advanced tiers and use those models. Same thing goes for Grok, just released. We don't want to be asking Grok 2 questions because we know that Grok 3 is the most advanced model.</p><p>So I want to make sure that I pay enough and such that I have Grok 3 access. So for all these different providers, find the one that works best for you, experiment with different providers, experiment with different pricing tiers for the problems that you are working on. And that's kind of, and often I end up personally just paying for a lot of them and then asking all of them the same question.</p><p>And I kind of refer to all these models as my LLM council. So they're kind of like the council of language models. If I'm trying to figure out where to go on a vacation, I will ask all of them. And so you can also do that for yourself if that works for you.</p><p>Okay, the next topic I want to now turn to is that of thinking models, quote unquote. So we saw in the previous video that there are multiple stages of training. Pre-training goes to supervised fine-tuning, goes to reinforcement learning. And reinforcement learning is where the model gets to practice on a large collection of problems that resemble the practice problems in the textbook.</p><p>And it gets to practice on a lot of math and code problems. And in the process of reinforcement learning, the model discovers thinking strategies that lead to good outcomes. And these thinking strategies, when you look at them, they very much resemble kind of the inner monologue you have when you go through problem solving.</p><p>So the model will try out different ideas, it will backtrack, it will revisit assumptions, and it will do things like that. Now, a lot of these strategies are very difficult to hard code as a human labeler, because it's not clear what the thinking process should be. It's only in the reinforcement learning that the model can try out lots of stuff.</p><p>And it can find the thinking process that works for it with its knowledge and its capabilities. So this is the third stage of training these models. This stage is relatively recent, so only a year or two ago. And all of the different LLM labs have been experimenting with these models over the last year.</p><p>And this is kind of like seen as a large breakthrough recently. And here we looked at the paper from DeepSeek that was the first to basically talk about it publicly. And they had a nice paper about incentivizing reasoning capabilities in LLMs via reinforcement learning. So that's the paper that we looked at in the previous video.</p><p>So we now have to adjust our cartoon a little bit, because basically what it looks like is our emoji now has this optional thinking bubble. And when you are using a thinking model, which will do additional thinking, you are using the model that has been additionally tuned with reinforcement learning.</p><p>And qualitatively, what does this look like? Well, qualitatively, the model will do a lot more thinking. And what you can expect is that you will get higher accuracies, especially on problems that are, for example, math, code, and things that require a lot of thinking. Things that are very simple might not actually benefit from this, but things that are actually deep and hard might benefit a lot.</p><p>And so, but basically what you're paying for it is that the models will do thinking, and that can sometimes take multiple minutes, because the models will emit tons and tons of tokens over a period of many minutes, and you have to wait, because the model is thinking just like a human would think.</p><p>But in situations where you have very difficult problems, this might translate to higher accuracy. So let's take a look at some examples. So here's a concrete example when I was stuck on a programming problem recently. So something called the gradient check fails, and I'm not sure why, and I copy pasted the model, my code.</p><p>So the details of the code are not important, but this is basically an optimization of a multi-layer perceptron, and details are not important. It's a bunch of code that I wrote, and there was a bug because my gradient check didn't work, and I was just asking for advice. And GPT-4.0, which is the flagship, most powerful model for open AI, but without thinking, just kind of like went into a bunch of things that it thought were issues or that I should double check, but actually didn't really solve the problem.</p><p>Like all the things that it gave me here are not the core issue of the problem. So the model didn't really solve the issue, and it tells me about how to debug it and so on. But then what I did was, here in the dropdown, I turned to one of the thinking models.</p><p>Now, for open AI, all of these models that start with O are thinking models. O1, O3 mini, O3 mini high, and O1 pro, pro mode, are all thinking models. And they're not very good at naming their models, but that is the case. And so here they will say something like, "Uses advanced reasoning," or "Good at coding logics," and stuff like that.</p><p>But these are basically all tuned with reinforcement learning. And because I am paying for $200 per month, I have access to O1 pro mode, which is best at reasoning. But you might want to try some of the other ones depending on your pricing tier. And when I gave the same model, the same prompt to O1 pro, which is the best at reasoning model, and you have to pay $200 per month for this one, then the exact same prompt, it went off and it thought for one minute.</p><p>And it went through a sequence of thoughts, and open AI doesn't fully show you the exact thoughts. They just kind of give you a little summaries of the thoughts. But it thought about the code for a while, and then it actually came back with the correct solution. It noticed that the parameters are mismatched in how I pack and unpack them, and et cetera.</p><p>So this actually solved my problem. And I tried out giving the exact same prompt to a bunch of other LLMs. So for example, Claude, I gave Claude the same problem, and it actually noticed the correct issue and solved it. And it did that even with Sonnet, which is not a thinking model.</p><p>So Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to my knowledge, is not a thinking model. And to my knowledge, Anthropic, as of today, doesn't have a thinking model deployed, but this might change by the time you watch this video. But even without thinking, this model actually solved the issue. When I went to Gemini, I asked it, and it also solved the issue, even though I also could have tried the thinking model, but it wasn't necessary.</p><p>I also gave it to Grok, Grok 3 in this case, and Grok 3 also solved the problem after a bunch of stuff. So it also solved the issue. And then finally, I went to Perplexity.ai. And the reason I like Perplexity is because when you go to the model dropdown, one of the models that they host is this DeepSeq R1.</p><p>So this has the reasoning with the DeepSeq R1 model, which is the model that we saw over here. This is the paper. So Perplexity just hosts it and makes it very easy to use. So I copy pasted it there and I ran it. And I think they render, they like really render it terribly.</p><p>But down here, you can see the raw thoughts of the model, even though you have to expand them. But you see like, okay, the user is having trouble with the gradient check, and then it tries out a bunch of stuff. And then it says, but wait, when they accumulate the gradients, they're doing the thing incorrectly.</p><p>Let's check the order. The parameters are packed as this, and then it notices the issue. And then it kind of like says, that's a critical mistake. And so it kind of like thinks through it and you have to wait a few minutes and then also comes up with the correct answer.</p><p>So basically, long story short, what do I want to show you? There exists a class of models that we call thinking models. All the different providers may or may not have a thinking model. These models are most effective for difficult problems in math and code and things like that.</p><p>And in those kinds of cases, they can push up the accuracy of your performance. In many cases, like if you're asking for travel advice or something like that, you're not going to benefit out of a thinking model. There's no need to wait for one minute for it to think about some destinations that you might want to go to.</p><p>So for myself, I usually try out the non-thinking models because their responses are really fast. But when I suspect the response is not as good as it could have been, and I want to give the opportunity to the model to think a bit longer about it, I will change it to a thinking model, depending on whichever one you have available to you.</p><p>Now, when you go to Grok, for example, and when I start a new conversation with Grok, when you put the question here, like, "Hello," you should put something important here, you see here, "Think." So let the model take its time. So turn on "Think," and then click "Go." And when you click "Think," Grok, under the hood, switches to the thinking model.</p><p>And all the different OLLM providers will kind of like have some kind of a selector for whether or not you want the model to think, or whether it's okay to just like go with the previous kind of generation of the models. Okay, now the next section I want to continue to is to tool use.</p><p>So far, we've only talked to the language model through text. And this language model is, again, this zip file in a folder, it's inert, it's closed off, it's got no tools, it's just a neural network that can emit tokens. So what we want to do now, though, is we want to go beyond that.</p><p>And we want to give the model the ability to use a bunch of tools. And one of the most useful tools is an internet search. And so let's take a look at how we can make models use internet search. So for example, again, using concrete examples from my own life, a few days ago, I was watching White Lotus season three.</p><p>And I watched the first episode. And I love this TV show, by the way. And I was curious when the episode two was coming out. And so in the old world, you would imagine you go to Google or something like that, you put in like new episodes of White Lotus season three, and then you start clicking on these links.</p><p>And maybe open a few of them. Or something like that, right? And you start like searching through it and trying to figure it out. And sometimes you luck out and you get a schedule. But many times you might get really crazy ads, there's a bunch of random stuff going on, and it's just kind of like an unpleasant experience, right?</p><p>So wouldn't it be great if a model could do this kind of a search for you, visit all the webpages, and then take all those webpages, take all their content and stuff it into the context window, and then basically give you the response. And that's what we're going to do now.</p><p>Basically, we have a mechanism or a way, we introduce a mechanism for the model to emit a special token that is some kind of a search the internet token. And when the model emits the search the internet token, the chat GPT application, or whatever LLM application it is you're using, will stop sampling from the model.</p><p>And it will take the query that the model gave, it goes off, it does a search, it visits webpages, it takes all of their text, and it puts everything into the context window. So now you have this internet search tool that itself can also contribute tokens into our context window.</p><p>And in this case, it would be like lots of internet webpages, and maybe there's 10 of them, and maybe it just puts it all together. And this could be thousands of tokens coming from these webpages, just as we were looking at them ourselves. And then after it has inserted all those webpages into the context window, it will reference back to your question as to, hey, when is this season getting released?</p><p>And it will be able to reference the text and give you the correct answer. And notice that this is a really good example of why we would need internet search. Without the internet search, this model has no chance to actually give us the correct answer. Because like I mentioned, this model was trained a few months ago, the schedule probably was not known back then.</p><p>And so when White Lotus Season 3 is coming out is not part of the real knowledge of the model. And it's not in the zip file, most likely, because this is something that was presumably decided on in the last few weeks. And so the model has to basically go off and do internet search to learn this knowledge.</p><p>And it learns it from the webpages, just like you and I would without it. And then it can answer the question once that information is in the context window. And remember, again, that the context window is this working memory. So once we load the articles, once all of these articles think of their text as being copy pasted into the context window, now they're in a working memory, and the model can actually answer those questions, because it's in the context window.</p><p>So basically, long story short, don't do this manually, but use tools like Perplexity as an example. So Perplexity.ai had a really nice sort of LLM that was doing internet search. And I think it was like the first app that really convincingly did this. More recently, Chachibti also introduced a search button.</p><p>It says search the web. So we're going to take a look at that in a second. For now, when are new episodes of White Lotus Season 3 getting released? You can just ask. And instead of having to do the work manually, we just hit enter, and the model will visit these web pages, it will create all the queries, and then it will give you the answer.</p><p>So it just kind of did a ton of the work for you. And then you can, usually there will be citations, so you can actually visit those web pages yourself, and you can make sure these are not hallucinations from the model, and you can actually double check that this is actually correct.</p><p>Because it's not in principle guaranteed, it's just something that may or may not work. If we take this, we can also go to, for example, Chachibti, say the same thing. But now, when we put this question in, without actually selecting search, I'm not actually 100% sure what the model will do.</p><p>In some cases, the model will actually know that this is recent knowledge, and that it probably doesn't know, and it will create a search. In some cases, we have to declare that we want to do the search. In my own personal use, I would know that the model doesn't know, and so I would just select search.</p><p>But let's see first, let's see if what happens. Okay, searching the web, and then it prints stuff, and then it cites. So the model actually detected itself that it needs to search the web, because it understands that this is some kind of a recent information, etc. So this was correct.</p><p>Alternatively, if I create a new conversation, I could have also selected search, because I know I need to search. Enter. And then it does the same thing, searching the web, and that's the result. So basically, when you're using these LLM, look for this. For example, Grok. Excuse me. Let's try Grok.</p><p>Without it, without selecting search. Okay, so the model does some search, just knowing that it needs to search, and gives you the answer. So basically, let's see what Claude does. You see, so Claude doesn't actually have the search tool available. So we'll say, as of my last update in April 2024, this last update is when the model went through pre-training.</p><p>And so Claude is just saying, as of my last update, the knowledge cutoff of April 2024, it was announced, but it doesn't know. So Claude doesn't have the internet search integrated as an option, and will not give you the answer. I expect that this is something that Anthropic might be working on.</p><p>Let's try Gemini, and let's see what it says. Unfortunately, no official release date for White Lotus Season 3 yet. So Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental does not have access to internet search, and doesn't know. We could try some of the other ones, like 2.0 Flash. Let me try that. Okay, so this model seems to know, but it doesn't give citations.</p><p>Oh wait, okay, there we go. Sources and related content. So you see how 2.0 Flash actually has the internet search tool, but I'm guessing that the 2.0 Pro, which is the most powerful model that they have, this one actually does not have access. And in here, it actually tells us, 2.0 Pro Experimental lacks access to real-time info and some Gemini features.</p><p>So this model is not fully wired with internet search. So long story short, we can get models to perform Google searches for us, visit the webpages, pull in the information to the context window, and answer questions. And this is a very, very cool feature. But different models, possibly different apps, have different amount of integration of this capability, and so you have to be kind of on the lookout for that.</p><p>And sometimes the model will automatically detect that they need to do search, and sometimes you're better off telling the model that you want it to do the search. So when I'm doing GPT 4.0 and I know that this requires a search, you probably want to tick that box. So that's search tools.</p><p>I wanted to show you a few more examples of how I use the search tool in my own work. So what are the kinds of queries that I use? And this is fairly easy for me to do because usually for these kinds of cases, I go to Perplexity just out of habit, even though ChatGPT today can do this kind of stuff as well, as do probably many other services as well.</p><p>But I happen to use Perplexity for these kinds of search queries. So whenever I expect that the answer can be achieved by doing basically something like Google search and visiting a few of the top links, and the answer is somewhere in those top links, whenever that is the case, I expect to use the search tool, and I come to Perplexity.</p><p>So here are some examples. Is the market open today? And this was on precedence day, I wasn't 100% sure. So Perplexity understands what is today, it will do the search and it will figure out that on precedence day this was closed. Where's White Lotus season three filmed? Again, this is something that I wasn't sure that a model would know in its knowledge.</p><p>This is something niche, so maybe there's not that many mentions of it on the internet. And also this is more recent, so I don't expect a model to know by default. So this was a good fit for the search tool. Does Vercel offer PostgreSQL database? So this was a good example of this, because this kind of stuff changes over time, and the offerings of Vercel, which is a company, may change over time, and I want the latest.</p><p>And whenever something is latest or something changes, I prefer to use the search tool, so I come to Perplexity. What is the Apple launch tomorrow, and what are some of the rumors? So again, this is something recent. Where is the Singles Inferno season four cast? Must know. So this is, again, a good example, because this is very fresh information.</p><p>Why is the Palantir stock going up? What is driving the enthusiasm? When is Civilization VII coming out exactly? This is an example also. Has Brian Johnson talked about the toothpaste he uses? And I was curious, basically, about what Brian does. And again, it has the two features. Number one, it's a little bit esoteric, so I'm not 100% sure if this is at scale on the internet and would be part of knowledge of a model.</p><p>And number two, this might change over time, so I want to know what toothpaste he uses most recently. And so this is a good fit, again, for a search tool. Is it safe to travel to Vietnam? This can potentially change over time. And then I saw a bunch of stuff on Twitter about a USAID, and I wanted to know what's the deal, so I searched about that.</p><p>And then you can dive in a bunch of ways here. But this use case here is along the lines of, "I see something trending, and I'm curious what's happening. What is the gist of it?" And so I very often just quickly bring up a search of what's happening, and then get a model to just give me a gist of roughly what happened.</p><p>Because a lot of the individual tweets or posts might not have the full context just by itself. So these are examples of how I use a search tool. Okay, next up, I would like to tell you about this capability called Deep Research. And this is fairly recent, only as of like a month or two ago.</p><p>But I think it's incredibly cool and really interesting, and kind of went under the radar for a lot of people, even though I think it shouldn't have. So when we go to Chachapiti Pricing here, we notice that Deep Research is listed here under Pro. So it currently requires $200 per month.</p><p>So this is the top tier. However, I think it's incredibly cool. So let me show you by example in what kinds of scenarios you might want to use it. Roughly speaking, Deep Research is a combination of internet search and thinking, and rolled out for a long time. So the model will go off, and it will spend tens of minutes doing with Deep Research.</p><p>And the first sort of company that announced this was Chachapiti as part of its pro offering very recently, like a month ago. So here's an example. Recently, I was on the internet buying supplements, which I know is kind of crazy. But Brian Johnson has this starter pack, and I was kind of curious about it.</p><p>And there's the thing called longevity mix, right? And it's got a bunch of health actives. And I want to know what these things are, right? And of course, so like CAKG, like what the hell is this? Boost energy production for sustained vitality. What does that mean? So one thing you could of course do is you could open up Google search and look at the Wikipedia page or something like that, and do everything that you're kind of used to.</p><p>But Deep Research allows you to basically take an alternate route. And it kind of like processes a lot of this information for you and explains it a lot better. So as an example, we can do something like this. This is my example prompt. CAKG is one of the health actives in Brian Johnson's blueprint at 2.5 grams per serving.</p><p>Can you do research on CAKG? Tell me about why it might be found in the longevity mix. It's possible efficacy in humans or animal models. It's potential mechanism of action, any potential concerns or toxicity or anything like that. Now, here I have this button available to me, and you won't unless you pay $200 per month right now.</p><p>But I can turn on Deep Research. So let me copy paste this and hit go. And now the model will say, "Okay, I'm going to research this." And then sometimes it likes to ask clarifying questions before it goes off. So a focus on human clinical studies, animal models, or both.</p><p>So let's say both. Specific sources, all sources, I don't know. A comparison to other longevity compounds, not needed. Comparison, just AKG. We can be pretty brief. The model understands. And we hit go. And then, okay, I'll research CAKG, starting research. And so now we have to wait for probably about 10 minutes or so.</p><p>And if you'd like to click on it, you can get a bunch of preview of what the model is doing on a high level. So this will go off and it will do a combination of, like I said, thinking and internet search. But it will issue many internet searches.</p><p>It will go through lots of papers. It will look at papers and it will think and it will come back 10 minutes from now. So this will run for a while. Meanwhile, while this is running, I'd like to show you equivalents of it in the industry. So inspired by this, a lot of people were interested in cloning it.</p><p>And so one example is, for example, perplexity. So perplexity, when you go through the model dropdown, has something called deep research. And so you can issue the same queries here. And we can give this to the model. And so you can issue the same queries here. And we can give this to perplexity.</p><p>And then grok, as well, has something called deep search instead of deep research. But I think that grok's deep search is kind of like deep research, but I'm not 100% sure. So we can issue grok deep search as well. Grok three, deep search, go. And this model is going to go off as well.</p><p>Now, I think, where's my Chachapiti? So Chachapiti is kind of like maybe a quarter done. Perplexity is going to be done soon. Okay, still thinking. And grok is still going as well. I like grok's interface the most. It seems like, okay, so basically it's looking up all kinds of papers, WebMD, browsing results, and it's kind of just getting all this.</p><p>Now, while this is all going on, of course, it's accumulating a giant context window and it's processing all that information, trying to kind of create a report for us. So key points, what is CAKG and why is it in the longevity mix? How is it associated to longevity, et cetera?</p><p>And so it will do citations and it will kind of like tell you all about it. And so this is not a simple and short response. This is kind of like, almost like a custom research paper on any topic you would like. And so this is really cool and it gives a lot of references potentially for you to go off and do some of your own reading and maybe ask some clarifying questions afterwards.</p><p>But it's actually really incredible that it gives you all these like different citations and processes the information for you a little bit. Let's see if Perplexity finished. Okay, Perplexity is still researching and Chachapiti is also researching. So let's briefly pause the video and I'll come back when this is done.</p><p>Okay, so Perplexity finished and we can see some of the report that it wrote up. So there's some references here and some basic description. And then Chachapiti also finished and it also thought for five minutes, looked at 27 sources and produced a report. So here it talked about research in worms, Drosophila in mice and in human trials that are ongoing.</p><p>And then the proposed mechanism of action and some safety and potential concerns and references, which you can dive deeper into. So usually in my own work right now, I've only used this maybe for like 10 to 20 queries so far, something like that. Usually I find that the Chachapiti offering is currently the best.</p><p>It is the most thorough, it reads the best, it is the longest, it makes most sense when I read it. And I think the Perplexity and the Grok are a little bit shorter and a little bit briefer and don't quite get into the same detail as the deep research from Google, from Chachapiti right now.</p><p>I will say that everything that is given to you here, again, keep in mind that even though it is doing research and it's pulling stuff in, there are no guarantees that there are no hallucinations here. Any of this can be hallucinated at any point in time. It can be totally made up, fabricated, misunderstood by the model.</p><p>So that's why these citations are really important. Treat this as your first draft. Treat this as papers to look at, but don't take this as definitely true. So here, what I would do now is I would actually go into these papers and I would try to understand, is Chachapiti understanding it correctly?</p><p>And maybe I have some follow-up questions, et cetera, so you can do all that. But still incredibly useful to see these reports once in a while, to get a bunch of sources that you might want to descend into afterwards. Okay, so just like before, I wanted to show a few brief examples of how I've used deep research.</p><p>So for example, I was trying to change a browser because Chrome upset me, and so it deleted all my tabs. So I was looking at either Brave or Arc, and I was most interested in which one is more private. And basically, Chachapiti compiled this report for me, and this was actually quite helpful.</p><p>And I went into some of the sources and I understood why Brave is basically TLDR significantly better. And that's why, for example, here, I'm using Brave because I've switched to it now. And so this is an example of basically researching different kinds of products and comparing them. I think that's a good fit for deep research.</p><p>Here, I wanted to know about a life extension in mice. So it kind of gave me a very long reading, but basically mice are an animal model for longevity, and different labs have tried to extend it with various techniques. And then here, I wanted to explore LLM labs in the USA, and I wanted a table of how large they are, how much funding they've had, et cetera.</p><p>So this is the table that it produced. Now, this table is basically hit and miss, unfortunately. So I wanted to show it as an example of a failure. I think some of these numbers, I didn't fully check them, but they don't seem way too wrong. Some of this looks wrong.</p><p>But the big omission I definitely see is that XAI is not here, which I think is a really major omission. And then also, conversely, Hugging Face should probably not be here because I asked specifically about LLM labs in the USA. And also, Eleuther AI, I don't think should count as a major LLM lab due to mostly its resources.</p><p>And so I think it's kind of a hit and miss. Things are missing. I don't fully trust these numbers. I have to actually look at them. And so again, use it as a first draft. Don't fully trust it. Still very helpful. That's it. So what's really happening here that is interesting is that we are providing the LLM with additional concrete documents that it can reference inside its context window.</p><p>So the model is not just relying on the knowledge, the hazy knowledge of the world through its parameters and what it knows in its brain. We're actually giving it concrete documents. It's as if you and I reference specific documents like on the internet or something like that, while we are kind of producing some answer for some question.</p><p>Now, we can do that through an internet search or like a tool like this. But we can also provide these LLMs with concrete documents ourselves through a file upload. And I find this functionality pretty helpful in many ways. So as an example, let's look at Clod because they just released Clod 3.7 while I was filming this video.</p><p>So this is a new Clod model that is now the state of the art. And notice here that we have thinking mode now as a 3.7. And so normal is what we looked at so far, but they just released extended best for math and coding challenges. And what they're not saying, but it's actually true under the hood, probably most likely, is that this was trained with reinforcement learning in a similar way that all the other thinking models were produced.</p><p>So what we can do now is we can upload the documents that we wanted to reference inside its context window. So as an example, there's this paper that came out that I was kind of interested in. It's from ARC Institute. And it's basically a language model trained on DNA.</p><p>And so I was kind of curious. I mean, I'm not from biology, but I was kind of curious what this is. And this is a perfect example of what LLMs are extremely good for because you can upload these documents to the LLM and you can load this PDF into the context window and then ask questions about it and basically read the documents together with an LLM and ask questions off it.</p><p>So the way you do that is you basically just drag and drop. So we can take that PDF and just drop it here. This is about 30 megabytes. Now, when Claude gets this document, it is very likely that they actually discard a lot of the images and that kind of information.</p><p>I don't actually know exactly what they do under the hood and they don't really talk about it. But it's likely that the images are thrown away. Or if they are there, they may not be as well understood as you and I would understand them potentially. And it's very likely that what's happening under the hood is that this PDF is basically converted to a text file and that text file is loaded into the token window.</p><p>And once it's in the token window, it's in the working memory and we can ask questions off it. So typically when I start reading papers together with any of these LLMs, I just ask for, "Can you give me a summary of this paper?" Let's see what Claude 3.7 says.</p><p>Okay, I'm exceeding the length limit of this chat. Oh, God. Really? Oh, damn. Okay, well, let's try chat GPT. Can you summarize this paper? And we're using GPT 4.0 and we're not using thinking, which is okay. We can start by not thinking. Reading documents. Summary of the paper, "Genome Modeling and Design Across All Domains of Life." So this paper introduces Evo 2 large-scale biological foundation model and then key features and so on.</p><p>So I personally find this pretty helpful. And then we can kind of go back and forth. And as I'm reading through the abstract and the introduction, et cetera, I am asking questions of the LLM and it's kind of making it easier for me to understand the paper. Another way that I like to use this functionality extensively is when I'm reading books.</p><p>It is rarely ever the case anymore that I read books just by myself. I always involve an LLM to help me read a book. So a good example of that recently is The Wealth of Nations, which I was reading recently. And it is a book from 1776 written by Adam Smith and it's kind of like the foundation of classical economics.</p><p>And it's a really good book. And it's kind of just very interesting to me that it was written so long ago, but it has a lot of modern day kind of like, it's just got a lot of insights that I think are very timely even today. So the way I read books now, as an example, is you basically pull up the book and you have to get access to like the raw content of that information.</p><p>In the case of Wealth of Nations, this is easy because it is from 1776. So you can just find it on Wealth Project Gutenberg as an example. And then basically find the chapter that you are currently reading. So as an example, let's read this chapter from book one. And this chapter I was reading recently, and it kind of goes into the division of labor and how it is limited by the extent of the market.</p><p>Roughly speaking, if your market is very small, then people can't specialize. And specialization is what is basically huge. Specialization is extremely important for wealth creation because you can have experts who specialize in their simple little task. But you can only do that at scale because without the scale, you don't have a large enough market to sell to your specialization.</p><p>So what we do is we copy paste this book, this chapter, at least. This is how I like to do it. We go to say Claude and we say something like, "We are reading the Wealth of Nations." Now remember, Claude has knowledge of the Wealth of Nations but probably doesn't remember exactly the content of this chapter.</p><p>So it wouldn't make sense to ask Claude questions about this chapter directly because he probably doesn't remember what the chapter is about. But we can remind Claude by loading this into the context window. So we're reading the Wealth of Nations. "Please summarize this chapter to start." And then what I do here is I copy paste.</p><p>Now in Claude, when you copy paste, they don't actually show all the text inside the text box. They create a little text attachment when it is over some size. And so we can click enter. And we just kind of like start off. Usually I like to start off with a summary of what this chapter is about just so I have a rough idea.</p><p>And then I go in and I start reading the chapter. And if at any point we have any questions, then we just come in and just ask our question. And I find that basically going hand in hand with LLMs dramatically increases my retention, my understanding of these chapters. And I find that this is especially the case when you're reading, for example, documents from other fields, like for example, biology, or for example, documents from a long time ago, like 1776, where you sort of need a little bit of help of even understanding what the basics of the language.</p><p>Or for example, I would feel a lot more courage approaching a very old text that is outside of my area of expertise. Maybe I'm reading Shakespeare, or I'm reading things like that. I feel like LLMs make a lot of reading very dramatically more accessible than it used to be before, because you're not just right away confused.</p><p>You can actually kind of go slowly through it and figure it out together with the LLM in hand. So I use this extensively, and I think it's extremely helpful. I'm not aware of tools, unfortunately, that make this very easy for you. Today, I do this clunky back and forth.</p><p>So literally, I will find the book somewhere, and I will copy paste stuff around. And I'm going back and forth. And it's extremely awkward and clunky. And unfortunately, I'm not aware of a tool that makes this very easy for you. But obviously, what you want is as you're reading a book, you just want to highlight the passage and ask questions about it.</p><p>This currently, as far as I know, does not exist. But this is extremely helpful. I encourage you to experiment with it. And don't read books alone. Okay, the next very powerful tool that I now want to turn to is the use of a Python interpreter, or basically giving the ability to the LLM to use and write computer programs.</p><p>So instead of the LLM giving you an answer directly, it has the ability now to write a computer program and to emit special tokens that the ChachiPT application recognizes as, hey, this is not for the human. This is basically saying that whatever I output it here is actually a computer program, please go off and run it and give me the result of running that computer program.</p><p>So it is the integration of the language model with a programming language here, like Python. So this is extremely powerful. Let's see the simplest example of where this would be used and what this would look like. So if I go go to ChachiPT, and I give it some kind of a multiplication problem, let's say 30 times 9, or something like that, then this is a fairly simple multiplication.</p><p>And you and I can probably do something like this in our head, right? Like 30 times 9, you can just come up with the result of 270, right? So let's see what happens. Okay, so LLM did exactly what I just did. It calculated the result of the multiplication to be 270.</p><p>But it's actually not really doing math, it's actually more like almost memory work. But it's easy enough to do in your head. So there was no tool use involved here. All that happened here was just the zip file doing next token prediction and gave the correct result here in its head.</p><p>The problem now is what if we want something more, more complicated? So what is this times this? And now of course, this, if I asked you to calculate this, you would give up instantly because you know that you can't possibly do this in your head. And you would be looking for a calculator.</p><p>And that's exactly what the LLM does now too. And OpenAI has trained ChachiPT to recognize problems that it cannot do in its head, and to rely on tools instead. So what I expect ChachiPT to do for this kind of a query is to turn to tool use. So let's see what it looks like.</p><p>Okay, there we go. So what's opened up here is what's called the Python interpreter. And Python is basically a little programming language. And instead of the LLM telling you directly what the result is, the LLM writes a program. And then not shown here are special tokens that tell the ChachiPT application to please run the program.</p><p>And then the LLM pauses execution. Instead, the Python program runs, creates a result, and then passes this result back to the language model as text. And the language model takes over and tells you that the result of this is that. So this is tool use, incredibly powerful. And OpenAI has trained ChachiPT to kind of like know in what situations to lean on tools.</p><p>And they've taught it to do that by example. So human labelers are involved in curating datasets that kind of tell the model by example in what kinds of situations it should lean on tools and how. But basically, we have a Python interpreter. And this is just an example of multiplication.</p><p>But this is significantly more powerful. So let's see what we can actually do inside programming languages. Before we move on, I just wanted to make the point that unfortunately, you have to kind of keep track of which LLMs that you're talking to have different kinds of tools available to them.</p><p>Because different LLMs might not have all the same tools. And in particular, LLMs that do not have access to the Python interpreter or programming language, or are unwilling to use it might not give you correct results in some of these harder problems. So as an example, here we saw that ChachiPT correctly used a programming language and didn't do this in its head.</p><p>Grok3 actually, I believe, does not have access to a programming language, like a Python interpreter. And here, it actually does this in its head and gets remarkably close. But if you actually look closely at it, it gets it wrong. This should be 120 instead of 060. So Grok3 will just hallucinate through this multiplication and do it in its head and get it wrong.</p><p>But actually, like remarkably close. Then I tried Clod. And Clod actually wrote, in this case, not Python code, but it wrote JavaScript code. But JavaScript is also a programming language and gets the correct result. Then I came to Gemini and I asked 2.0 Pro. And Gemini did not seem to be using any tools.</p><p>There's no indication of that. And yet, it gave me what I think is the correct result, which actually kind of surprised me. So Gemini, I think, actually calculated this in its head correctly. And the way we can tell that this is, which is kind of incredible, the way we can tell that it's not using tools is we can just try something harder.</p><p>What is, we have to make it harder for it. Okay, so it gives us some result. And then I can use my calculator here, and it's wrong, right? So this is using my MacBook Pro calculator. And two, it's not correct, but it's like remarkably close, but it's not correct.</p><p>But it will just hallucinate the answer. So I guess like my point is, unfortunately, the state of the LLMs right now is such that different LLMs have different tools available to them, and you kind of have to keep track of it. And if they don't have the tools available, they'll just do their best, which means that they might hallucinate a result for you.</p><p>So that's something to look out for. Okay, so one practical setting where this can be quite powerful is what's called chatgpt advanced data analysis. And as far as I know, this is quite unique to chatgpt itself. And it basically gets chatgpt to be kind of like a junior data analyst who you can kind of collaborate with.</p><p>So let me show you a concrete example without going into full detail. So first, we need to get some data that we can analyze and plot and chart, etc. So here in this case, I said, let's research open AI evaluation as an example. And I explicitly asked chatgpt to use the search tool because I know that under the hood, such a thing exists.</p><p>And I don't want it to be hallucinating data to me, I want it to actually look it up and back it up and create a table where each year we have the valuation. So these are the open AI evaluations over time. Notice how in 2015, it's not applicable. So the valuation is like unknown.</p><p>Then I said now plot this use log scale for y axis. And so this is where this gets powerful. chatgpt goes off and writes a program that plots the data over here. So it created a little figure for us, and it sort of ran it and showed it to us.</p><p>So this can be quite nice and valuable because it's a very easy way to basically collect data, upload data in a spreadsheet, visualize it, etc. I will note some of the things here. So as an example, notice that we had NA for 2015, but chatgpt when it was writing the code, and again, I would always encourage you to scrutinize the code, it put in 0.1 for 2015.</p><p>And so basically, it implicitly assumed that it made the assumption here in code that the valuation of 2015 was 100 million. And because it put in 0.1, and kind of like did it without telling us. So it's a little bit sneaky. And that's why you kind of have to pay attention a little bit to the code.</p><p>So I'm familiar with the code, and I always read it. But I think I would be hesitant to potentially recommend the use of these tools, if people aren't able to like read it and verify it a little bit for themselves. Now, fit a trendline and extrapolate until the year 2030.</p><p>Mark the expected valuation in 2030. So it went off, and it basically did a linear fit. And it's using scipy's curve fit. And it did this and came up with a plot. And it told me that the valuation based on the trend in 2030 is approximately 1.7 trillion, which sounds amazing, except here, I became suspicious, because I see that chatgpt is telling me it's 1.7 trillion.</p><p>But when I look here at 2030, it's printing 20271.7b. So it's extrapolation when it's printing the variable is inconsistent with 1.7 trillion. This makes it look like that valuation should be about 20 trillion. And so that's what I said, print this variable directly by itself, what is it? And then it sort of like rewrote the code and gave me the variable itself.</p><p>And as we see in the label here, it is indeed 20271.7b, etc. So in 2030, the true exponential trend extrapolation would be a valuation of 20 trillion. So I was like, I was trying to confront chatgpt, and I was like, you lied to me, right? And it's like, yeah, sorry, I messed up.</p><p>So I guess I like this example, because number one, it shows the power of the tool in that it can create these figures for you. And it's very nice. But I think number two, it shows the trickiness of it, where, for example, here, it made an implicit assumption. And here, it actually told me something.</p><p>It told me just the wrong, it hallucinated 1.7 trillion. So again, it is kind of like a very, very junior data analyst. It's amazing that it can plot figures. But you have to kind of still know what this code is doing. And you have to be careful and scrutinize it and make sure that you are really watching very closely, because your junior analyst is a little bit absent minded, and not quite right all the time.</p><p>So really powerful, but also be careful with this. I won't go into full details of advanced data analysis. But there were many videos made on this topic. So if you would like to use some of this in your work, then I encourage you to look at some of these videos.</p><p>I'm not going to go into the full detail. So a lot of promise, but be careful. Okay, so I've introduced you to ChachiPT and advanced data analysis, which is one powerful way to basically have LLMs interact with code, and add some UI elements like showing of figures and things like that.</p><p>I would now like to introduce you to one more related tool. And that is specific to Claude, and it's called artifacts. So let me show you by example what this is. So you have a conversation with Claude. And I'm asking, generate 20 flashcards from the following text. And for the text itself, I just came to the Adam Smith Wikipedia page, for example, and I copy pasted this introduction here.</p><p>So I copy pasted this here and ask for flashcards. And Claude responds with 20 flashcards. So for example, when was Adam Smith baptized on June 16, etc. When did he die? What was his nationality, etc. So once we have the flashcards, we actually want to practice these flashcards. And so this is where I continue the conversation, I say, now use the artifacts feature to write a flashcards app to test these flashcards.</p><p>And so Claude goes off and writes code for an app that basically formats all of this into flashcards. And that looks like this. So what Claude wrote specifically was this core code here. So it uses a react library, and then basically creates all these components, it hardcodes the q&a into this app, and then all the other functionality of it.</p><p>And then the cloud interface basically is able to load these react components directly in your browser. And so you end up with an app. So when was Adam Smith baptized, and you can click to reveal the answer. And then you can say whether you got it correct or not.</p><p>When did he die? What was his nationality, etc. So you can imagine doing this, and then maybe we can reset the progress or shuffle the cards, etc. So what happened here is that Claude wrote us a super duper custom app just for us, right here. And typically, what we're used to is some software engineers write apps, they make them available, and then they give you maybe some way to customize them, or maybe to upload flashcards.</p><p>Like for example, the Anki app, you can import flashcards and all this kind of stuff. This is a very different paradigm, because in this paradigm, Claude just writes the app just for you and deploys it here in your browser. Now keep in mind that a lot of apps you'll find on the internet, they have entire backends, etc.</p><p>There's none of that here, there's no database or anything like that. But these are like local apps that can run in your browser. And they can get fairly sophisticated and useful in some cases. So that's Claude artifacts. Now to be honest, I'm not actually a daily user of artifacts.</p><p>I use it once in a while. I do know that a large number of people are experimenting with it, and you can find a lot of artifacts showcases because they're easy to share. So these are a lot of things that people have developed, various timers and games and things like that.</p><p>But the one use case that I did find very useful in my own work is basically the use of diagrams, diagram generation. So as an example, let's go back to the book chapter of Adam Smith that we were looking at. What I do sometimes is we are reading The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, I'm attaching chapter three and book one, please create a conceptual diagram of this chapter.</p><p>And when Claude hears conceptual diagram of this chapter, very often it will write code that looks like this. And if you're not familiar with this, this is using the mermaid library to basically create or define a graph. And then this is plotting that mermaid diagram. And so Claude analyzed the chapter and figures out that, okay, the key principle that's being communicated here is as follows, that basically the division of labor is related to the extent of the market, the size of it.</p><p>And then these are the pieces of the chapter. So there's the comparative example of trade and how much easier it is to do on land and on water, and the specific example that's used. And that geographic factors actually make a huge difference here. And then the comparison of land transport versus water transport and how much easier water transport is.</p><p>And then here we have some early civilizations that have all benefited from basically the availability of water transport and have flourished as a result of it because they support specialization. So if you're a conceptual kind of like visual thinker, and I think I'm a little bit like that as well, I like to lay out information as like a tree like this, and it helps me remember what that chapter is about very easily.</p><p>And I just really enjoy these diagrams and like kind of getting a sense of like, okay, what is the layout of the argument? How is it arranged spatially and so on. And so if you're like me, then you will definitely enjoy this. And you can make diagrams of anything, of books, of chapters, of source codes, of anything really.</p><p>And so I specifically find this fairly useful. Okay, so I've shown you that LLMs are quite good at writing code. So not only can they emit code, but a lot of the apps like ChatGPT and Cloud and so on have started to like partially run that code in the browser.</p><p>So ChatGPT will create figures and show them, and Cloud Artifacts will actually like integrate your React component and allow you to use it right there in line in the browser. Now, actually, majority of my time personally and professionally is spent writing code. But I don't actually go to ChatGPT and ask for snippets of code, because that's way too slow.</p><p>Like ChatGPT just doesn't have the context to work with me professionally to create code. And the same goes for all the other LLMs. So instead of using features of these LLMs in a web browser, I use a specific app. And I think a lot of people in the industry do as well.</p><p>And this can be multiple apps by now, VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor, etc. So I like to use Cursor currently. And this is a separate app you can get for your, for example, Macbook. And it works with the files on your file system. So this is not a web inter...</p><p>this is not some kind of a web page you go to. This is a program you download, and it references the files you have on your computer. And then it works with those files and edits them with you. So the way this looks is as follows. Here I have a simple example of a React app that I built over a few minutes with Cursor.</p><p>And under the hood, Cursor is using Cloud 3.7 Sonnet. So under the hood, it is calling the API of Anthropic and asking Cloud to do all of this stuff. But I don't have to manually go to Cloud and copy-paste chunks of code around. This program does that for me and has all of the context of the files in the directory and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>So the app that I developed here is a very simple tic-tac-toe as an example. And Cloud wrote this in a few, probably a minute. And we can just play. X can win. Or we can tie. Oh wait, sorry, I accidentally won. You can also tie. And I'd just like to show you briefly, this is a whole separate video of how you would use Cursor to be efficient.</p><p>I just want you to have a sense that I started from a completely new project, and I asked the Composer app here, as it's called, the Composer feature, to basically set up a new React repository, delete a lot of the boilerplate, please make a simple tic-tac-toe app. And all of this stuff was done by Cursor.</p><p>I didn't actually really do anything except for write five sentences. And then it changed everything and wrote all the CSS, JavaScript, etc. And then I'm running it here and hosting it locally and interacting with it in my browser. So that's Cursor. It has the context of your apps, and it's using Cloud remotely through an API without having to access the web page.</p><p>And a lot of people, I think, develop in this way at this time. And these tools have become more and more elaborate. So in the beginning, for example, you could only say, change, like, oh, Control-K, please change this line of code to do this or that. And then after that, there was a Control-L, Command-L, which is, oh, explain this chunk of code.</p><p>And you can see that there's going to be an LLM explaining this chunk of code. And what's happening under the hood is it's calling the same API that you would have access to if you actually did enter here. But this program has access to all the files, so it has all the context.</p><p>And now what we're up to is not Command-K and Command-L. We're now up to Command-I, which is this tool called Composer. And especially with the new agent integration, the Composer is like an autonomous agent on your codebase. It will execute commands. It will change all the files as it needs to.</p><p>It can edit across multiple files. And so you're mostly just sitting back and you're giving commands. And the name for this is called Vibe Coding, a name with that I think I probably minted. And Vibe Coding just refers to giving control to Composer and just telling it what to do and hoping that it works.</p><p>Now, worst comes to worst, you can always fall back to the good old programming because we have all the files here, we can go over all the CSS, and we can inspect everything. And if you're a programmer, then in principle, you can change this arbitrarily. But now you have a very helpful system that can do a lot of the low-level programming for you.</p><p>So let's take it for a spin briefly. Let's say that when either X or O wins, I want confetti or something. And let's just see what it comes up with. Okay, I'll add a confetti effect when a player wins the game. It wants me to run React Confetti, which apparently is a library that I didn't know about.</p><p>So we'll just say okay. It installed it, and now it's going to update the app. So it's updating app.tsx, the TypeScript file, to add the confetti effect when a player wins. And it's currently writing the code, so it's generating. And we should see it in a bit. Okay, so it basically added this chunk of code, and a chunk of code here, and a chunk of code here.</p><p>And then we'll also add some additional styling to make the winning cell stand out. Okay, still generating. Okay, and it's adding some CSS for the winning cells. So honestly, I'm not keeping full track of this. It imported React Confetti. This all seems pretty straightforward and reasonable, but I'd have to actually like really dig in.</p><p>Okay, it wants to add a sound effect when a player wins, which is pretty ambitious, I think. I'm not actually 100% sure how it's going to do that, because I don't know how it gains access to a sound file like that. I don't know where it's going to get the sound file from.</p><p>But every time it saves a file, we actually are deploying it. So we can actually try to refresh and just see what we have right now. Also, it added a new effect. You see how it kind of like fades in, which is kind of cool. And now we'll win.</p><p>Whoa, okay. Didn't actually expect that to work. This is really elaborate now. Let's play again. Whoa. Okay. Oh, I see. So it actually paused and it's waiting for me. So it wants me to confirm the command. So make public sounds. I had to confirm it explicitly. Let's create a simple audio component to play victory sound, sound/victorymp3.</p><p>The problem with this will be the victory.mp3 doesn't exist. So I wonder what it's going to do. It's downloading it. It wants to download it from somewhere. Let's just go along with it. Let's add a fallback in case the sound file doesn't exist. In this case, it actually does exist.</p><p>And yep, we can git add and we can basically create a git commit out of this. Okay. So the composer thinks that it is done. So let's try to take it for a spin. Okay. So yeah, pretty impressive. I don't actually know where it got this sound file from.</p><p>I don't know where this URL comes from, but maybe this just appears in a lot of repositories and sort of cloud kind of like knows about it. But I'm pretty happy with this. So we can accept all. And that's it. And then we, as you can get a sense of, we could continue to play the sound file.</p><p>And worst comes to worst, if we can't debug anything, we can always fall back to standard programming instead of vibe coding. Okay. So now I would like to switch gears again. Everything we've talked about so far had to do with interacting with the model via text. So we type text in and it gives us text back.</p><p>What I'd like to talk about now is to talk about different modalities. That means we want to interact with the model via text. So we want to interact with these models in more native human formats. So I want to speak to it and I want it to speak back to me and I want to give images or videos to it and vice versa.</p><p>I want it to generate images and videos back. So it needs to handle the modalities of speech and audio and also of images and video. So the first thing I want to cover is how can you very easily just talk to these models? So I would say roughly in my own news, 50% of the time I type stuff out on the keyboard and 50% of the time I'm actually too lazy to do that.</p><p>And I just prefer to speak to the model. And when I'm on mobile, on my phone, that's even more pronounced. So probably 80% of my queries are just speech because I'm too lazy to type it out on the phone. Now, on the phone, things are a little bit easy.</p><p>So right now the Chatshubpt app looks like this.

It's wild, but I wouldn't put it past those political dynasties. I mean, they were all buddies back in the day. Makes you wonder if there's some secret handshake club we're not part of.</p><p>What's next? Aliens in Area 51? >> Bro, this is some kind of like Illuminati level stuff. >> Illuminati, shadow governments, lizard people. It's all connected, my friend. Trudeau, Castro, they might just be the tip of the iceberg. Next thing you know, we'll find out the queen is actually a robot.</p><p>You think I'm joking? >> Okay, let's try the sexy mode. Okay, hello? >> Hey there, Andre. I can feel the electricity in the air already. Let me take the lead tonight. Picture this. We're in a dimly lit room, the air thick with anticipation. >> I see where this is going.</p><p>>> Me, your eyes locked on mine, and I slowly start to undress. Each piece of clothing falling. >> Okay, so I think you get the idea. I think, yeah, I think you get the idea. Okay, and one more paradigm I wanted to show you of interacting with language models via audio is this Notebook LM from Google.</p><p>So when you go to notebooklm.google.com, the way this works is on the left you have sources, and you can upload any arbitrary data here. So it's raw text or it's web pages or it's PDF files, et cetera. So I uploaded this PDF about this foundation model for genomic sequence analysis from ARC Institute.</p><p>And then once you put this here, this enters the context window of the model. And then we can, number one, we can chat with that information. So we can ask questions and get answers. But number two, what's kind of interesting is on the right they have this deep dive podcast.</p><p>So there's a generate button. You can press it and wait like a few minutes, and it will generate a custom podcast on whatever sources of information you put in here. So for example, here we got about a 30-minute podcast generated for this paper. And it's really interesting to be able to get podcasts on demand.</p><p>And I think it's kind of like interesting and therapeutic. If you're going out for a walk or something like that, I sometimes upload a few things that I'm kind of passively interested in and I want to get a podcast about. And it's just something fun to listen to. So let's see what this looks like just very briefly.</p><p>OK, so get this. We're diving into AI that understands DNA. Really fascinating stuff. Not just reading it, but predicting how changes can impact everything. Yeah. From a single protein all the way up to an entire organism. It's really remarkable. And there's this new biological foundation model called EVO2 that is really at the forefront of all this.</p><p>EVO2, OK. And it's trained on a massive data set called OpenGenome2, which covers over nine-- OK, I think you get the rough idea. So there's a few things here. You can customize the podcast and what it is about with special instructions. You can then regenerate it. And you can also enter this thing called interactive mode, where you can actually break in and ask a question while the podcast is going on, which I think is kind of cool.</p><p>So I use this once in a while when there are some documents or topics or papers that I'm not usually an expert in. And I just kind of have a passive interest in. And I'm going out for a walk or I'm going out for a long drive. And I want to have a custom podcast on that topic.</p><p>And so I find that this is good in niche cases like that, where it's not going to be covered by another podcast that's actually created by humans. It's kind of like an AI podcast about any arbitrary niche topic you'd like. So that's Notebook Column. And I wanted to also make a brief pointer to this podcast that I generated.</p><p>It's like a season of a podcast called Histories of Mysteries. And I uploaded this on Spotify. And here I just selected some topics that I'm interested in. And I generated a deep dive podcast on all of them. And so if you'd like to get a sense of what this tool is capable of, then this is one way to just get a qualitative sense.</p><p>Go on this, find this on Spotify and listen to some of the podcasts here and get a sense of what it can do. And then play around with some of the documents and sources yourself. So that's the podcast generation interaction using Notebook Column. Okay, next up, what I want to turn to is images.</p><p>So just like audio, it turns out that you can re-represent images in tokens. And we can represent images as token streams. And we can get language models to model them in the same way as we've modeled text and audio before. The simplest possible way to do this, as an example, is you can take an image and you can basically create like a rectangular grid and chop it up into little patches.</p><p>And then image is just a sequence of patches. And every one of those patches you quantize. So you basically come up with a vocabulary of say 100,000 possible patches. And you represent each patch using just the closest patch in your vocabulary. And so that's what allows you to take images and represent them as streams of tokens.</p><p>And then you can put them into context windows and train your models with them. So what's incredible about this is that the language model, the transformer neural network itself, it doesn't even know that some of the tokens happen to be text, some of the tokens happen to be audio, and some of them happen to be images.</p><p>It just models statistical patterns of token streams. And then it's only at the encoder and at the decoder that we secretly know that, okay, images are encoded in this way, and then streams are decoded in this way back into images or audio. So just like we handled audio, we can chop up images into tokens and apply all the same modeling techniques and nothing really changes, just the token streams change and the vocabulary of your tokens changes.</p><p>So now let me show you some concrete examples of how I've used this functionality in my own life. Okay, so starting off with the image input, I want to show you some examples that I've used LLMs where I was uploading images. So if you go to your favorite ChassisPT or other LLM app, you can upload images usually and ask questions of them.</p><p>So here's one example where I was looking at the nutrition label of Brian Johnson's longevity mix. And basically, I don't really know what all these ingredients are, right? And I want to know a lot more about them and why they are in the longevity mix. And this is a very good example where first I want to transcribe this into text.</p><p>And the reason I like to first transcribe the relevant information into text is because I want to make sure that the model is seeing the values correctly. Like I'm not 100% certain that it can see stuff. And so here when it puts it into a table, I can make sure that it saw it correctly.</p><p>And then I can ask questions of this text. And so I like to do it in two steps whenever possible. And then for example, here I asked it to group the ingredients, and I asked it to basically rank them in how safe probably they are. Because I want to get a sense of, okay, which of these ingredients are, you know, super basic ingredients that are found in your multivitamin?</p><p>And which of them are a bit more kind of like suspicious or strange or not as well studied or something like that. So the model was very good in helping me think through basically what's in the longevity mix and what may be missing on like why it's in there, et cetera.</p><p>And this is again, a good first draft for my own research afterwards. The second example I want to show is that of my blood test. So very recently I did like a panel of my blood test. And what they sent me back was this like 20 page PDF, which is super useless.</p><p>What am I supposed to do with that? So obviously I want to know a lot more information. So what I did here is I uploaded all my results. So first I did the lipid panel as an example, and I uploaded little screenshots of my lipid panel. And then I made sure that ChachiPT sees all the correct results.</p><p>And then it actually gives me an interpretation. And then I kind of iterated and you can see that the scroll bar here is very low because I uploaded piece by piece all of my blood test results, which are great by the way. I was very happy with this blood test.</p><p>And so what I wanted to say is number one, pay attention to the transcription and make sure that it's correct. And number two, it is very easy to do this because on MacBook, for example, you can do control shift command four, and you can draw a window and it copy pastes that window into a clipboard.</p><p>And then you can just go to your ChachiPT and you can control V or command V to paste it in. And you can ask about that. So it's very easy to like take chunks of your screen and ask questions about them using this technique. And then the other thing I would say about this is that of course this is medical information and you don't want it to be wrong.</p><p>I will say that in the case of blood test results, I feel more confident trusting ChachiPT a bit more because this is not something esoteric. I do expect there to be like tons and tons of documents about blood test results. And I do expect that the knowledge of the model is good enough that it kind of understands these numbers, these ranges, and I can tell it more about myself and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>So I do think that it is quite good. But of course you probably want to talk to an actual doctor as well. But I think this is a really good first draft and something that maybe gives you things to talk about with your doctor, etc. Another example is I do a lot of math and code.</p><p>I found this tricky question in a paper recently. And so I copy pasted this expression and I asked for it in text because then I can copy this text and I can ask a model what it thinks the value of x is evaluated at pi or something like that.</p><p>It's a trick question. You can try it yourself. Next example, here I had a Colgate toothpaste and I was a little bit suspicious about all the ingredients in my Colgate toothpaste. And I wanted to know what the hell is all this. So this is Colgate. What the hell is all these things?</p><p>So it transcribed it and then it told me a bit about these ingredients and I thought this was extremely helpful. And then I asked it, okay, which of these would be considered safest and also potentially less safe? And then I asked it, okay, if I only care about the actual function of the toothpaste and I don't really care about other useless things like colors and stuff like that, which of these could we throw out?</p><p>And it said that, okay, these are the essential functional ingredients and this is a bunch of random stuff you probably don't want in your toothpaste. And basically, spoiler alert, most of the stuff here shouldn't be there. And so it's really upsetting to me that companies put all this stuff in your food or cosmetics and stuff like that when it really doesn't need to be there.</p><p>The last example I wanted to show you is, so this is a meme that I sent to a friend and my friend was confused like, oh, what is this meme? I don't get it. And I was showing them that Chachi Petit can help you understand memes. So I copy pasted this meme and asked explain.</p><p>And basically, this explains the meme that, okay, multiple crows, a group of crows is called a murder. And so when this crow gets close to that crow, it's like an attempted murder. So yeah, Chachi Petit was pretty good at explaining this joke. Okay, now vice versa, you can get these models to generate images.</p><p>And the OpenAI offering of this is called DALI, and we're on the third version. And it can generate really beautiful images on basically given arbitrary prompts. Is this the Golden Temple in Kyoto, I think? I visited, so this is really beautiful. And so it can generate really stylistic images and can ask for any arbitrary style of any arbitrary topic, et cetera.</p><p>Now, I don't actually personally use this functionality way too often. So I cooked up a random example just to show you. But as an example, what are the big headlines news today? There's a bunch of headlines around politics, health, international entertainment, and so on. And I used search tool for this.</p><p>And then I said, generate an image that summarizes today. And so having all of this in the context, we can generate an image like this, that kind of like summarizes today, just as an example. And the way I use this functionality is usually for arbitrary content creation. So as an example, when you go to my YouTube channel, then this video, Let's Reproduce GPT-2, this image over here was generated using a competitor actually to DALI called ideogram.ai.</p><p>And the same for this image that's also generated by an AI. And this image as well was generated, I think, also by ideogram, or this may have been Chachapiti, I'm not sure. So I use some of the tools interchangeably. So I use it to generate icons and things like that.</p><p>And you can just kind of like ask for whatever you want. Now, I will note that the way that this actually works, the image output, it's not done fully in the model currently with DALI 3. With DALI 3, this is a separate model that takes text and creates image.</p><p>And what's actually happening under the hood here, in the current iteration of Chachapiti, is when I say generate an image that summarizes today, this will actually, under the hood, create a caption for that image. And that caption is sent to a separate model that is an image generator model.</p><p>And so it's kind of like stitched up in this way. But it's not like super important to, I think, fully understand at this point. So that is image output. Now, next up, I want to show you an extension where the model can actually like see video. And this is included in what I showed you previously called advanced voice.</p><p>It's not available on the web app, but it's available on the mobile app. So if we go to advanced voice, and we connect. So hello, I'm demonstrating the video capabilities. And I'm showing to the camera that there is a little video icon over there. And when you press it, you can basically see, you can basically show the model different things.</p><p>I can see the camera feed. It looks like you've got some black acoustic foam panels on the wall. Are you testing out how well they reduce echo in the room? Yeah, I was testing out the acoustic foam. That's right. But it's not actually that helpful. Sometimes placement can make a big difference.</p><p>Have you tried covering more corners or experimenting with different layouts? Okay, well, let's let's look at this. What book is this? Do you know? Yes, that's Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world by Jack Weatherford. It's a fascinating book about the impact of Genghis Khan on world history.</p><p>Yeah, pretty good. Do you see this other book? What is it? That's surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman. It's a collection of humorous anecdotes from the physicist's life. It's really entertaining. And what is this? That's an Aeronet 4, a portable CO2 monitor. It measures carbon dioxide levels, temperature, humidity, and air pressure.</p><p>It's quite useful for monitoring indoor air quality. So we're currently at 713, right? Do you think that's good or what? A CO2 level of 713 ppm is generally okay. It's normal for indoor spaces. Ideally, you want it below 800 ppm. If it goes above 1000, you might need more ventilation.</p><p>Got it. And how about this map? Do you know what this map is? Yes, that looks like a map of Middle Earth from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It's a great piece for any fan of the series. Yeah, good job. Thank you for the demonstration. You're welcome.</p><p>Glad I could help. If you need anything else, just let me know. So that's a brief demo. You basically have the camera running, you can point it at stuff, and you can just talk to the model. It is quite magical, super simple to use. I don't personally use it in my daily life because I'm kind of like a power user of all the chat GPT apps, and I don't kind of just like go around pointing at stuff and asking the model for stuff.</p><p>I usually have very targeted queries about code and programming, etc. But I think if I was demonstrating some of this to my parents or my grandparents and have them interact in a very natural way, this is something that I would probably show them, because they can just point the camera at things and ask questions.</p><p>Now, under the hood, I'm not actually 100% sure that they currently consume the video. I think they actually still just take image sections, like for example, they take one image per second or something like that. But from your perspective as a user of the tool, it definitely feels like you can just stream it video and have it make sense.</p><p>So I think that's pretty cool as a functionality. And finally, I want to briefly show you that there's a lot of tools now that can generate videos, and they are incredible, and they're very rapidly evolving. I'm not going to cover this too extensively because I don't... I think it's relatively self-explanatory.</p><p>I don't personally use them that much in my work, but that's just because I'm not in a kind of a creative profession or something like that. So this is a tweet that compares a number of AI video generation models as an example. This tweet is from about a month ago, so this may have evolved since.</p><p>But I just wanted to show you that all of these models were asked to generate, I guess, a tiger in a jungle. And this is a tweet from a month ago, so this may have evolved since. But I just wanted to show you that all of these models were asked to generate, I guess, a tiger in a jungle.</p><p>And they're all quite good. I think right now, VO2, I think, is really near state-of-the-art and really good. Yeah, that's pretty incredible, right? This is OpenAI Sora, etc. And you can compare and contrast and use some of these tools that are dedicated to this problem. Okay, and the final topic I want to turn to is some quality of life features that I think are quite worth mentioning.</p><p>So the first one I want to talk about is ChatGPT memory feature. So say you're talking to ChatGPT, and you say something like, "When roughly do you think we'll speak Hollywood?" Now, I'm actually surprised that ChatGPT gave me an answer here because I feel like very often, these models are very averse to actually having any opinions.</p><p>And they say something along the lines of, "Oh, I'm just an AI. I'm here to help. I don't have any opinions," and stuff like that. So here, actually, it seems to have an opinion and say it says that the last true peak before franchises took over was 1990s to early 2000s.</p><p>So I actually happen to really agree with ChatGPT here. And I really agree, so totally agreed. Now, I'm curious what happens here. Okay, so nothing happened. So what you can, basically, every single conversation like we talked about begins with empty token window and goes until the end. The moment I do new conversation or a new chat, everything gets wiped clean.</p><p>But ChatGPT does have an ability to save information from chat to chat, but it has to be invoked. So sometimes ChatGPT will trigger it automatically, but sometimes you have to ask for it. So basically, say something along the lines of, "Can you please remember this?" Or like, "Remember my preference," or whatever, something like that.</p><p>So what I'm looking for is, I think it's going to work. There we go. So you see this memory updated, believes that late 1990s and early 2000s was the greatest peak of Hollywood, et cetera. Yeah. And then it also went on a bit about 1970. And then it allows you to manage memories.</p><p>So we'll look into that in a second. But what's happening here is that ChatGPT wrote a little summary of what it learned about me as a person and recorded this text in its memory bank. And a memory bank is basically a separate piece of ChatGPT that is kind of like a database of knowledge about you.</p><p>And this database of knowledge is always prepended to all the conversations so that the model has access to it. And so I actually really like this because every now and then the memory updates whatever you have conversations with ChatGPT. And if you just let this run and you just use ChatGPT naturally, then over time, it really gets to know you to some extent.</p><p>And it will start to make references to the stuff that's in the memory. And so when this feature was announced, I wasn't 100% sure if this was going to be helpful or not. But I think I'm definitely coming around. And I've used this in a bunch of ways. And I definitely feel like ChatGPT is knowing me a little bit better over time and is being a bit more relevant to me.</p><p>And it's all happening just by sort of natural interaction and over time through this memory feature. So sometimes it will trigger it explicitly. And sometimes you have to ask for it. Okay, now I thought I was going to show you some of the memories and how to manage them.</p><p>But actually, I just looked and it's a little too personal, honestly. So it's just a database, it's a list of little text strings, those text strings, just make it to the beginning. And you can edit the memories, which I really like. And you can, you know, add memories, delete memories, manage your memories database.</p><p>So that's incredible. I will also mention that I think the memory feature is unique to ChatGPT. I think that other LLMs currently do not have this feature. And I will also say that, for example, ChatGPT is very good at movie recommendations. And so I actually think that having this in its memory will help it create better movie recommendations for me.</p><p>So that's pretty cool. The next thing I wanted to briefly show is custom instructions. So you can, to a very large extent, modify your ChatGPT and how you like it to speak to you. And so I quite appreciate that as well. You can come to settings, customize ChatGPT. And you see here, it says, what traits should ChatGPT have?</p><p>And I just kind of like told it, just don't be like an HR business partner, just talk to me normally. And also just give me, I just love explanations, educations, insights, et cetera. So be educational whenever you can. And you can just probably type anything here and you can experiment with that a little bit.</p><p>And then I also experimented here with telling it my identity. I'm just experimenting with this, et cetera. And I'm also learning Korean. And so here I'm kind of telling it that when it's giving me Korean, it should use this tone of formality. Otherwise, sometimes, or this is like a good default setting.</p><p>Because otherwise, sometimes it might give me the informal or it might give me the way too formal and sort of tone. And I just want this tone by default. So that's an example of something I added. And so anything you want to modify about ChatGPT globally between conversations, you would kind of put it here into your custom instructions.</p><p>And so I quite welcome this. And this, I think you can do with many other LLMs as well. So look for it somewhere in the settings. Okay. And the last feature I wanted to cover is custom GPTs, which I use once in a while. And I like to use them specifically for language learning the most.</p><p>So let me give you an example of how I use these. So let me first show you maybe, they show up on the left here. So let me show you this one, for example, Korean Detailed Translator. So no, sorry, I want to start with this one, Korean Vocabulary Extractor.</p><p>So basically, the idea here is I give it, this is a custom GPT, I give it a sentence, and it extracts vocabulary in dictionary form. So here, for example, given this sentence, this is the vocabulary. And notice that it's in the format of Korean, semicolon, English. And this can be copy pasted into Anki flashcards app.</p><p>And basically, this kind of, this means that it's very easy to turn a sentence into flashcards. And now the way this works is basically, if we just go under the hood, and we go to edit GPT, you can see that you're just kind of like, this is all just done via prompting.</p><p>Nothing special is happening here. The important thing here is instructions. So when I pop this open, I just kind of explain a little bit of, okay, background information, I'm learning Korean, I'm beginner, instructions. I will give you a piece of text, and I want you to extract the vocabulary.</p><p>And then I give it some example output. And basically, I'm being detailed. And when I give instructions to LLMs, I always like to number one, give it sort of the description, but then also give it examples. So I like to give concrete examples. And so here are four concrete examples.</p><p>And so what I'm doing here really is I'm constructing what's called a few shot prompt. So I'm not just describing a task, which is kind of like asking for performance in a zero shot manner, just like do it without examples. I'm giving it a few examples. And this is now a few shot prompt.</p><p>And I find that this always increases the accuracy of LLMs. So kind of, that's a, I think, a general good strategy. And so then when you update and save this LLM, then just given a single sentence, it does that task. And so notice that there's nothing new and special going on.</p><p>All I'm doing is I'm saving myself a little bit of work, because I don't have to basically start from scratch, and then describe the whole setup in detail. I don't have to tell ChachiPT all of this each time. And so what this feature really is, is that it's just saving you prompting time.</p><p>If there's a certain prompt that you keep reusing, then instead of reusing that prompt and copy pasting it over and over again, just create a custom Chachi, custom GPT, save that prompt a single time. And then what's changing per sort of use of it is the different sentence. So if I give it a sentence, it always performs this task.</p><p>And so this is helpful if there are certain prompts or certain tasks that you always reuse. The next example that I think transfers to every other language would be basic translation. So as an example, I have this sentence in Korean, and I want to know what it means. Now many people will go to just Google Translate or something like that.</p><p>Now famously, Google Translate is not very good with Korean. So a lot of people use Naver or Papago and so on. So if you put that here, it kind of gives you a translation. Now, these translations often are okay as a translation. But I don't actually really understand how this sentence goes to this translation.</p><p>Like where are the pieces I need to like I want to know more and I want to be able to ask clarifying questions and so on. And so here it kind of breaks it up a little bit, but it's just like not as good because a bunch of it gets omitted, right?</p><p>And those are usually particles and so on. So I basically built a much better translator in Chachi, PT, and I think it works significantly better. So I have a Korean detailed translator. And when I put that same sentence here, I get what I think is a much, much better translation.</p><p>So it's three in the afternoon now, and I want to go to my favorite cafe. And this is how it breaks up. And I can see exactly how all the pieces of it translate part by part into English. So chigumin, afternoon, etc. So all of this. And what's really beautiful about this is not only can I see all the little detail of it, but I can ask clarifying questions.</p><p>Right here. And we can just follow up and continue the conversation. So this is, I think, significantly better, significantly better in translation than anything else you can get. And if you're learning different language, I would not use a different translator other than Chachi, PT. It understands a ton of nuance.</p><p>It understands slang. It's extremely good. And I don't know why translators even exist at this point. And I think GPT is just so much better. Okay. And so the way this works, if we go to here is if we edit this GPT, just so we can see briefly, then these are the instructions that I gave it, you'll be giving a sentence a Korean, your task is to translate the whole sentence into English first, and then break up the entire translation in detail.</p><p>And so here, again, I'm creating a few shot prompt. And so here's how I kind of gave it the examples because they're a bit more extended. So I used kind of like an XML like language, just so that the model understands that the example one begins here and ends here.</p><p>And I'm using XML kind of tags. And so here's the input, I gave it, and here's the desired output. And so I just give it a few examples, and I kind of like specify them in detail. And then I have a few more instructions here. I think this is actually very similar to human, how you might teach a human a task, like you can explain in words what they're supposed to be doing.</p><p>But it's so much better if you show them by example, how to perform the task. And humans, I think, can also learn in a few shot manner significantly more efficiently. And so you can program this in whatever way you like. And then you get a custom translator that is designed just for you, and is a lot better than what you would find on the internet.</p><p>And empirically, I find that ChachiPT is quite good at translation, especially for like a basic beginner like me right now. Okay, maybe the last one that I'll show you just because I think it ties a bunch of functionality together is as follows. Sometimes I'm, for example, watching some Korean content.</p><p>And here we see we have the subtitles, but the subtitles are baked into video, into the pixels. So I don't have direct access to the subtitles. And so what I can do here is I can just screenshot this. And this is a scene between Jinyoung and Seulgi in Singles Inferno.</p><p>So I can just take it, and I can paste it here. And then this custom GPT I called KoreanCAP, first OCRs it, then it translates it, and then it breaks it down. And so basically it does that. And then I can continue watching, and anytime I need help, I will copy-paste the screenshot here, and this will basically do that translation.</p><p>And if we look at it under the hood, in Edit GPT, you'll see that in the instructions, it just simply gives out, it just breaks down the instructions. So you'll be given an image crop from a TV show, Singles Inferno, but you can change this, of course. And it shows a tiny piece of dialogue.</p><p>So I'm giving the model sort of a heads up and a context for what's happening. And these are the instructions. So first OCR it, then translate it, and then break it down. And then you can do whatever format you like. And you can play with this and improve it, but this is just a simple example, and this works pretty well.</p><p>So yeah, these are the kinds of custom GPTs that I've built for myself. A lot of them have to do with language learning, and the way you create these is you come here, and you click My GPTs, and you basically create a GPT, and you can configure it arbitrarily here.</p><p>And as far as I know, GPTs are fairly unique to ChatGPT, but I think some of the other LLM apps probably have a similar kind of functionality, so you may want to look for it in the project settings. Okay, so I could go on and on about covering all the different features that are available in ChatGPT and so on, but I think this is a good introduction and a good bird's-eye view of what's available right now, what people are introducing, and what to look out for.</p><p>So in summary, there is a rapidly growing, changing, and shifting, and thriving ecosystem of LLM apps like ChatGPT. ChatGPT is the first and the incumbent, and it's probably the most feature-rich out of all of them, but all of the other ones are very rapidly growing and becoming either reaching feature parity or even overcoming ChatGPT in some specific cases.</p><p>As an example, ChatGPT now has internet search, but I still go to Perplexity, because Perplexity was doing search for a while, and I think their models are quite good. Also, if I want to kind of prototype some simple web apps, and I want to create diagrams and stuff like that, I really like Cloud Artifacts, which is not a feature of ChatGPT.</p><p>If I just want to talk to a model, then I think ChatGPT Advanced Voice is quite nice today, and if it's being too cagey with you, then you can switch to Grok, things like that. So basically, all the different apps have some strengths and weaknesses, but I think ChatGPT by far is a very good default and the incumbent and most feature-rich.</p><p>Okay, what are some of the things that we are keeping track of when we're thinking about these apps and between their features? So the first thing to realize, and that we looked at, is you're talking basically to a zip file. Be aware of what pricing tier you're at, and depending on the pricing tier, which model you are using.</p><p>If you are using a model that is very large, that model is going to have basically a lot of world knowledge, and it's going to be able to answer complex questions, it's going to have very good writing, it's going to be a lot more creative in its writing, and so on.</p><p>If the model is very small, then probably it's not going to be as creative, it has a lot less world knowledge, and it will make mistakes. For example, it might hallucinate. On top of that, a lot of people are very interested in these models that are thinking and trained with reinforcement learning, and this is the latest frontier in research today.</p><p>So in particular, we saw that this is very useful and gives additional accuracy in problems like math, code, and reasoning. So try without reasoning first, and if your model is not solving that kind of a problem, try to switch to a reasoning model and look for that in the user interface.</p><p>On top of that, then we saw that we are rapidly giving the models a lot more tools. So as an example, we can give them an internet search. So if you're talking about some fresh information or knowledge that is probably not in the zip file, then you actually want to use an internet search tool, and not all of these apps have it.</p><p>In addition, you may want to give it access to a Python interpreter so that it can write programs. So for example, if you want to generate figures or plots and show them, you may want to use something like advanced data analysis. If you're prototyping some kind of a web app, you might want to use artifacts, or if you are generating diagrams, because it's right there and in line inside the app.</p><p>Or if you're programming professionally, you may want to turn to a different app like Cursor and Composer. On top of all this, there's a layer of multi-modality that is rapidly becoming more mature as well, and that you may want to keep track of. So we were talking about both the input and the output of all the different modalities, not just text, but also audio, images, and video.</p><p>And we talked about the fact that some of these modalities can be sort of handled natively inside the language model. Sometimes these models are called omni-models or multi-modal models, so they can be handled natively by the language model, which is going to be a lot more powerful, or they can be tacked on as a separate model that communicates with the main model through text or something like that.</p><p>So that's a distinction to also sometimes keep track of. And on top of all this, we also talked about quality of life features. So for example, file uploads, memory features, instructions, GPTs, and all this kind of stuff. And maybe the last sort of piece that we saw is that all of these apps have usually a web kind of interface that you can go to on your laptop, or also a mobile app available on your phone.</p><p>And we saw that many of these features might be available on the app in the browser, but not on the phone, and vice versa. So that's also something to keep track of. So all of this is a little bit of a zoo. It's a little bit crazy, but these are the kinds of features that exist that you may want to be looking for when you're working across all of these different apps.</p><p>And you probably have your own favorite in terms of personality or capability or something like that, but these are some of the things that you want to be thinking about and looking for and experimenting with over time. So I think that's a pretty good intro for now. Thank you for watching.</p><p>I hope my examples were interesting or helpful to you, and I will see you next time.</p></div></div></body></html>
