Right. I, I, I luckily had someone at the times who was helping me and she would send me like a really great, like one pager of like, here's what you need to know about currency and here's what you need to know about, you know, public transportation.</p><p>And here's like the top 10 things to do when you Google the place, right? Like these are the big tourist hits or whatever. I would try to like knock out those 10 things in like an afternoon and be like, okay, so I've done the brass tacks. I've seen that now, like, let me actually have an experience.</p><p>You know, and I think that goes back to this idea of like travel being more serendipitous, more spontaneous, more connective than it is extractive. I think a lot of the times we think of travel as extractive where it's like, I need to go in there, get things that make me fulfilled and leave and that's and wash my hands of it and plan the next trip.</p><p>And I think leaving things open has always led to the best experiences.</p></div></div></body></html>
