I was in Northern Ethiopia once, and somebody came up to me in a $5 a night hotel room lobby and said, "Hey, you're the charity water guy. "We've heard of you. "Let me tell you a story." The women in my village, they used to all walk eight hours a day.</p><p>And he goes, "There was this one woman, "and at the end of one of her walks, "before she got home, she slipped and she fell, "and all the water that she had just walked for "spilled out into the ground. "And she had this clay pot on her back, "and the clay pot shattered, "and there were shards all over the path." And he said, "She didn't go get another pot.</p><p>"She didn't go back and go refill the water." He said, "She took a rope, and she climbed a tree, "and she tied a noose around her neck, and she hung herself. "It's in the center of my village, "and we found her body swinging from a tree." And what I didn't know until I lived in this village was that she was 13 years old when she died.</p><p>There's statistics, and then there is the story of a real life person who's just one of those 703 million people.</p></div></div></body></html>
