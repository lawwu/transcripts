I don't like doing that because there are a lot of credit card companies that send elevated offers that I want to be able to get access to. What I did notice looking through my own report, which I did pull, is that it does have some of my personal information, a few inquiries from credit union accounts mostly, and then a ton of requests and inquiries from TransUnion slash Credit Karma.</p><p>I think Credit Karma is just querying all the things they have access to query to get as much data about you as they can. It makes me wonder if I should delete my Credit Karma account, but I have not. They do give you a score. The score took me an extra day from the actual disclosure report.</p><p>I got a score of 682. I didn't have a lot of context on that. They said it ranges from 100 to 899 with higher score, meaning lower risk. I guess I am not at any of the cutoffs for risky bank account user, which hopefully makes sense. I don't think I've been doing anything crazy.</p></div></div></body></html>
