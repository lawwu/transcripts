So firstly, let's start with what are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the problems with chat-based systems. When I interact with Claude or OpenAI, it all seems very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">informal. I end up often creating workflows for myself using projects or just copy-pasting stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that way, when I'm kind of having these long conversations that I populate the context window,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I realize that a lot of these things in the context window are just like gibberish and garbage. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we get context pollution. I also don't get to iterate in a structured manner. If I'm working with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">artifacts, it ends up that I basically make the context window dirty enough with not being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, change one sentence that I really wanted to make sure that it's precise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I also sometimes lack another level of forced clarity. ChatGPT often asks me that one particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">question around, "Oh, in deep research, what would you like to actually find?" But it never actually asks me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in the right way when it's not actually certain about some things and therefore not forcing me to clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, there's a couple more issues about poor version control, limited reusability, model laziness. The more the context grows, the less,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">less, you know, the worst response I'm getting. Also, chat interfaces don't support any logical grouping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or nesting in any way. And we also are interacting with a single abstraction layer. We don't get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">see and choose whether we want to specify every small detail of a particular task or just set it up in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">some way. Hence documents. Documents are actually the original way of specifying more complex systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The first product requirements doc that dates probably to Noah's Ark around three and a half thousand years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't check me on that one, however. And it's the first kind of take on someone explaining a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">complex system to somebody who is not aware of how to build it. And therefore, documents are actually the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimate way of humans communicating these more complex ideas. And so in that way, we get forced clarity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity, which is great. But next problem with chat and one of the biggest problems with chat is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">concurrency. We have concurrency of one with all chat-based systems. We need to be sitting there and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we are getting like the inklings of how the future will look like when Manus or Deep Research are running in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the background and actually doing things for us. It feels great. It feels great that there's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in the background that's happening. So now let's riff off this idea of the background agents that I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to introduce. So we've been doing work and computers have been doing work for us in the background for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">quite a while. And, you know, we've kind of created workflows which are kind of handcrafted. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">think of the Zapier of this world. And then we just barely started to create specialized agents. That basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">means that at some stage it kind of had an if-else statement that was somewhat fuzzy and it made one or two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">decisions. And as we can see on this diagram, when the importance of some workflow is high and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">occurrence is high, we actually end up using handcrafted workflows. We're only now entering an area where the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">general agents are starting to take some decisions. But whenever we have kind of higher importance, we don't let</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that general agents to kind of enter our life. So how can we remedy this? We remedy this by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">introducing a human in the loop. So essentially now with the human in the loop, the agent can do a bunch of work and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">get to approve, reject it, change the way that it's created there and output or even fix its logic entirely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They normally react to some kind of implicit or explicit user intent or trigger. So you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">think of these background agents as being activated by a sent email, send Slack message, maybe your meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That could be an implicit trigger that you had a meeting with a name party and that party with investors and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that could prompt you to update your CRM. And with having a bunch of these ambient agents, you end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">having like having to create protocols of how humans and the AIs communicate between themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that basically means that, you know, both humans can control their agents and its outputs, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">different agents can communicate with each other to educate themselves around, you know, sources of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">An agent, one agent could be communicating with a more general agent around what is in your notion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that way we'll probably start with a prosumer first where a bunch of agents are working in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">background. But very soon that starts to be about an organization and we'll start having organizations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which have their own agents and also external agents. And in that way, we might even get agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which manage other humans, which sounds ridiculous at the beginning, but actually, you know, that could be just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">an agent which creates Jira tickets for all of your engineers. And in that way we basically create the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">graph of the enterprise of the future. I think when I think about these background agents, firstly, kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">working for the prosumer, maybe managing your emails and just making sure that you have more time for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself. I think this idea like so naturally represents a bottom up movement to enterprises,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which will be more slow moving and trying to make sure that all of their agentic tools that these agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">need to be using are verified and have the right authority and they have the right permissions and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">don't mess things up. So as I am thinking about the future of the agent economy, I think that the stochastic mindset</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of like we need to adopt that because we essentially need to lead with leverage over uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If something that you don't fully get how it works closes your clients and delivers on business value,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">99.9% of the time we're not going to care about the fact that we don't understand what's happening in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jom-4Brg6Q&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that 0.1% of the time.
