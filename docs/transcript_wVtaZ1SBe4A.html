On the other hand, you can have millions of refugees come into your country, and if you like them and sympathize with them, then it's all hunky-dory and it's fine.</p><p>Polish policy was also excellent. Ukrainians are allowed to work the day they show up. I mean, just to realize how amazing what they're doing in Poland is, this would be like the U.S. took 33 million refugees in a month. Americans freak out over 10,000. So just to realize how phony and bogus the complaints are, and it really is just a matter of believing and seeing.</p><p>If you think that refugees are bad or that immigrants are bad, you will see bad things happening. And on the other hand, if you're supportive and have a can-do attitude, then you'll say, "Hey, this is completely doable."</p></div></div></body></html>
