Back in March 2020, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we were advising people to use these kinds of masks, partly because that was all that was available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And partly because at that time, they actually worked pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, Omicron is such an airborne virus that they're basically totally useless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I would suggest that the mask mandates we currently have doing nothing at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we all need to be switching to something like this, an N95, or something like this, a KF-94.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There's so many of them around the world now. Unfortunately, our government has completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">failed us by failing to get supply in time, like everything else, rapid tests, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is not a supply problem. That's really a policy problem. But this is what we need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually slow down transmission and get the economy back under control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the difference, Jeremy, with the N95 masks? I mean, I've got the two masks here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">My Channel 10-issued cloth mask and the new N95, which I've been wearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What makes it more effective against Omicron? Yeah, so the first one is with the surgical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">mask. There's big gaps in the side, right? So when I breathe in, that aerosolized particles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like cigarette smoke, which is how it's transmitted, they go straight through the gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And for cloth masks, it's a similar thing, but the gaps are little micro gaps inside the wave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are a couple of key differences. The first is that you'll see when I put this on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no gaps, right? And there's a nice tight fit here. And then the second is that the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff that this is made of, it's called a melt-blown polypropylene. There aren't the gaps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for the aerosol to get through. So they fix the fit problem and the filter problem. And these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they cost like two or three dollars. You can use them as many times as you like until the straps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">start to fail. And they don't require any kind of special handling or teaching. In hospitals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they do. But in the community, they don't. They've been well tested for community use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">many times over, and they still work really pretty well. You know, if we all had one of these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that could actually be enough to stop transmission of this virus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there you go. Look at mine. Mine's already filthy. I've only had it on for an hour this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">morning, all the makeup. I wonder, can you wash these, Jeremy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">No, don't wash them. That won't work. Just put up with the makeup. You know, it's okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you can afford to, you know, get a new one each day, but it's purely a cosmetic thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no medical reason for it. I actually really love these KF-94s that come from Korea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Look how flat they are. They can slip into your purse or into your pocket. And then, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they've got this very strong protective coating. There's so many good options out there now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. You've got one for my kid. She's six. Oh, wow. Effective and affordable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Appreciate your time, Jeremy. Thanks for joining us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hoqZp0aJDY&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no worries. Take care.</span></div></div></body></html>
