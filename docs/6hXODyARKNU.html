And they're saying like, in this situation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd need something you're going after something you're getting after that.

It's the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">having some sort of passion to pursue. They were, they were presenting this in the context of life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not just in the context of work as a necessary component to sort of avoiding all the traps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That can really trap a lot of people these days into a life of resentment or disappointment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted to tackle this a little bit, right? Because you could see this idea as maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">contradicting my book. So good. They can't ignore you, which was arguing against the common Maxim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Follow your passion.

They can't ignore you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the idea as spoken by my doppelganger, doing the rock Johnson, that passion is the key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually escaping a shallow life. Well, here's the thing I believe after listening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to this interview, and I want to clarify this, we're highly aligned on this because what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">rock and Joe Rogan were talking about, what they did not say, if you listen to this interview,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what they did not say was right now, I want you to think really hard today and figure out your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one true passion and then go after it. That's not what they said. What the rock was saying instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is you need to have that. The pursuit of something you're passionate about is going to free you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but he did not say where that pursuit actually came from. He did not say that you identify that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">passion easily. And from the very beginning, and we know that in part, because we can look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">life of Dwayne Johnson himself, and he gets into this in this interview, the haphazardness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or should we say the randomness with which the early stages of his path to where he is today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually unfolded. When he talked about football, that was going to be his thing. Not everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">knows this about Dwayne Johnson, but he was a relatively successful college football player.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a big guy, but he knew at some point he realized that wasn't going to be his ticket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He wasn't quite good enough. And when you play at the high level, you get that sense. He didn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what it would take to succeed at the NFL level, so then he gets into wrestling. But this for a while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is really not a great situation. He talked about wrestling at bars and selling his headshot for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">$5 a piece just to make enough money that he could buy a sandwich. It was a random unfolding of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">things that got him to eventually a point where he pursues his life with a lot of passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So he didn't identify a passion in advance, but lives his life with a lot of passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So what lesson do we extrapolate that from for the rest of us? Well, the idea that I uncover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, is that passion is something that you cultivate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not something that you discover. Passion is not, I do some reflection and I figure out this is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm passionate about. It's something you cultivate. And how do you cultivate it? Well, you cultivate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it with discipline. You cultivate it with curiosity. It's a combination of those two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You're curious, you're engaged in the world and options and what's possible. Through this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">curiosity, you find something like this could be interesting. Let me pursue it with discipline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And through the discipline pursuit is where you learn, is this thing building momentum or is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a dead end? Curiosity plus discipline. And when something starts to click, you up the discipline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you up the intensity. And over time that blossoms into passion. And so we see this in the Rock's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">path. He goes from football into wrestling, the wrestling is not going well. He makes some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">changes, gets involved with WWE and suddenly things are really starting to click. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">gives that full intense discipline, really develops his body, develops himself as someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">able to play characters. And he begins to pursue his life with this particular goal with a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">passion. That passion then is what carried him from that and the movies and all the other things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">he's involved with today. That was a passion that was cultivated from discipline and curiosity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That I think is the lesson probably if we sat them down here. If we got Joe and The Rock,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if they'd accept an invitation, but we should send it out. Hey, Joe and The Rock,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">come on by the Deep Work HQ. Come on into the studio. We'll talk to you. I think they would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">agree with this. And certainly I think Dwayne Johnson would probably agree with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's not about I know in advance what I'm supposed to do. It's about approaching the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that you think might be worth doing with enough discipline that you have the opportunity for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to cultivate and blossom into passion. If that's a possibility. We discover and develop passion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">over time. We don't find it through a short moment of self-reflection. So I really like this idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that the discipline, passion, pursuit of things is critical for the deep life. But nuancing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with you don't get there by starting with the passion.

Yeah, I'm going to check it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I started listening to it yesterday while I was exercising. And that caught my attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know what happens later in the interview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">When he talked about Rogan and the raw coming to the HQ for guests, it reminded me of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Mad Dog always talks about, I mean, he gets a lot of guests, but he puts in calls like Kyle Shan and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Dave Campbell, like some big time NFL coaches.

I don't think The Rock would come,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but you never know. That's like the weird thing about it. You never know like, oh, this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">celebrity turns out to secretly be a fan.

Plus I think he's kind of bored. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he did Ryan's show.

I loved his new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXODyARKNU&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">book.
