That's up to that point, that's where their train data cuts off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're pretty outdated.

Now, LineChain is a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">recent Python library. So most of these models, their train data to cut off is at September 2021.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They have no idea about LineChain. LLM chain is a particular object within that library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If I asked GPT-4, how do I do this? The answer isn't very good. So the answer is that LLM chain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in LineChain is an ambiguous term, lacks context. It could refer to a language model. So it did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">manage to get that, which is kind of cool. It could be a blockchain technology. This is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">answer that I seem to see in GPT models quite a lot, that this is some sort of blockchain technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So assuming that LLM chain refers to a language model and LineChain refers to a blockchain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">technology, then it gives you instructions on how to use it. This is just completely false.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't useful in any way to us whatsoever. So this isn't good. With the approach I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to show you, we will get this answer. To use the LLM chain, LineChain, follow these steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Import necessary libraries. Do this. Create, initialize your LLM. Create a prompt template.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Import the LLM chain. Initialize your LLM chain and then run your LLM chain. That's exactly how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you do it. So what we're going to cover in this video is how to make that happen. So the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">now is, what are we doing? What are we going to do? Now, as I mentioned, large language models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they kind of exist in a vacuum. They don't have any sort of external stimuli to the world. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">just have their own internal memory, which was built during the training of this large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">language model. That is kind of all they have. And it's pretty powerful. I mean, you've seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT, now GPT-4, like the things that they can do is incredible, right? Their general knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of the world is very, very good. It's just not up to date and it's not always reliable. Sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they just make things up. So what we want to do is give the large language model access to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">outside world. Now, how do we do that? Well, we're going to use a few different components here. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">main component is what we call a vector database. We're going to be using what is called the Pine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Cone Vector Database for that. Essentially, you can think of this as within your brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you kind of have your long-term memory somewhere in there. You can think of Pine Cone as your kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of long-term memory storage. The large language model is, I know maybe it's like your short-term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">memory. Maybe it's also like the neocortex, which kind of like runs your brain or performs all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">logical calculations within your brain. That is kind of how we can think of these two components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and how they relate to each other. Then we're also going to, okay, so let's say we take a query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to take this query down here. Typically, we just put that query straight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">into the large language model. Instead, now what we're going to do is we're going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">another large language model that has been built for embeddings. Now, an embedding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you can think of embeddings as kind of like the language of language models. That's kind of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they are. These vectors, they basically create a representation, a numerical representation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of language. It's probably better if I draw that out. You have this embedding model here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Given your query, it's going to map that into essentially what is a vector space. It's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to put it here based on the meaning of that query. We create this vector embedding. Then we take its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">pine cone. In pine cone, we already have many of these vector embeddings that we created beforehand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say this is kind of inside pine cone. There's all of these different vectors everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They all represent a piece of information. What we're doing here is we're taking that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we're putting it in here. We're saying, okay, which are the vectors that are nearest to our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">query vector? Maybe it's this one, this one, and this one. Then we return those. Those three items,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they come out to here. We have our vectors. They are connected to some piece of text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant text to whatever our query is. We then take our query, bring it up here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and we feed it into the large language model alongside these pieces of information that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just retrieved. Now the large language model has a way to, it has some sort of connection to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">outside world in the form of this vector database, which is retrieving relevant information based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a particular query. That's what we're going to implement. I think that's enough for this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">abstract visual for this.

You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can also use just index. But this is kind of more reliable, faster, and so on. And then after you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">connected, you can view your index stats. Now, the first time you run this, you should see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the total vector count is zero, right? Because it's empty. Then, you know, after we've done that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we move on to populating the index. To populate the index, we will do this, right? So, we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to do it in batches of 100. All right? So, we'll create 100 embeddings and add all of those to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Pinecone in a batch of 100. Okay? So, what we're going to do is we loop through our dataset,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">through all of the chunks that we have with this batch size. We find the end of the batch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the initial one should be like zero to 100. Right? We take our metadata information there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We get the IDs from that. We get the text from that. And then what we do is we create our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">embeddings. Now, that should work. But sometimes there are issues, like when you have like a rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">limit error or something along those lines. So, I just had a really simple try except statement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in here to just try again. Okay. Cool. After that, we've got our embeddings. Okay. That's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can move on to so, we clean up our metadata here. So, within our metadata,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we only want the text. Maybe the chunk. I don't think we really even need the chunk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm just putting it in there. And the URL, I think that's important. Like, if we're returning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">results to a user, it can be nice to direct them to where those results are coming from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? It helps a user have trust in whatever you're sort of spitting out, rather than not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing where this information is coming from. Right? And then we add all of that to our vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">index. So, we have our IDs, the embeddings, and the metadata for that batch of 100 items. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">then we just loop through, keep going, keep going, in batches of 100. Right. Once that is all done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we get to move on to what I think is the cool part. Right? So, how do I use the LM chain inline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">chain? I think we can just run this. Okay. And let's have a look at the responses. Now, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is kind of messy. Here we go. So, I'm returning five responses. Now, if you see the first one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">here, this is not that relevant. Okay. The top one that we have here. Okay. Fine. Come on to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">next one. This is talking a little bit about large language models. I don't think it necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">manages LM chain here. Fine. Move on to the next one. Now, we get something. Right? LM combined</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">chains. It's talking about what chains are, why we use them. It talks about the prompt template,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a part of the LM chain. And it talks a little bit more about the LM chain. Right. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the sort of information we want. But, I mean, there's so much information here. Do we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">really want to give all of this to a user? No, I don't think so. Right? We want to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">give this information to a large language model, which is going to use it to give a more concise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and useful answer to the user. So, to do that, we create this sort of format here for our query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So, this is just adding in that information that we got up here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">into our query. And we can have a look at what it looks like. So, augmented query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? It's actually kind of messy. Let me print it. Maybe that will be better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So, you can kind of see, I mean, these are just single lines. It's really messy. But we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">separate each example with like these three dashes and a few new lines. And then we have all this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we ask, we put our query at the end. How do I use the LM chain and line chain? All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That is our new augmented query. We have all this external information from the world. And then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have our query. Before, it was just this. Right? Now, we have all this other information that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">can feed into the model. Right? Now, GPT-4, at least in its current state, is a chat model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? So, we need to use a chat completion endpoint like we would have done with GPT-3.5</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Turbo. And with those, we have kind of like the system message that primes the model. Right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to say you are a QnA bot. You are highly intelligent. That answers your questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">based on the information provided. So, this is important. Based on the information provided by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the user above each question. Right? Now, this information isn't actually provided by the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But as far as our AI bot knows, it is. Because it's coming in through a user prompt. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If the information cannot be found in the information provided by the user,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you truthfully say that I do not know. Okay? I don't know the answer to this. Right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is to try and avoid hallucination where it makes things up. Right? Because we kind of don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">want that. It doesn't fully fix that problem. But it does help a lot. So, we pass in that primer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we pass in our augmented query. We're also going to do this. Actually, let me run this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We're also going to do this here. So, we're going to display the response nicely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with markdown. So, what we'll see with GPT-4 is that it's going to kind of format everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">nicely for us. Which is great. But obviously, just printing it out doesn't look that good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we use this. Okay? And let's run. And we get this. Okay. So, to use the LN chain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">line chain, follow these steps, import necessary classes. I think these all look correct. OpenAI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">temperature 0.9. Now, all this looks pretty good. I'd say the only thing missing is probably that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it is missing the fact that you need to add in your OpenAI API key. But otherwise, this looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect. Right? So, I mean, that's really cool. Okay. That's great. But maybe a question that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">at least I would have is how does this compare to not feeding in all of that extra information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that we got from the vector database? All right. We can try. All right. So, let's do the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">thing again. This time, we're not using the augmented query. We're just using the query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just get I don't know. Right? Because we set that set the system up beforehand with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the system message to not answer and just say I don't know if it doesn't have the information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">contained within the information that we pass within the user prompt. Okay. So, that's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's working. But what if we didn't have the I don't know part? Would it just maybe it could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just answer the question. Maybe we're kind of limiting it here. So, I've added this new system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">message.

Let's try. Okay. Cool. So, LineChain hasn't provided any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">public documentation on LLMChain nor is there a known technology called LLMChain in their library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">To better assist you, could you provide more information or context about LLMChain, LineChain?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Meanwhile, if you are providing to LineChain a blockchain based decentralized AI language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">model, I'm you know, I keep getting this answer from GPT and I have no idea if it's actually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">real thing or it's just like completely made up. I assume it must be because it keeps telling me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this. But yeah, I mean, obviously, this is wrong. This isn't what we're going for. It says here if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you're looking for help with a specific language chain or model in NLP, like this is kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant, but it's not. It clearly doesn't know what we're talking about. It's just making guesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just an example of where we would use this system. As you saw, it's pretty easy to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">set up. There's nothing complicated going on here. We're just kind of calling this API,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">calling this API, and all of a sudden we have this insanely powerful tool that we can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to build really cool things. It's getting stupidly easy to create these sort of systems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that are incredibly powerful. I think it shows there are so many startups that are doing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of thing. But at least for me, what I find most interesting here is that I can take this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I can integrate into some sort of tooling or process that is specific to what I need to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and it can just help me be more productive and help me do things faster. I think that's probably,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">at least for me right now, that's the most exciting bit. Then of course, for anyone working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in the company or any founders working on their startup and so on, these sort of technologies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">are like rocket fuel. Things you can do in such a short amount of time is insane. Anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to leave it there. I hope this video has been interesting and helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ-CTKG2dM&t=1609" target="_blank">00:26:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much for watching, and I will see you again in the next one.
