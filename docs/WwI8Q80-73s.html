Your wife was in a significant wheat thresher accident going forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">She will need a machine to chew for her. I hope otherwise your day is a good one. Zuckerberg out. And then there's a sort of like beaming of light. I mean, he talks like Android. Okay. Enough of that. Um, you get the point, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There's been this drum beat from these AI CEOs that you cannot fathom the impact of the disruption that's coming and it's coming soon. Altman was almost in tears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's looking at what he's created. It's like Oppenheimer looking at the Trinity test and quoting the Barger Dia. He was like, I cannot believe what I've done. Then just a few weeks ago, open AI released GPT five.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you haven't been paying attention, this was a key pivot point in our narrative about this technology. Now, just to put this in the context, it had been over two years since open AI's last major model release, which was GPT four. So expectations for GPT five were sky high. Altman had been bragging about this model almost immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Immediately after GPT four is power was first understood. This was going to be the next big leap that got us ever closer to the types of AI impacts of the tech CEOs. We're talking about there, but then people actually got their hands on this demo. When it released a few weeks ago on a Friday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And while they weren't exactly dancing in the streets or running towards their terminator style bunkers. One of the first reviewers to go live with a take on GPT five was a YouTuber named Mr. Who's the boss? Because you know, of course that's his name. He's a YouTuber.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">He had early access to GPT five. So we had a review ready to go. And if you watched his review, this was the first review I saw after GPT five came out. Here's what he said. He said, look, there's some things that GPT five seems better at than its immediate predecessors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, he did some vibe coding. He asked it to create a chess game with Pokemon as pieces because of course he did. If your name's Mr. Who's the boss, you're making Pokemon chess. Um, and he thought it produced something better than what GPT four mini high had produced. Um, it also produced a better script for his channel than GPT four. Oh, he sort of did these side-by-side comparisons, but also there's other tasks where the old GPT model, the GPT four. Oh, was more successful than the new one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">When he asked GPT five to create a YouTube thumbnail, it was worse than what GPT four. Oh, produced when he asked it to come up with a birthday party invitation. And I'm not making this up, Jesse. It was a birthday party invitation for a grown man. That was star Wars themed. This was not ironic. This was like, obviously this is what we would be doing with AI. Uh, GPT four. Oh, produced a better one than the new GPT five within hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Other users who got their hands on GPT five expressed more. Uh, I would say pointed disappointment. It's pretty fun reading. If you go onto the R chat, GPT subreddit, as I did in the aftermath of this model coming out, one of the posts on there and the aftermath said GPT five is the biggest piece of garbage, even as a paid user in a pre-scheduled, ask me anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I am a Altman and other open AI engineers found themselves on the defensive, basically being grilled by users who are like, what is this? Like it's there's stuff about it. We don't like it's not clearly better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Gary Marcus, who, if you haven't heard this name, you probably will hear it more often because for the last few years, he's been leading the charge to argue that generative AI in general was not going to ever deliver the claims that these tech CEOs were promising. I think he had a good summary of the overall reaction to GPT five. Jesse, can we play this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Gary Marcus, GPT five is just dropped. What are your thoughts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not what people expected or hoped it would be. I keep telling them that it's not going to be what they thought. Um, Kevin Scott a year ago was going around giving talks showing GPT five is a humpback whale compared to GPT four was some smaller creature. And there ain't no humpback whale there. It's better in a bunch of different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Elon Musk's Grok four is actually better on François Cholet's arc AGI two task. You know, it's, it's part of the pack. It's not separated from the pack. And after 32 months of hearing people talk about it, I think it was reasonable to say, Hey, we want to see something, you know, genuinely different here. And it's not there. And it's so late too. Like I remember after the day before Super Bowl 2024, people saying, Hey, it's going to drop tonight. It's going to be so cool after the Super Bowl. Well, here we are 18 months later. And it's, let's be honest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a disappointment GPT five in some sense caused a needle scratch on the hyped up tune. The AI industry has been playing. So was it possible that we were not about to see half of new jobs automated and AGI empowered AIs taking over most of our lives? Were we actually not just a couple of years away from having to negotiate our very existence with super intelligent computers? As GPT five made us realize these hard truths more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">more and more people begin to ask a question that just a few months ago would have been dismissed as absurd. What if this is as good as AI is going to get at least for a while? Now I tackled this question. I looked deeply into it in a recent article that I wrote for the New Yorker that came out a couple of weeks ago. And today I want to provide you a fuller version of what I found working on that article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing is for three years we've had a myth perpetuated about what large language models can do. Effectively anything and nothing. And this myth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">has continued to be perpetuated to the point that now people are saying that companies that are laying people off are replacing them with AI, which just isn't true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's Ed Zitron. He's a technology analyst who hosts the podcast Better Offline. He's also been a bit of a thorn in the side of those most crowing about AI's disruptive impact on the economy. Why do they dislike him? He actually checks the claims they make. And what he finds is often less than flattering. Now if you hear Zitron talk like we just did there, it can induce whiplash. Right? Because what he's saying about AI's actual impact really can seem different than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, the news coverage that we have been reading. So if we want to ask this question, not what is going to happen with AI. That's where the CEOs were saying these astonishing claims. But if we want to ask the question of what is happening already because of AI, Zitron's note there that basically nothing of note really runs a skew of what a lot of media coverage has been recently. Not about the future, but about what's happening now. I want to read you some actual headlines. Jesse, I grabbed the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">These from the last month, maybe the last six weeks. These are real headlines for major publications just in the past month or so. Here's one. Goodbye, $165,000 tech jobs. Student coders seek work at Chipotle. Here's the sub headline of that article. As companies like Amazon and Microsoft lay off workers and embrace AI coding tools, computer science graduates say they're struggling to land tech jobs. Here's another headline. AI is wrecking an already fragile job market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">For college graduates. Here's a third. CEO start saying the quiet part out loud. AI will wipe out jobs. Final headline I want to read here. AI will replace most humans, but then what? Right? So when we look at these headlines, you get this sense. Forget like what might happen in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly, certainly it sounds like the AI technology we have is severely disrupting our current economy. People can't get jobs. There's all these layoffs because of AI tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I asked Ed Zitron about this. I said, okay, what is your take about this coverage we see? Not about the future, but the same that like even right now, we're seeing big impact. So here's what Ed had to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, journalists who should try, I don't know, even once looking at the actual data they're quoting are conflating young people not being able to find work with AI and AI being involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is partly because the CEOs of these companies, when they're laying people off, will say, we're making adjustments for efficiency and we're orienting our company around the power of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And people are conflating that with the idea that someone is being replaced by AI despite the fact that AI is not replacing a damn person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">No numbers, no data, just vibes, baby. We don't need where we're going. We don't need the truth. We just have vibes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think vibe is an interesting word there because if you look closer at these articles, you see a lot of what Ed is saying actually showing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This idea that different things that are not really related are being conflated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll take a job loss number that might be true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll take the fact that AI has tools that are relevant to that industry, which is true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You put these two things together and you have the natural consequence of the reader coming away with the impression the layoffs are because of the AI tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So as I look closer at these articles, I was seeing again and again examples of what Zitron was warning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it seems at first glance that the economy is already feeling large impacts from AI tools, but you don't actually find that evidence in these articles themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember

really disrupting the economy, just useful stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.800</a></span> |

this is not the economy right now is operating in a drastically different way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And to make this even worse, as Zitron has emphasized in his reporting, these models are very, very expensive to run because you're redlining GPUs, which is very expensive in terms of compute and electricity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1064"

models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you overcome that to

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there's a reason why there was so much excitement around the potential for AI, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was not one of these sort of bubble situations where people have an irrational exuberance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">There's actually a very rational reason why we had the level of excitement and investment and commitment to AI that actually happened in the past half decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">To help explain what gave us this excitement, I want to play a clip here from the NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Wong, talking at a conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's hear this audio, Jensen, AI, the industry is chasing and racing to scale artificial intelligence, and the scaling law is a powerful model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an empirical law that has been observed and demonstrated by researchers and industry over several generations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And the scaling law says that the more data you have, the training data that you have, the larger model that you have, and the more compute that you apply to it, therefore, the more effective or the more capable your model will become.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span

important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">He's using this technical term, the scaling law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he's referring to there is a series of equations that came out in a paper that was published in 2020.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Jared Kaplan of OpenAI was the lead author.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Dario Amadei was a co-author.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they said, we're going to systematically measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll choose some performance measures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to systematically measure how well this model does as we make it bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm using the word bigger here broadly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">As Jensen talked about in that video, bigger means as we make the model itself bigger, as we train it on more data, so we make the data set bigger, and as we train it longer, so we make the length of the training bigger as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens when we make it bigger?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's make a model that's, like, 12 to 15 times larger than GPT-3.</span></div><div

trained a model this big before because everyone's like, oh, go slow because you've got to find exactly that point where you're too big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But this paper implied, like, I don't know, this curve looks like it goes up fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If we extrapolate this, man, if

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a factor of 10 larger than the largest existing large language model at the

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a huge deal because you have to understand when people in AI were thinking about having something like artificial general intelligence, like AI that could automate our work and do almost everything a human could do, but better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They imagined this would be a super complicated thing.</span></div><div

these giant data centers, but I don't think this isn't making much better models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2071"

target="_blank">00:34:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So they said, we've got to find something to replace this technique we were doing of just making everything bigger that can give us some sort of improvements, because we need momentum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.040</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need something to keep the momentum going here.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a shift to a new storyline about how AI was going to continue to improve that was different from the original scaling storyline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to return to NVIDIA's Jensen Hong here to explain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going to explain here the strategy they came up with after scaling failed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's play this clip, Jesse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are, in fact, two other scaling laws that has now emerged, and it's somewhat intuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The second scaling law is post-training scaling law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Post-training scaling law uses technology techniques like reinforcement learning, human feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, the AI produces and generates answers based on a human query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The human then, of course, gives it feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's much more complicated than that, but that reinforcement learning system with a fair number of very high-quality prompts causes the AI to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">refine its skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It could fine-tune its skills for particular domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be better at solving math problems, better at reasoning, so on and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's essentially like having a mentor or having a coach give you feedback after you're done going to school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you get tests, you get feedback, you improve yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We also have reinforcement learning AI feedback, and we have synthetic data generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">These techniques are rather akin to, if you will, self-practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know the answer to a particular problem, and you continue to try it until you get it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so an AI could be presented with a very complicated and a difficult problem that is verifiable functionally, and it has an answer that we understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe proving a theorem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe solving a geometry problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these problems would cause the AI to produce answers, and using reinforcement learning, you would learn how to improve itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2216" target="_blank">00:36:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's called

with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to give you two

target="_blank">00:37:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing that we were doing before that gave us GPT-3 and GPT-4 and then failed to give us those other great big leap models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">we can call that pre-training-based scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the type of training they were doing there is called pre-training, and that's what they were scaling up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what the original scaly law says, bigger models, more data, more compute is going to make you better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">What Jensen's talking about is post-training, and what you do here is you take a model that has already been pre-trained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've already done the pre-training, and pre-training is unsupervised.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's where you get a ton of real text, and you chop it off in random places, and you tell the model what word comes right after we chop it off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it guesses, and you know the real word because you chopped off the writing, and then you adjust its weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You do this with, like, all the text on the Internet, and the models get really smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's pre-training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2327"

pre-training, and you said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we're now

world of language models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.420</a></span> | <span

specific tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to take the smarts you already got during pre-training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.140</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It requires you have, like, special post-training data sets, which isn't just text, like, in the pre-training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but you have a question and the right answer, and so you can, like, zap it to get it closer to the right answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You could call it test time compute or inference time compute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, you could think of it as, like, other clever things we can do with the models we already trained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, you could have the model, you know, you could tell it to spend more time thinking on questions that are harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Same model, but you spend more time thinking when the questions are harder, you get a better answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you could say, here's what we're going to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll ask the model a bunch of times to answer the question, and then we'll look at the answers and be like, which one comes up more often?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2438" target="_blank">00:40:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's going to give you better performance, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Or we'll have one model look at your question, and then that model's whole job is just to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what type of model, like, what type of these different models we've tuned up in different ways would be best for answering this question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2453" target="_blank">00:40:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we'll send it to that model, and then we'll get a better answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's also all of these other things that were about not necessarily changing how the models, their definitions or what they learned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but just using them in different ways to try to squeeze more performance out of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have these two different scaling laws, but in my New Yorker article, I call that whole thing post-training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's taking a model you already made smart by pre-training and try to make it use those smarts better for particular things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

<span class="t">If you have these like very specific tests and you have a way to take a model and try to get it better at specific tasks, well, then you can just start making these models better at like whatever the tests were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2583" target="_blank">00:43:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh,

insistently post-training, very nuanced, specific little improvements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was incremental and it was more focused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you could add cool features to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

that's very well suited towards post-training because you have – it's easy to generate a question and know the right answer like does this code compile and work.</span></div><div class="c"><span

on computer programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we got some good jumps there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2633" target="_blank">00:43:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Certain types

practical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But these things could make

target="_blank">00:44:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Things like deep research require these sort of post-compute techniques where you can break down a thing in the – an LLM will break down the task in the multiple steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That's its answer and then another LLM takes each of those steps and does it and then a third LLM looks at the answers and puts it together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So using the LLMs more dynamically could get some cool stuff as

want to do, because the biggest trap with graduate degrees is you want the story to be true that this graduate degree that you want to get is the right thing to do because you want to do that because it's convenient or you like it or it makes sense to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4298" target="_blank">01:11:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So you actually have to go verify and by verify, meaning you really need examples of specific jobs where you have an indication, like from someone who works there that we wouldn't hire you now, but we would be likely to hire you if you had this master's degree from this institution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

snapped up in this particular position at Meta doesn't mean if, you know, you have an online master's degree from, you know, the Coney Island Institute of Computer Science and Roller Coaster Repair that that same job is available to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4335" target="_blank">01:12:15.880</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi, Cal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4673" target="_blank">01:17:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">This is Rina, first-time caller, long-time listener.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4676" target="_blank">01:17:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I absolutely love your work, and it has been so life-changing for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4681" target="_blank">01:18:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So my question is, I know you talk a lot about the overhead tax and how you want to take on less projects at a single time so that the overhead tax is less so that you actually have more time to do the project, and all of that sounds great to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4696" target="_blank">01:18:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">However, the thing that I've been struggling with is the overhead tax that happens after a project is done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4703" target="_blank">01:18:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, I'm a composer, and I write the piece, I finish it up, I turn it into the commissioner, all of that is done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4710" target="_blank">01:18:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But then, even years later, people will be emailing me to be, like, you know, asking questions about the piece and about the interpretation, maybe finding some errors in the piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4720" target="_blank">01:18:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm wondering if you deal with that in any of your books, you know, books that you've written years ago where you're still kind of managing the back end of them, or if anything in your life has this, or if you really feel that when you complete a project, it's completely done, and you never have to deal with the overhead tax again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4738" target="_blank">01:18:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd be so interested on your insights on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4742" target="_blank">01:19:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">A professional composer is cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4744" target="_blank">01:19:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4744" target="_blank">01:19:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you commission pieces, and you compose them.</span></div><div class="c"><span

work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4752" target="_blank">01:19:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4753" target="_blank">01:19:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4756" target="_blank">01:19:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to remind the listener in general what that is, because you should always keep it in mind, is the idea that when you accept something, it brings with it administrative overhead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4763" target="_blank">01:19:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">This is going to be meetings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4766" target="_blank">01:19:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be spacing your thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4767" target="_blank">01:19:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what you have to be worried about, not getting too large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4769" target="_blank">01:19:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why you should not say yes to too many things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4771" target="_blank">01:19:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if the actual total time required to do the things you've said yes to is reasonable, it's possible that all of the overhead tax those things brings with it makes your life unreasonable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4784" target="_blank">01:19:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That to get to the 20 total hours this month it'll take to do these five projects might generate 20 emails a day and six meetings a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4792" target="_blank">01:19:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that just makes your life so fractured that you are completely frustrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4796" target="_blank">01:19:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you have to monitor overhead tax very carefully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4800" target="_blank">01:20:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the main reason why overload, having too much on your plate, is dangerous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4803" target="_blank">01:20:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In your

sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4840" target="_blank">01:20:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but you handle a lot of my

sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4844" target="_blank">01:20:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of stuff comes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4845" target="_blank">01:20:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I see very little of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4846" target="_blank">01:20:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But then it used to be the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4848" target="_blank">01:20:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">When I first started writing books, I was writing books for students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4851" target="_blank">01:20:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I felt like it was just part of my service I was doing to the world was like to help students not be stressed out, not get overwhelmed, have a good experience in college, figure out how to be a meaningful adult and move on to satisfying lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4861" target="_blank">01:21:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I tried to answer every email that people would send in for my initial books, and it took more and more time, and it finally became, it just was not tractable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4869" target="_blank">01:21:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I went through this sort of similar calculus that Neil Stephenson talks about in his sort of classic essay, Why I'm a Bad Correspondent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4876" target="_blank">01:21:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You do the math eventually, and you say, there's enough correspondence coming in now that to try to keep up with all of it would take a sizable portion of my time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4884" target="_blank">01:21:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the raw number of people here is not massive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4888" target="_blank">01:21:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be 100 people a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4889" target="_blank">01:21:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's going to take up a huge amount of my time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4892" target="_blank">01:21:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's enough time now that it is going to significantly slow down my ability to, for example, write a new book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4898" target="_blank">01:21:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I write a good book, even like, not like my really successful new books, but like a good, my student books, like two out of my three student books are comfortably over, I don't know, I don't know what they are, but I think a straight A student sold like 300,000 copies, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4911" target="_blank">01:21:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm never going to answer 300,000 emails, but that reached 300,000 people and brought those ideas to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4917" target="_blank">01:21:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So Neil Stephenson in that famous essay I talked about, he's a sci-fi novelist if you don't know him, a speculative fiction writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4922" target="_blank">01:22:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, look, my book's going to be read by more people than I can talk to directly, so I have to just become a bad correspondent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4930" target="_blank">01:22:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was a meaningful essay to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4932" target="_blank">01:22:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's uncomfortable at first because it feels selfish because you're not used to being a public figure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4939" target="_blank">01:22:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to say, someone's trying to reach out to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4941" target="_blank">01:22:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">In general, if someone's like trying to talk to you, it's rude to ignore them, but you're in a different situation where you're doing creative production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4947" target="_blank">01:22:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if it gets to the point that dealing with what people's questions, good intention, positive questions for you about your work, if that prevents you from doing more work, now you're minimizing your impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4959" target="_blank">01:22:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's better to write that next book that's going to reach a couple hundred thousand people than it is over the next five years to talk to a couple thousand people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4968" target="_blank">01:22:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a different or a couple of different orders of magnitude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4971" target="_blank">01:22:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So eventually, I think if you're doing creative production, you have to just have a hard rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4976" target="_blank">01:22:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I just, I'm not able, I'm not able to do one-on-one interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4981" target="_blank">01:23:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll feel weird at first and then it'll feel better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4983" target="_blank">01:23:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is just, the economics of creative impact say at some point, you have to maybe just have pretty big limits on, this is why like I do this show now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4992" target="_blank">01:23:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a way for me to actually answer questions and try to be useful beyond my books, but still at a much larger scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=4999" target="_blank">01:23:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because like a good episode of this could, you know, hit 80,000 people or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=5003" target="_blank">01:23:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's going to, that's better than answering 80 questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=5007" target="_blank">01:23:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I can answer eight and maybe reach 80,000 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=5009" target="_blank">01:23:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that economics is utilitarian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwI8Q80-73s&t=5011" target="_blank">01:23:31.600</a></span> |
