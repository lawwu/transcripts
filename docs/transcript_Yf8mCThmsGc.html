It's a fundamentally different way of looking at the world. So Putin honestly looks at the world that if I control territory, that's what makes me secure. Maritime powers, they start with Britain, which is, "Hey, mine's secure if I can maximize money from commerce, because then I can buy navy and buy allies with armies and stuff.</p><p>They want to run transactions by law, etc." That this is an international order that's win-win. You join it, you get security, you have input on how it evolves because it's a work in progress. Whereas this continental thing is negative sum. And you can see it in Ukraine. So Putin wants more territory.</p><p>Okay, he's got a zone. He took the eastern Ukraine and he took Crimea in 2014, but it's negative sum because he destroys whatever businesses have been being run in Donbass, and he absolutely kills most of the tourist industry. And then you could look right today, it's so negative sum in Ukraine.</p><p>He is destroying wealth at a really rapid clip. It's really a stupid way to run, too. And if you go up to Taiwan, so if PRC tries to take Taiwan, it's a continental view, more territory, somehow we think it's going to improve our security. No, they'll level it. And they'll hurt themselves.</p><p>Whereas if they just ignore the Taiwan thing and say, "Oh, they're so annoying. Let them run their own place. Who wants them anyway?" And then trade with them, they'll both make money. And so when I look at this, that's my biggest career takeaway, is that if we go through international law and international institutions, and this is not a hedge.</p><p>Political scientists love to talk about, "Ah, America, the hegemon," right? No other country in the world wants an American hegemon. There may be some people in the United States who thinks that looks great, but no one's going to buy into a world order in which the United States is the hegemon who pushes everyone else around.</p><p>I get it, we're big and we're influential. Other people are influential, too. But this maritime order where, yeah, we're an important part of it, but have many other people in it, it's a win-win. And you can look at some with Biden right now, he's doing all of these meetings with Europeans of managing of what's going to go on in Ukraine, etc.</p><p>And it's based on agreement of all these different countries chipping in big and small. And who's prosperous and who's not, may I ask? Yeah, they are. And who are the ones who have massively increased their standards of living since the Cold War? It was really the third world. Except now we got Wagner or whatever's left of it.</p><p>And also China's now got these private military things running roughshod over Africa, which all that's going to do is tank African growth rates, which for a while are going double digit. So that's one of my big career takeaways.</p></div></div></body></html>
