And so for sort of the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">segment or episode in this series, we want to talk about how to respond, how to respond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what do you do with all this online criticism?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I want to get a little personal and just talk about, like, I don't know if this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">is necessarily, like, prescriptive for everybody, but at least for us, like, how have we responded?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we've responded in pretty different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but before we get into that, I mean, I just want to point out that this is not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like a question or issue that, like, we face as a church. Because I think this is just a question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that, like, a bunch of pastors are facing. You know, I think it's pretty clear that pastors have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">had it pretty rough. And I mean, it's not just pastors, but companies, like, everyone seems to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">their share of online criticism. Yeah, there was that recent Barna survey about how 39% of pastors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">are considering quitting ministry. And number, like, I think four reason or something was, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">number three reason was increased criticism. Yeah, yeah. And then, you know, I recently watched this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast between Rick Warren and Kerry Newhoff. You know, he's retired from Saddleback. And one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the big questions is, like, you got a lot of online criticism. How did you handle that? And he had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">really great answer. And we can link that in the show notes. But yeah, there's a little bit out there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">about how to respond. But I think that is a big question mark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Wait, what did he say? We're going to be curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I mean, just in a nutshell. Oh, yeah. In a nutshell, he says, basically, like, he has this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">like, what he says is, oh, that guy said that about me? Well, I have nothing but respect for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">For him. Yeah, for him. Yeah, yeah. And it's like this very, you know, it's this amazing thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that he does. Very gracious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So it's a question that everyone's facing. It's a question that, like, a lot of us have. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">then I think it's a question a lot of people have about grace pointers, like people in grace, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">how are you guys responding? You know, like, do you guys even know? And yes, we do know, right? I hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you can, you know, that's clear. And so, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of within that context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're answering. But yeah, I think we can share how we personally have been responding to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">start there. Yes, I can, I can start. Yeah, you can jump in. Yeah, we have very different responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Very different. I mean, for me, I first kind of stumbled across this, I think, as a senior in high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">school. And back then, as is the case now, but most of it was about my parents, very personal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And so, I mean, just emotionally, it was bewildering. It was, I felt a lot of things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">anger, sadness, fear, this kind of just like a, like this physical, like churning of the stomach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that you experience. And a lot of people say this when they're like the main character for the day on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Twitter or whatever, like you experience this kind of like physiological kind of reaction. I just didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">know what to do with it. You know, I tried responding, you know, under my own name and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people didn't believe it was me. Actually, someone thought it was someone else using me as a pseudonym,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">person. But it took me a while to process that. And I mean, I think, I think at the time, the way I dealt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with that was, okay, like, this is, this is, I guess, the nature of the internet, maybe, or these people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">just don't understand what we're trying to do. And then I think over the years, I mean, that view has gotten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">more like nuanced and there's been kind of other things there, but what about you, Steven? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">when did you first encounter it, if at all? And yeah, well, I mean, honestly, like I just to comment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on what you just said, like, I can't imagine how I responded as a 17 year old. Like, that's just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you're from the cortex, not fully developed, you know, and just like emotions and everything. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">man, I can't imagine. But for me, I think I mentioned this earlier episode, but came across as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">freshman. And I was like, what? Nah, like, this is not my experience. And so I just quickly like brushed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And, and it was interesting, like being at Berkeley and encountering other freshmen who had read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it and kind of getting into like debates with them, actually, just like what, you know, and, and, and really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">defending our church, you know, um, as a gung ho freshman, you know, um, over the years, just didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">really think much about it until like, yeah, actually pretty recently, right before we got sent out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Philly. And there was sort of another big wave of criticism. Yeah. And, um, you know, like it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that one was, that one hit closer to home because it had been so many years and I've been like really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">invested in ministry and, and it was just, everything was just a lot more personal for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I kind of went into a little bit of a tailspin personally. I wasn't like breaking down or anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but it was just sort of really disorienting because, um, yeah, I shared this in a previous episode too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I started thinking about things that I had done and said, and replaying those over and over and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">over and over in my mind. And I ended up kind of in a dark place and it's a kind of talking to you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">following up with some of these guys, um, that I was wondering about, you know, where we were at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in these conversations, all of them still at our church. And, and then it even took me talking to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">someone who had graduated and went home, you know, and, and I had actually, um, for that particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">instance, like, I don't think he would mind me sharing it. Um, but it was basically like, we had had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like a little bit of a tension conflict and it kind of got resolved, but not really. And then he,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and then he, and then he, um, and then he, well, he went under another leader actually for a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">bit and then he went home and he had asked to like basically meet up and just kind of clear the air</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">before he went home. And I was in the middle of like something busy and I let the ball drop and he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really hurt by that. And, and then actually it was, um, it was, he, he didn't bring it up with me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">directly because he was understandably like really hurt. And it was, um, actually, uh, one of, it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it was, uh, I don't want to name any names, but, but it was someone at our church who brought it up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">me.

Right. And I was like, oh man, I messed up. You know, so I reached out to him. And so there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was kind of this long process for me and, um, and I came out of it better, came out of it learning a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and kind of, I think it did a lot of good for me, but where I'm at right now is knowing kind of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">dark I can get and what a place I can get. I just don't read it. I just, it's, I don't, I can't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and, um, it's not because I'm like, la, la, la, la, la, you know, I don't want to know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, it's just, yeah, I'm already a dramatic emotional guy as it is. A lot of high highs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of low, low, a lot of low lows, you know, and it doesn't take much for me to cry or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Cause I don't think that's true. Like, yeah, we make mistakes as leaders. We make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">mistakes.

Sometimes we look back and like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, my motivations were not right there.

It's like, I, I like, I think what I was doing was I was kind of mourning a little bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">actually. And during that emotional tailspin, I was mourning kind of like just the brokenness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in general of the world.

I was mourning just the state of Christianity and the internet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all that stuff. And then I was learning. Right. And, and, and, you know, and then I kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">after that, it was just sort of like, well, I'm going to keep obeying my calling to preach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel and I'm just going to trust and I'm not going to stop that.

Like, this is so weird. And you're much friendlier and nicer than me. But, um, so for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">when I read the, the, the stuff online, actually, my initial reaction is not like inward, like, Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have I done this? Um, it's kind of like, who did this stuff, you know? And I, and I kind of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I, I kind of feel for the posters actually. And for the people who write stuff, like, did this happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what the heck, if this happened, I'm angry, you know, and I want to, and I want to get to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">bottom of this. Yeah. Um, and I mean, not a hundred percent, some of it, some of it I read, I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, that kind of sounded like it was your fault, man. And you know, so it's, it's mixed obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's a fair amount of stuff I read. I'm like, yo, if, if what you're saying is true,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Yeah. You're owed an apology. Yeah. There are times where you've talked about this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And I'm like, who's sad are you? Yeah. A little bit of that. A little bit. And I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I, I'm kind of like that. I kind of err on that direction. I'm sort of like a, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, maybe in another life, I would have been like a social justice warrior or something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm, I'm kind of like, I get up in arms about things. And, um, so like for me, I, I feel for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">people who write this stuff and I do wonder, is this true? Yeah. And I, you know, I've confronted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, my dad a couple of times and just differently than like, Hey, is this true?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, I've also gone onto the Reddit actually. So I kind of took a different approach and I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to engage with people and, and I posted anonymously for a while. And most people have probably figured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">out my handle by now. Um, and it wasn't a long time. I think it was maybe like a month or two where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I was kind of actively posting and trying to talk to people. And a couple of things that I did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I went on there and I said, Hey, if you want to talk, um, if you're looking for reconciliation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want an apology or you think you're owed an apology, please reach out to me. I'm a staff at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Grace Point, you know, for my own reasons, I don't want to reveal my name right now. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but let's talk. And I would love to try and set something up and try to get to the bottom of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Go through the Matthew 18.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And there was, it was interesting. There's a variety of reactions. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">some people were like, wow, I respect that. Thank you. Um, but, um, for the most part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually almost uniformly other than one person, nobody actually took me up on that for various reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people, um, said, you know, like, I just don't want anything to do with Grace Point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not interested in reconciliation anymore, um, which I get. Um, and then some people like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't trust you.

Some people, it's just, they didn't believe that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this would do any good. Like, ah, like, I don't think talking to anyone will just help. I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">cynical about that. And some people are just simply not interested in reconciliation. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not what I'm after. I'm just here to, um, you know, air my grievances and heal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, I mean, I, I guess in that way, I felt like, okay, I tried, I did try to talk to people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, and often when I, when I would read a story, I would go and try to get to the bottom of it. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and, you know, as is the case with most things in life, the answers were complicated, right? It wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">just like one thing. It wasn't like, oh, I uncovered this treasure trove of like dirty secrets. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't like that. Some, sometimes when I talked to the other party involved at, you know, as best I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">can ascertain, cause most of these are anonymous, but you know, when I would talk to people about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it'd be like, that never happened. I don't remember that, which, you know, I, I believe that they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">remember that. Um, some people would, sometimes people would say, oh yeah, you know, that time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I was too much. Yeah. You know, I was too harsh. I really regret that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, and sometimes it was just complicated. It's like, oh, well there's truth to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's more to that story. You know, they would give me other contexts and things. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to get into any details, but, um, I guess all that to say, like, it wasn't neat. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't tidy. Right. Um, and I don't know. I, I feel like also, I think my experience of doing this also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">was that it was really hard to have any like nuanced discussion. Hmm. Cause I'm, I, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to fake it, you know, I'm not going to go on here and just say, oh man, you're totally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right.

You should just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">apologize. Right. Like I told me that. And at the end of the day, it just felt like there was no interest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in like actual discussing discussion.

And I don't deny that that's the case. Cause I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously these emotions are real, right?

Then you're part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the problem. Yeah. It's kind of like a guilty until proven innocent. Yeah. Like that, that's how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it felt. And I mean, so I came away from that period and eventually I just stopped. Cause kind of like you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it started to put me in a dark place and you know, my wife was saying, man, you're, you're just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're getting dark because of this. I pulled out of that and I stopped. And I think my takeaway</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are like, it's just hard.

There's just so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">complicating factors. Not everyone agrees. So it's not like there's one official list of grievances</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">against grace point on there or anything. Yeah. Um, there's contradictions. Yeah. People,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">people say one thing, another, another group says another thing.

There's no desire to really talk civilly. Um, and so again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like have we done wrong? Yes, for sure. Like we've made mistakes. I feel like in my experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been treated unfairly or overly harshly by a leader. So it's not like I'm pretending that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">never happens for sure. It's just that I personally don't see a way just given kind of the way things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are in the online world. I don't see a way to fix that personally. Like I tried, I mean, I'm just one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">person obviously, but it just felt very like it didn't, it didn't move the needle at all. It didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">help. Like there was no progress towards reconciliation. And, um, I, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so, so given that like kind of experience and you're just kind of that, that was your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">takeaway meant like, where are you right now?

You know, so if you were to just kind of, um, I think, I think what I've concluded is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to, I want, I want to be blameless in the sense of like, Hey, I'm going to put myself out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">here. If you want to talk, if you were interested in reconciliation, here's how to do it. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I want to have that avenue always open. I want to keep that door always open. But I kind of do think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">well, the ball is on the aggrieved person's court to speak up because they're the anonymous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">ones. We don't know who they are. Right. In the case of non anonymous ones, maybe a little different,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but for the most part, they're anonymous. Right. And once that door is there and people know it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there, then I just have to move forward and keep serving God, you know, and I need to pray for my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">enemies. Cause that's what Jesus commands. I need to continue to love them, but I need to move forward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and keep on serving God because life is just a lot bigger than the mistakes we've made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">life is just a lot bigger than what's on the internet. And there's a lot of people out there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">who don't know Jesus and need me and need other Christians to go and tell them about God's love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQ_aB8OhPE&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, I can't, I can't solve other people's problems for them.
