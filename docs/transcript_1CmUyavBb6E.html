Tell us a story. - You gotta tell him, you know, when he, this is true, he pulled up to the UT, the rival of A&M.</p><p>Didn't you pull up to the UT frat house? - That's a good one. - That is the best, that is the funniest thing of all time. - That's a really good one. So, a lot of my boys, you know, and me growing up, I was a huge Texas fan, I wanted to go to UT.</p><p>A lot of my best friends from high school went to UT. So, 'cause I redshirted my first year, and they have their spring parties going on, they're a bunch of Kappa Sigs, and SAEs, and different fraternities. So I went down for a weekend for their big parties. - The rival college.</p><p>- And had the best time ever, but I'm a redshirt. Nobody really knows who I am. Like, I played against a guy named Malcolm Brown in high school, was an unbelievable running back. Like, guys who I had known and competed against went to Texas. So, you know, we were still good dogs.</p><p>Played unbelievable battles against each other in high school. And like, went, had the best time ever, rocked it, slept on the floor of the fucking SAE house, and it was sick. Like, I start that year, go play, win the Heisman. The next spring comes around. I'm like, we're fucking doing Fiji Island again, duh.</p><p>- Yeah. - We're like going to the mall before the game. My boy buys a fucking Aaron Hernandez jersey. I buy a Tim Tebow jersey, 'cause I thought it would be fucking hilarious to go party and drink a thousand beers in a Jets Tim Tebow jersey. And I walk into this party, and, fuck, man.</p><p>They have a bunch of floaty, like, pools and, like, hay bales around it. And it's like a foam party and stuff. And, you know, I'm sitting on one of the hay bales. I'm talking with my boys who play at UT. And this fucking guy walks by me, and he fucking bumps me.</p><p>And I, like, fucking fall and, like, put one foot into the pool. And I kind of walk by, and I, like, let it slide. I'm like, fuck it, whatever. My shoe's fucking soaked. I'm getting a little pissed. And then the fucking guy comes back, bro, and hits me with a fucking shoulder check again.</p><p>This time, both feet in the water. And I sit there for a minute, and the guy, like, walks around all the hay bales, and he's going to the other side. And I just walk through every one of these pools. Just fucking walk right across, bro. And he's walking like this.</p><p>And I just fucking crow hop, and boom! Fucking knock him out, bro. His arms go fucking stiff, and he falls into the fucking floaty pool. And I'm like-- and I just walk straight out the door. Damn. So then I think it was, like, the next year, I go back to the same party.</p><p>This guy's, of course, in the same fucking fret, dude. And I walk in, and I'm there for maybe, like, 30 minutes. And you start to hear a little whispers. They're starting to fucking gang up and shit. And they're like, yo, you need to get the fuck out of here.</p><p>I'm like, what? You need to get the fuck out of here. And they're all standing up on the balcony, and they're loaded up with fucking beers. And they just start making it fucking rain at me, throwing it. I, like, have two of my boys. They, like, put my arm around them.</p><p>We walk out, like, walk out into the street. And then 20 dudes come out. And I'm with four of my boys from fucking Kerrville. And it was one of those moments where they kind of, like, surround you. And we're all back-to-back against each other. And we're like, we fucking-- let's get it fucking popping.</p><p>Let's go. This is what it's all about. We, like, fucking-- we're squaring up, like, waiting for somebody to do something. And finally, like, nothing really happened. And we just walk down the street and go back to our own frat house. And, like, that was the end of the story.</p><p>But I wake up the next day on TMZ, you know, fucking beers raining down, walking out of the fucking frat house. Like, just all kinds of fucking shit started. Like, Manziel partying in a fucking Tebow jersey. And then my boy has his fucking sunglasses hanging down on his nose.</p><p>He's in an Aaron Hernandez jersey, and he's just so fucked up. And everybody called him sunglass shithead for, like, the rest of his life. And it went fucking viral forever.</p></div></div></body></html>
