This is the number of times Apple was mentioned. He went from basically saying Apple was the absolute end all and be all and it's gone from basically a bunch of times to almost none.</p><p>What's interesting about that is the last time that that happened was with drumroll Wells Fargo over 15 and 20 years Buffett built up a huge position until he realized that that company was not really one of his forever stocks. And the number of times it was mentioned in his letter went to zero.</p><p>So I think this Buffett index is a really important one for Apple, which is it went from a forever holding that he said he would own forever to barely getting mentioned. Unfortunately, it speaks for a very bad next five to 10 years for this company, unless they figure something out.</p></div></div></body></html>
