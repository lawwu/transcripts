Before we do, a reminder that we have these two really important topics on the forums.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're pinned at the top of the forum category. One is Fact Resources and Official Course Updates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where, if there's something useful for you to know during the course, we will post there. Nobody else can reply to that thread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you set that thread to Watching and to Notifications, you're not going to be bugged by anybody else except stuff that we think you need to know for the course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's got all the official information about how to get set up on each platform. Please note, a lot of people post all kinds of other tidbits about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how they've set up things on previous solutions or previous courses or other places. I don't recommend you use those because these are the ones that we're testing every day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that the folks involved in these platforms are testing every day and they definitely work. So I would strongly suggest you follow those tips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you do have a question about using one of these platforms, please use these discussions, not some other topic that you create.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because this way, people that are involved in these platforms will be able to see it and things won't get messy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then secondly, for every lesson there will be an official updates thread for that lesson. So Lesson 1, official updates, and the same thing. Only FastAI people will be posting to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can watch it safely and we'll have all the things like the videos, the notebooks, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're all wiki threads, so you can help us to make them better as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I mentioned the idea of watching a thread. So this is a really good idea, is that you can go to a thread, like particularly those official update ones, and click at the bottom, "Watching".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you do that, that's going to enable notifications for any updates to that thread. Particularly if you go into, click on your little user name in the top right, "Preferences", and turn this on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That will give you an email as well. So any of you that have missed some of the updates so far, go back and have a look through because we're really trying to make sure that we keep you updated with anything that we think is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing which can be more than a little overwhelming is even now, after just one week, the most popular thread has 1.1000 replies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's an intimidatingly large number. I've actually read every single one of them, and I know Rachel has, and I know Sylvia has, and I think Francisco has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you shouldn't need to. What you should do is click "Summarize this topic" and it'll appear like this, which is all of the most liked ones will appear, and then there'll be "View 31 hidden replies" or whatever in between.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how you navigate these giant topics. That's also why it's important you click the "Like" button, because that's the thing that's going to cause people to see it in this recommended view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you come back to work, hopefully you've realized by now that on the official course website, course-v3.fast.ai, you will click "Returning to Work". You will click the name of the platform you're using, and you will then follow the two steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Step one will be how to make sure that you've got the latest notebooks, and step two will be how to make sure you've got the latest Python library software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They all look pretty much like this, but they're slightly different from platform to platform, so please don't use some different set of commands you read somewhere else. Only use the commands that you read about here, and that will make everything very smooth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If things aren't working for you, if you get into some kind of messy situation, which we all do, and just delete your instance and start again, unless you've got mission-critical stuff there, it's the easiest way just to get out of a sticky situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you follow the instructions here, you really should find it works fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is what I really wanted to talk about, most of all, is what people have been doing this week. If you've noticed, and a lot of you have, there's been 167 people sharing their work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really cool, because it's pretty intimidating to put yourself out there and say like, "I'm new to all this, but here's what I've done."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so examples of things I thought was really interesting was figuring out who's talking. Is it Ben Affleck or Joe Rogan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought this is really interesting. This is actually very practical. I wanted to clean up my WhatsApp downloaded images to get rid of memes, so I actually built a little neural network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, how cool is that to say like, "Oh yeah, I've got something that cleans up my WhatsApp. It's a deep learning application I wrote last week."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why not? Like, it's so easy now. You can do stuff like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's been some really interesting projects. One was looking at the sound data that was used in this paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this paper, they were trying to figure out what kind of sound things were, and they got, as you would expect since they published a paper, they got a state of the art of nearly 80% accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ethan Sooten then tried using the Lesson 1 techniques and got 80.5% accuracy. So I think this is pretty awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Best as we know, it's a new state of the art for this problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe somebody since then has published something. We haven't found it yet. They take all of these with a slight grain of salt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I've mentioned them on Twitter, and lots of people on Twitter follow me, so if everybody knew that there was a much better approach, I'm sure somebody would have said so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This one is pretty cool. Survash has a new state of the art accuracy for Devangari text recognition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he's got it even higher than this now. And this is actually confirmed by the person on Twitter who created the dataset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think he had any idea. He just posted, "Hey, here's a nice thing I did."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this guy on Twitter was like, "Oh, I made that dataset. Congratulations. You've got a new record." So that was pretty cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I really like this post from Alina Harley. She describes in quite a bit of detail about the issue of them metastasizing cancers and the use of point mutations and why that's a challenging important problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And she's got some nice pictures describing what she wants to do with this and how she can go about turning this into pictures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, see, this is the cool trick, right? It's the same with this sounds one, turning sounds into pictures and then using the Lesson 1 approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here it's turning point mutations into pictures and then using the Lesson 1 approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what did she find? It seems that she's got a new state of the art result by more than 30%, beating the previous best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody on Twitter who's a VP at a genomics analysis company looked at this as well and thought it looked to be a state of the art in this particular point mutation one as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's pretty exciting. So you can see when we talked about last week this idea that this simple process is something which can take you a long way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It really can. I will mention that something like this one in particular is using a lot of domain expertise, like it's figuring out what picture to create.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't know how to do that because I don't even really know what a point mutation is, let alone how to create something that visually is meaningful that a CNN could recognize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the actual big learning side is actually pretty straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another very cool result from Simon Willison and Natalie Down, they created a Cougar or not web application over the weekend and won the Science HAC Day Award in San Francisco.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that's pretty fantastic. So lots of examples of people doing really interesting work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully this will be inspiring to you to think, wow, this is cool that I can do this with what I've learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It can also be intimidating to think like, wow, these people are doing amazing things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's important to realize out of the thousands of people doing this course, you know, I'm just picking out a few of the really amazing ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, Simon is one of these very annoying people like Christine Payne, who we talked about last week, who seems to be good at everything he does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He created Django, one of the world's most popular web frameworks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He founded a very successful startup and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, one of these really annoying people who tends to keep being good at things, now it turns out he's good at deep learning as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, that's fine. Simon can go and win a hackathon on his first week of playing with deep learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe it'll take you two weeks to win your first hackathon. That's okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think like it's important to mention this because there was this really inspiring blog post this week from James Dellinger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who talked about how he created a bird classifier using the techniques from lesson one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I really found interesting was at the end, he said he nearly didn't start on deep learning at all because he went to the scikit-learn website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is one of the most important libraries of Python, and he saw this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he described in this blog post how he was just like, "That's not something I can do. That's not something I understand."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this kind of realization of like, "Oh, I can do useful things without reading the Greek."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought that was a really cool message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really want to highlight, actually, Daniel Armstrong on the forum, I think really shows, is a great role model here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which was here saying, "I want to contribute to the library."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I looked at the docs, and I just found it overwhelming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And his next message one day later was, "I don't know what any of this is. I didn't know how much there was to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It caught me off guard. My brain shut down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I love the way it forces me to learn so much."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then one day later, I just submitted my first pull request.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's awesome. It's okay to feel intimidated. There's a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But just pick one piece and dig into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Try and push a piece of code or a documentation update, or create a classifier, or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's lots of cool classifiers people have built. It's been really, really inspiring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Triddedad and Tobago Islander versus Masquerada classifier, a Zucchini versus Cucumber classifier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This one was really nice.

target="_blank">00:13:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so they're kind of like more like spreadsheets and databases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:13:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea here is that it turns out that it's much better for learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you kind of see things multiple times.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:15:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this approach is based on a lot of research,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

soccer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which in our case is to type code and look at the inputs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and look at

our first notebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is called

<span class="t">So it's going to be a lot like last week's pet detector,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it'll detect whatever you like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'll be like some of those examples we just saw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How would you create your own Panama bus detector from scratch?</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are going to try to create a teddy bear detector.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that the thing we're about to cuddle is in fact a genuine teddy

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Go to Google Images and search.</span></div><div class="c"><span

<span class="t">So I would call this "teddies.txt" and press Save.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I now have a file of teddies or URLs of teddies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So then I would repeat that process for black bears and for brown

that's step one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So step two is we now need to download those URLs to our server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.000</a></span> | <span

each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the next thing that I found I needed to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was to remove the images that aren't actually images at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.000</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">Google image tried to tell us that this URL had an image,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1388"

target="_blank">00:23:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got this thing in the library called verify images,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which will check all of the images in a path</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and will tell you if there's a problem.</span></div><div

easy way to end up with a clean dataset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So at this point I now have a bears folder containing a grizzly folder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and a teddies folder and a black folder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, I have the basic structure we need to create</span></div><div

that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, very often when you download a dataset from like Kaggle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or from some academic dataset, there will often be a folder called train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and a folder called valid and a folder called test,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right, containing the different datasets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, we don't have a separate validation set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because we just grab these images from Google search, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you still need a validation set,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise you don't know how well your model is going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll talk more about this in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So whatever you create a data bunch,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you don't have a separate training and validation set,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then you can just say, okay, well the training set is in the current folder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because by default it looks in a folder called train.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want you to set aside 20% of the data, please.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is going to create a validation set for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically and randomly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll see that whenever I create a validation set randomly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I always set my random seed to something fixed beforehand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This means that every time I run this code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll get the same validation set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in general, I'm not a fan of making my machine learning experiments reproducible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">i.e. ensuring I get exactly the same result every time.</span></div><div

important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a really important part of finding out is your solution stable?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.000</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">But what is important is that you always have the same validation set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, when you're trying to decide,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">has this hyperparameter change improved my model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but you've got a different set of data you're testing it on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then you don't know maybe that set of data just happens to be a bit easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I always set the random seed here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've now got, let's run that cell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so we've now got a data bunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can look inside at the data.classes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you'll see these are the folders that we created.</span></div><div

labels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">black bear, grizzly bear or

like a bump,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but this looks like an

target="_blank">00:28:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see I picked 3E neg 5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, somewhere around here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1730"

big shout out to the San Francisco Fast AI Study Group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who created this new widget this week called the File Deleter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's Zach and Jason and Francisco built this thing where we basically can take the top losses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">from that interpretation object we just created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what we're going to do is we're going to say, okay, that returns top losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not just plot top losses, but there's also just top losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And top losses return two things, the losses of the things that were the worst</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the indexes into the data set of the things that were the worst.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you don't pass anything at all, it's going to actually return the entire data set but sorted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first things will be the highest losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As we'll learn during the course, so we'll keep seeing during the course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1944" target="_blank">00:32:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">every data set in Fast AI has an x and a y.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the x contains the things that are used to, in this case, get the images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the image file names and the y's will be the labels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we grab the indexes and pass them into the data set x,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this is going to give us the file names of the data set ordered by which ones had the highest loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So which ones it was either confident and wrong about or not confident about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can pass that to this new widget that they've created called the FileDeleader widget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to clarify, this top plus paths contains all of the file names in our data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I say in our data set, this particular one is in our validation data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this is going to do is it's going to clean up mislabeled images or images that shouldn't be there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to remove them from a validation set so that our metrics will be more correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you then need to rerun these two steps replacing valid ds with train ds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to clean up your training set to get the noise out of that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a good practice to do both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll talk about test sets later as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you also have a test set, you would then repeat the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we run FileDeleader passing in that sorted list of paths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what pops up is basically the same thing as plot top losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in other words, these are the ones which is either wrong about or at least confident about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so not surprisingly, this one here does not appear to be a teddy bear or a black bear or a brown bear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this shouldn't be in our data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I do is I work on the Delete button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all the rest do look indeed like bears. And then so I can click Confirm, and it'll bring up another 5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What's that? That's not a bear, is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does anybody know what that is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to say that's not a bear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Delete. Confirm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, not bear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's a teddy bear. I'll leave that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not really. I'll get rid of that one. Confirm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so what I tend to do when I do this is I'll keep going Confirm until I get to a couple of screen fulls of things that all look OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that suggests to me that I've kind of got past the worst bits of the data. OK, and that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now you can go back once you do it for the training set as well and retrain your model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll just note here that what our San Francisco study group did here was that they actually built a little app inside Jupyter Notebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which you might not have realized is possible. But not only is it possible, it's actually surprisingly straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And just like everything else, you can hit double question mark to find out their secrets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is the source code. OK, and really, if you've done any GUI programming before, it'll look incredibly normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's there's basically callbacks for what happens when you click on a button where you just do standard Python things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to actually render it, you just use widgets and you can lay it out using standard boxes and whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's this idea of creating applications inside notebooks is like it's really underused,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's super neat because it lets you create tools for your fellow practitioners, for your fellow experimenters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And you could definitely envisage taking this a lot further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, by the time you're watching this on the MOOC, you'll probably find that there's a whole lot more buttons here because we've already got a long list of to do's that we're going to add.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To this particular thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So so that's it. So I think like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd love for you to have a think about now that you know it's possible to write applications in your notebook, what are you going to write?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you Google for eye pie widgets, you can learn about the little gooey framework to find out what kind of widgets you can create and what they look like and how they work and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll find it's you know, it's actually a pretty, you know, complete gooey programming environment you can play with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this will all work nicely with your models and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a great way to productionize an application because it is sitting inside a notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is really for things which are going to help other practitioners, other experimentalists and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For productionizing things, you need to actually build a production web app, which we'll look at next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so after you have cleaned up your noisy images, you can then retrain your model and hopefully you'll find it's a little bit more accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing you might be interested to discover when you do this is it actually doesn't matter most of the time very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now on the whole, these models are pretty good at dealing with moderate amounts of noisy data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem would occur is if your data was not randomly noisy, but biased noisy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess the main thing I'm saying is if you go through this process of cleaning up your data and then you rerun your model and find it's like 0.001% better, that's normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, that's fine, but it's still a good idea just to make sure that you don't have too much noise in your data in case it is biased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So at this point, we're ready to put our model in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where I hear a lot of people ask me about which mega Google Facebook highly distributed serving system they should use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and how do they use a thousand GPUs at the same time and whatever else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For the vast, vast, vast majority of things that you all do, you will want to actually run in production on a CPU, not a GPU.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is that?

We don't have a Cougar Detector, we have a Teddy Bear Detector, and my daughter Claire is about to decide whether to cuddle this friend, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what she does is she takes Daddy's Deep Learning model and she gets a picture of this, and here is a picture that she's uploaded to the web app, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here is a picture of the potentially cuddlesome object, and so we're going to store that in a very record image.</span></div><div

funnily enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is that list of classes that we saved earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as per usual, we created a data bunch, but this time we're not going to create a data bunch from a folder full of images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to create a special kind of data bunch, which is one that's going to grab one single image at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2526" target="_blank">00:42:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're not actually passing it any data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only reason we pass it a path is so that it knows where to load our model from, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just the path, that's the folder that the model is going to be in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2537" target="_blank">00:42:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we do need to do is that we need to pass it the same information that we trained with, so the same transforms, the same size, the same normalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is all stuff we'll learn more about, but just make sure it's the same stuff that you used before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2550" target="_blank">00:42:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now you've got a data bunch that actually doesn't have any data in it at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just something that knows how to transform a new image in the same way that you trained with, so that you can now do inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can now create a CNN with this kind of fake data bunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, you would use exactly the same model that you trained with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can now load in those saved weights, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is the stuff that you would do once, just once when your web app's starting up, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it takes, you know, 0.1 of a second to run this code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you just go learn.predict image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2588" target="_blank">00:43:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's lucky we did that because it is not a teddy bear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is actually a black bear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So thankfully, due to this excellent deep learning model, my daughter will avoid having a very embarrassing black bear cut-all incident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does this look like in production?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I took Simon Willison's code and shamelessly stole it, made it probably a little bit worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically it's going to look something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now Simon used a really cool web app toolkit called Starlet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you've ever used Flask, this will look extremely similar, but it's kind of a more modern approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And by modern, what I really mean is that you can use a weight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This basically means that you can wait for something that takes a while, such as grabbing some data, without using up a process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for things like I want to get a prediction or I want to load up some data or whatever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's really great to be able to use this modern Python 3 asynchronous stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Starlet would come highly recommended for creating your web app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, you just create a route as per usual in a web app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that, you say this is async to ensure that it doesn't steal the process while it's waiting for things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You open your image, you call .predict, and you return that response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2681" target="_blank">00:44:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can use whatever, JavaScript client or whatever to show it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's it. That's basically the main contents of your web app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So give it a go, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This week, even if you've never created a web application before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of nice little tutorials online and kind of starter code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If in doubt, why don't you try Starlet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a free hosting that you can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's one called Python Anywhere, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The one that Simon's used, we'll mention that on the forum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something you can basically package it up as a Docker thing and shoot it off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2726" target="_blank">00:45:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then it'll serve it up for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't even need to cost you any money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2730" target="_blank">00:45:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all these classifiers that you're creating, you can turn them into web applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2736" target="_blank">00:45:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll be really interested to see what you're able to make of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That'll be really fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so let's take a break.

yes it was too, that terrific medium post, I remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3719" target="_blank">01:01:59.000</a></span> |

| <span class="t">So let's look and see how we create one of these functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's start with the simplest function I know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">So hopefully when we said that you need to know high school math</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3766" target="_blank">01:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this course, these are the things we're assuming that you remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you don't remember it, don't freak out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Happens to all

terrific, it's not just for school kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3784" target="_blank">01:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Go to Khan Academy, find the concept that you need a refresher on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3787" target="_blank">01:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and he explains things really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3790" target="_blank">01:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I strongly recommend checking that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3795" target="_blank">01:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now remember I'm just a philosophy student, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3798" target="_blank">01:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All the time I'm trying to either remind myself about something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3801" target="_blank">01:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or I never learnt something and so we have the whole internet to teach us these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3806" target="_blank">01:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to rewrite this slightly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">y = a1 x + a2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3819" target="_blank">01:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's just replace b with a2 and just give it a different name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's another way of saying the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3827" target="_blank">01:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And another way of saying that would be if I could multiply a2 by the number 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3834" target="_blank">01:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This still is the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3838" target="_blank">01:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now at this point I'm actually going to say let's not put the number 1 there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but let's put an x1 here and an x2 here and I'll say x2 = 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So far this is pretty early high school math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3857" target="_blank">01:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is multiplying by 1 which I think we can handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So these two are equivalent with a bit of renaming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3866" target="_blank">01:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now in machine learning we don't just have one equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got lots, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we've got some data that represents the temperature versus the number of ice creams sold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then we kind of have lots of dots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3895" target="_blank">01:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so each one of those dots we might hypothesize is based on this formula.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3901" target="_blank">01:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">y = a1 x1 + a2 x2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3905" target="_blank">01:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically there's lots of, so this is our y, this is our x.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's lots of values of y so we can stick a little i here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's lots of values of x so we can stick a little x here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3919" target="_blank">01:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way we kind of do that is a lot like numpy indexing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But rather than things in square brackets or pytorch indexing, rather than things in square brackets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3927" target="_blank">01:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we kind of put them down here in the subscript of our equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3936" target="_blank">01:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is now saying there's actually lots of these different yi's based on lots of different xi1 and xi2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But notice there's still only one of each of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3949" target="_blank">01:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So these things here are called the coefficients or the parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is our linear equation and we're going to say that every xi2 is equal to 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3967" target="_blank">01:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did I do it that way? Because I want to do linear algebra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3973" target="_blank">01:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do I want to do it in linear algebra?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3975" target="_blank">01:06:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well one reason is because Rachel teaches the world's best linear algebra course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're interested check out computational linear algebra for coders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3984" target="_blank">01:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a good opportunity for me to throw in a pitch for this free course which we make no money but never mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=3992" target="_blank">01:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But more to the point right now it's going to make life much easier because I hate writing loops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I hate writing code. I just want the computer to do everything for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4005" target="_blank">01:06:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And anytime you see like these little i subscripts that sounds like you're going to have to do loops and all kinds of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what you might remember from school is that when you've got like two things being multiplied together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">two things being multiplied together and then they get added up, that's called a dot product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4025" target="_blank">01:07:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you do that for lots and lots of different numbers i, then that's called a matrix product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in fact this whole thing can be written like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4037" target="_blank">01:07:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Rather than lots of different yi's we can say there's one vector called y which is equal to one matrix called x times one vector called a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4053" target="_blank">01:07:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now at this point I know a lot of you don't remember that. So that's fine. We have a picture to show you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4063" target="_blank">01:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know who created this. So now I do. Somebody called Andre Stouts created this fantastic thing called matrix multiplication dot xyz.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here we have a matrix by a vector and we're going to do a matrix vector product. Go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That times that times that plus plus plus plus. That times that times that plus plus plus plus. That times that times that plus plus plus plus. Finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4091" target="_blank">01:08:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is what matrix vector multiplication does. In other words, it's just that. Except his version is much less messy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK. So let's. This is actually an excellent spot to have a little break and find out what questions we have coming through our students. What are they asking Rachel?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK. When generating new image data sets how do you know how many images are enough? What are ways to measure enough?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4123" target="_blank">01:08:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. That's a great question. So another possible problem you have is you don't have enough data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4129" target="_blank">01:08:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you know if you don't have enough data? Because you found a good learning rate because if you make it higher than it goes off into massive losses, if you make it lower, it goes really slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4140" target="_blank">01:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've got a good learning rate. And then you train for such a long time that your error starts getting worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4148" target="_blank">01:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK. So you know that you've trained for long enough and you're still not happy with the accuracy. It's not good enough for the teddy bear cuddling level of safety you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4159" target="_blank">01:09:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if that happens, there's a number of things you can do and we'll learn about some of them during or learn pretty much all of them during this course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4167" target="_blank">01:09:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the easiest ones is get more data. If you get more data, then you can train for longer, get a higher accuracy, lower error rate without overfitting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, there's no shortcut. I wish there was. I wish there was somewhere to know ahead of time how much data you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4186" target="_blank">01:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will say this, most of the time you need less data than you think. So organizations very commonly spend too much time gathering data, getting more data than it turned out they actually needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4196" target="_blank">01:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So get a small amount first and see how you go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you do if you have unbalanced classes such as 200 grizzlies and 50 teddies?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4207" target="_blank">01:10:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing. Try it. It works. A lot of people ask this question about how do I deal with unbalanced data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4214" target="_blank">01:10:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done lots of analysis with unbalanced data over the last couple of years and I just can't make it not work. It always works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4222" target="_blank">01:10:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's actually a paper that said if you want to get it slightly better, then the best thing to do is to take that uncommon class and just make a few copies of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4235" target="_blank">01:10:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's called oversampling. But I haven't found a situation in practice where I needed to do that. I've found it always just works fine for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4247" target="_blank">01:10:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you unfreeze and retrain with one cycle again, if your training loss is still lower than your validation loss, likely underfitting, do you retrain it unfrozen again, which will technically be more than one cycle, or do you redo everything with a longer epoch for the cycle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4265" target="_blank">01:11:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, you guys asked me that last week. My answer is still the same. I don't know. Either is fine. If you do another cycle, then it'll kind of maybe generalize a little bit better. If you start again, do twice as long. It's kind of annoying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4281" target="_blank">01:11:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Depends how patient you are. It won't make much difference. For me personally, I normally just train a few more cycles. But yeah, it doesn't make much difference most of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4298" target="_blank">01:11:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So showing the code sample where you were creating a CNN with ResNet 34 for the Grizzly/Teddy classifier, it says this requires ResNet 34, which I find surprising. I had assumed that the model created by .save, which is about 85 megabytes on disk, would be able to run without also needing a copy of ResNet 34.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4327" target="_blank">01:12:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I understand. We're going to be learning all about this shortly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4338" target="_blank">01:12:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no copy of ResNet 34. ResNet 34 is actually what we call an architecture. We're going to be learning a lot about this. It's a functional form. Just like this is a linear functional form, it doesn't take up any room, it doesn't contain anything, it's just a function. ResNet 34 is just a function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4355" target="_blank">01:12:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't contain anything, it doesn't store anything. I think the confusion here is that we often use a pre-trained neural net that's being learnt on ImageNet. In this case, we don't need to use a pre-trained neural net.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4371" target="_blank">01:12:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, to entirely avoid that even getting created, you can actually pass pre-trained equals false, and that'll ensure that nothing even gets loaded, which will save you another .2 seconds, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4391" target="_blank">01:13:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we'll be learning a lot more about this, so don't worry if this is a bit unclear. But the basic idea is, this thing here is basically the equivalent of saying, is it a line, or is it a quadratic, or is it a reciprocal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4405" target="_blank">01:13:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just a function. This is the ResNet 34 function. It's a mathematical function. It doesn't take any storage, it doesn't have any numbers, it doesn't have to be loaded, as opposed to a pre-trained model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4419" target="_blank">01:13:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's why when we did it at inference time, the thing that took space is this bit, which is where we load our parameters, which is basically saying, as we were able to find out, what are the values of A and B.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4440" target="_blank">01:14:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to store those numbers. But for ResNet 34, you don't just store two numbers, you store a few millions, or a few tens of millions of numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4453" target="_blank">01:14:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So why did we do all this? Well, it's because I wanted to be able to write it out like this. And the nice thing of being able to write it out like this is that we can now do that in PyTorch with no loops, single line of code, and it's also going to run faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4475" target="_blank">01:14:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">PyTorch really doesn't like loops. It really wants you to send it a whole equation to do all at once, which means you really want to try and specify things in these kind of linear algebra ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4487" target="_blank">01:14:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go and take a look, because what we're going to try and do then is we're going to try and take this, we're going to call it an architecture. This is like the tiniest world's tiniest neural network. It's got two parameters, you know, A1 and A2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4503" target="_blank">01:15:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to try and fit this architecture to some data. So let's jump into a notebook and generate some dots, right, and see if we can get it to fit a line somehow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4517" target="_blank">01:15:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the somehow is going to be using something called SGD. What is SGD? Well, there's two types of SGD. The first one is where I said in Lesson 1, "Hey, you should all try building these models and try and come up with something cool."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4535" target="_blank">01:15:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you guys all experimented and found really good stuff. So that's where the S would be student. That would be student gradient descent. So that's version 1 of SGD. Version 2 of SGD, which is what we're going to talk about today, is where we're going to have a computer try lots of things and try and come up with a really good function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4552" target="_blank">01:15:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that will be called "Stochastic Gradient Descent". So the other one that you hear a lot on Twitter is "Stochastic Grad Student Descent". So that's the other one that you hear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4567" target="_blank">01:16:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to jump into Lesson 2, SGD. And so we're going to kind of go bottom up rather than top down. We're going to create the simplest possible model we can, which is going to be a linear model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4583" target="_blank">01:16:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the first thing that we need is we need some data. And so we're going to generate some data. The data we're going to generate looks like this. So this might represent temperature and this might represent number of ice creams we sell or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4597" target="_blank">01:16:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're just going to create some synthetic data that we know is following a line. And so as we build this, we're actually going to learn a little bit about PyTorch as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4608" target="_blank">01:16:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically the way we're going to generate this data is by creating some coefficients. A1 will be 3 and A2 will be 2. And we're going to create some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4623" target="_blank">01:17:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like we just looked at before, basically a column of numbers for our x's and a whole bunch of 1's. And then we're going to do this, x at a. What is x at a? x at a in Python means a matrix product between x and a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4642" target="_blank">01:17:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually is even more general than that. It can be a vector-vector product, a matrix-vector product, a vector-matrix product, or a matrix-matrix product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4649" target="_blank">01:17:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then actually in PyTorch specifically, it can mean even more general things where we get into higher-rank tensors, which we will learn all about very soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4659" target="_blank">01:17:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is basically the key thing that's going to go on in all of our deep learning. The vast majority of the time, our computers are going to be basically doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4669" target="_blank">01:17:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Multiplying numbers together and adding them up, which is a surprisingly useful thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4678" target="_blank">01:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK. So we basically are going to generate some data by creating a line and then we're going to add some random numbers to it. But let's go back and see how we created x and a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4689" target="_blank">01:18:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I mentioned that we've basically got these two coefficients, 3 and 2. And you'll see that we've wrapped it in this function called Tensor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4699" target="_blank">01:18:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You might have heard this word "tensor" before. Who's heard the word "tensor" before? About two-thirds of you. OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4706" target="_blank">01:18:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's one of these words that sounds scary. And apparently if you're a physicist, it actually is scary. But in the world of deep learning, it's actually not scary at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4718" target="_blank">01:18:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Tensor means array. OK? It means array. Now specifically, it's an array of a regular shape. Right? So it's not an array where row one has two things and row three has three things and row four has one thing, what you call a jagged array.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4732" target="_blank">01:18:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not a tensor. A tensor is any array which has a rectangular or cube or whatever, you know, a shape where every element, every row is the same length and then every column is the same length.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4747" target="_blank">01:19:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A 4 by 3 matrix would be a tensor. A vector of length 4 would be a tensor. A 3D array of length 3 by 4 by 6 would be a tensor. That's all a tensor is. OK?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4762" target="_blank">01:19:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have these all the time. For example, an image is a three-dimensional tensor. It's got number of rows by number of columns by number of channels, normally red, green, blue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4778" target="_blank">01:19:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, kind of a VGA texture would be 640 by 480 by 3. Or actually, we do things backwards. So when people talk about images, they normally go width by height. But when we talk mathematically, we always go number of rows by number of columns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4796" target="_blank">01:19:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'd actually be 480 by 640 by 3. That will catch you out. We don't say dimensions, though, with tensors. We use one of two words. We either say "rank" or "axis". "Rank" specifically means how many axes are there, how many dimensions are there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4815" target="_blank">01:20:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So an image is generally a rank 3 tensor. So what we've created here is a rank 1 tensor, or also known as a vector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4830" target="_blank">01:20:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in math, people come up with slightly different words, or actually, no, they come up with very different words for slightly different concepts. Why is a one-dimensional array a vector and a two-dimensional array is a matrix, and then a three-dimensional array doesn't even have a name?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4848" target="_blank">01:20:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not really. It doesn't have a name. It doesn't make any sense. With computers, we try to have some simple, consistent naming conventions. They're all called tensors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4858" target="_blank">01:20:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Rank 1 tensor, rank 2 tensor, rank 3 tensor. You can certainly have a rank 4 tensor. If you've got 64 images, then that would be a rank 4 tensor of 64 by 480 by 640 by 3, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4873" target="_blank">01:21:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So tensors are very simple. They just mean arrays. And so in PyTorch, you say tensor, and you pass in some numbers, and you get back, if in this case, just a list, get back a vector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4888" target="_blank">01:21:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this then represents our coefficients, the slope and the intercept of our line. And so because remember, we're not actually going to have a special case of Ax + b. Instead, we're going to say there's always this second x value, which is always 1. You can see it here, always 1, which allows us just to do a simple matrix vector product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4914" target="_blank">01:21:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so that's a. And then we wanted to generate this x array of data, which is going to have, we're going to put random numbers in the first column and a whole bunch of ones in the second column.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4928" target="_blank">01:22:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So to do that, we basically say to PyTorch, create a rank 2 tensor. Actually, no, sorry, let's start that again. We say to PyTorch that we want to create a tensor of n by 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4949" target="_blank">01:22:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So since we passed in a total of two things, we get a rank 2 tensor, the number of rows will be n, and the number of columns will be 2. And in there, every single thing in it will be a 1. That's what torch.ones mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4965" target="_blank">01:22:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, this is really important, you can index into that, just like you can index into a list in Python, but you can put a colon anywhere, and a colon means every single value on that axis, or every single value on that dimension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4984" target="_blank">01:23:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this here means every single row. And then this here means column 0. So this is every row of column 0. I want you to grab a uniform random number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=4999" target="_blank">01:23:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's another very important concept. In PyTorch, any time you've got a function that ends in an underscore, that means don't return to me that uniform random number, but replace whatever this is being called on with the result of this function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5016" target="_blank">01:23:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this takes column 0, and replaces it with a uniform random number between -1 and 1. So there's a lot to unpack there, right? But the good news is, those two lines of code, plus this one, which we're coming to, cover 95% of what you need to know about PyTorch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5039" target="_blank">01:23:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How to create an array, how to change things in an array, and how to do matrix operations on an array. So there's a lot to unpack, but these small number of concepts are incredibly powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5053" target="_blank">01:24:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can now print out the first five rows. OK, so colon 5 is standard Python slicing syntax to say the first five rows. So here are the first five rows, two columns, looking like my random numbers, and my 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5075" target="_blank">01:24:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I can do a matrix product of that x by my a, add in some random numbers to add a bit of noise, and then I can do a scatterplot. And I'm not really interested in my scatterplot in this column of 1's, right? They're just there to make my linear function more convenient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5096" target="_blank">01:24:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm just going to plot my 0 index column against my y's, and there it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5106" target="_blank">01:25:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">PLT is what we universally use to refer to the plotting library matplotlib. And that's what most people use for most of their plotting in Python, in scientific Python, we use matplotlib.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5122" target="_blank">01:25:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's certainly a library you'll want to get familiar with, because being able to plot things is really important. There are lots of other plotting packages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5133" target="_blank">01:25:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lots of them, the other packages are better at certain things than matplotlib, but like matplotlib can do everything reasonably well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5144" target="_blank">01:25:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it's a little awkward, but for me, I do pretty much everything in matplotlib because there's really nothing it can't do, even though some libraries can do other things a little bit better or a little bit prettier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5159" target="_blank">01:25:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's really powerful, so once you know matplotlib, you can do everything.

So you need some mathematical function that can basically say, how far away is this line from those points?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5410" target="_blank">01:30:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For this kind of problem, which is called a regression problem, a problem where your dependent variable is continuous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5421" target="_blank">01:30:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So rather than being grizzlies or teddies, it's like some number between -1 and 6.

And so the mean squared error is a loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5443" target="_blank">01:30:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the difference between some prediction that you've made, which is the value of the line, and the actual number of ice cream sales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5454" target="_blank">01:30:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in the mathematics of this, people normally refer to the actual, they normally call it Y, and the prediction they normally call it Y hat, as in they write it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5466" target="_blank">01:31:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5470" target="_blank">01:31:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I try to do, like when we're writing something like a mean squared error equation, there's no point writing ice cream here and temperature here, because we want it to apply to anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5483" target="_blank">01:31:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we tend to use these mathematical placeholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5488" target="_blank">01:31:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the value of mean squared error is simply the difference between those two squared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5495" target="_blank">01:31:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can take the mean. Because remember, that is actually a vector, or what we now call it, a rank one tensor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5504" target="_blank">01:31:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is actually a rank one tensor. So it's the value of the number of ice cream sales at each place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5511" target="_blank">01:31:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we subtract one vector from another vector, and we're going to be learning a lot more about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5517" target="_blank">01:31:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it does something called element-wise arithmetic. In other words, it subtracts each one from each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5523" target="_blank">01:32:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we end up with a vector of differences. And then if we take the square of that, it squares everything in that vector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5530" target="_blank">01:32:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then we can take the mean of that to find the average square of the differences between the actuals and the predicted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5539" target="_blank">01:32:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're more comfortable with mathematical notation, what we just wrote there was the sum of (which way round do we do it?)</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5552" target="_blank">01:32:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">y hat minus y squared over n. So that equation is the same as that equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5567" target="_blank">01:32:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things I'll note here is I don't think this is more complicated or unwieldy than this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5580" target="_blank">01:33:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the benefit of this is you can experiment with it. Once you've defined it, you can use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5588" target="_blank">01:33:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can send things into it and get stuff out of it and see how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5591" target="_blank">01:33:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, most of the time I prefer to explain things with code rather than with math, because they're the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5601" target="_blank">01:33:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, at least, in all the cases we'll look at, they're exactly the same. They're just different notations for the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5609" target="_blank">01:33:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the notations is executable. It's something that you can experiment with. And one of them is abstract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5616" target="_blank">01:33:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I'm generally going to show code. So the good news is if you're a coder with not much of a math background,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5626" target="_blank">01:33:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually you do have a math background, because code is math. If you've got more of a math background and less of a code background,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5634" target="_blank">01:33:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then actually a lot of the stuff that you learn from math is going to translate very directly into code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5639" target="_blank">01:33:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you can start to experiment really with your math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5643" target="_blank">01:34:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so this is the loss function. This is something that tells us how good our line is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5648" target="_blank">01:34:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we have to kind of come up with what is the line that fits through here. Remember, we don't know. We're going to pretend we don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5657" target="_blank">01:34:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you actually have to do is you have to guess. You actually have to come up with a guess. What are the values of a1 and a2?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5665" target="_blank">01:34:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say we guessed that a1 and a2 are both 1. So this is our tensor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5671" target="_blank">01:34:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a is 1, 1. Right? So here is how we create that tensor. And I wanted to write it this way because you'll see this all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5682" target="_blank">01:34:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, written out, it should be 1.0. Oh, sorry, it looks like we're starting with -1. -1. Written out fully, it would be -1.0, 1.0. Like, that's written out fully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5696" target="_blank">01:34:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't write it without the point because that's now an int, not a floating point. So that's going to fit the dummy if you try to do calculations with that in neural nets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5708" target="_blank">01:35:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? I'm lazy. I'm far too lazy to type .0 every time. Python knows perfectly well that if you add a dot next to any of these numbers, then the whole thing is now floats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5721" target="_blank">01:35:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So that's why you'll often see it written this way, particularly by lazy people like me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5727" target="_blank">01:35:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So a is a tensor. You can see it's floating point. You see, like, even PyTorch is lazy. They just put a dot. They don't bother with a zero. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5738" target="_blank">01:35:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you want to actually see exactly what it is, you can write .type. And you can see it's a float tensor. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5751" target="_blank">01:35:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we can calculate our predictions with this, like, random guess x at a, matrix product of x and a. And we can now calculate the mean squared error of our predictions and our actuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5766" target="_blank">01:36:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's our loss. Okay? So for this regression, our loss is 8.9.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5773" target="_blank">01:36:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can now plot a scatter plot of x against y, and we can plot the scatter plot of x against y hat, our predictions, and there they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5784" target="_blank">01:36:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? So this is the 1 comma minus 1 line. Sorry, minus 1 comma 1 line, and here's our actuals. So that's not great. It's not surprising. It's just a guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5795" target="_blank">01:36:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So SGD, or gradient descent more generally, and anybody who's done any engineering or probably computer science at school will have done plenty of this, like, Newton's method, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5808" target="_blank">01:36:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all the stuff that you did at university. If you didn't, don't worry. We're going to learn it now. It's basically about taking this guess and trying to make it a little bit better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5818" target="_blank">01:36:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do we make it a little bit better? Well, there's only two numbers, right? And the two numbers are the intercept of that orange line and the gradient of that orange line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5832" target="_blank">01:37:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're going to do with gradient descent is we're going to simply say, what if we change those two numbers a little bit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5839" target="_blank">01:37:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What if we made the intercept a little bit higher or a little bit lower?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5847" target="_blank">01:37:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What if we made the gradient a little bit more positive or a little bit more negative?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5855" target="_blank">01:37:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's like four possibilities. And then we can just calculate the loss for each of those four possibilities and see what works. Did lifting it up or down make it better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5866" target="_blank">01:37:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Did tilting it more positive or more negative make it better? And then all we do is we say, OK, well, whichever one of those made it better, that's what we're going to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5877" target="_blank">01:37:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's it. But here's the cool thing for those of you that remember calculus. You don't actually have to move it up and down and round about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5887" target="_blank">01:38:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can actually calculate the derivative. The derivative is the thing that tells you would moving it up or down make it better or would rotating it this way or that way make it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5898" target="_blank">01:38:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the good news is if you didn't do calculus or you don't remember calculus, I just told you everything you need to know about it, right? Which is that it tells you how changing one thing changes the function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5912" target="_blank">01:38:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what the derivative is. Kind of not quite strictly speaking, but close enough, also called the gradient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5919" target="_blank">01:38:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the gradient or the derivative tells you how changing A1 up or down would change our MSE, how changing A2 up or down would change our MSE.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5930" target="_blank">01:38:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it does it more quickly. It does it more quickly than actually moving it up and down, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5936" target="_blank">01:38:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in school, unfortunately, they force us to sit there and calculate these derivatives by hand. We have computers. Computers can do that for us. We are not going to calculate them by hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5952" target="_blank">01:39:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, we're going to call .grad. On our computer, that will calculate the gradient for us. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to create a loop. We're going to loop through 100 times and we're going to call a function called update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5972" target="_blank">01:39:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That function is going to calculate y hat, our prediction. It is going to calculate loss, our mean squared error. From time to time, it will print that out so we can see how we're going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5988" target="_blank">01:39:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will then calculate the gradient. And in PyTorch, calculating the gradient is done by using a method called backward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=5996" target="_blank">01:39:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see something really interesting, which is mean squared error was just a simple standard mathematical function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6006" target="_blank">01:40:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">PyTorch, for us, keeps track of how it was calculated and lets us calculate the derivative. So if you do a mathematical operation on a tensor in PyTorch, you can call backward to calculate the derivative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6021" target="_blank">01:40:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens to that derivative? It gets stuck inside an attribute called .grad. So I'm going to take my coefficients a, and I'm going to subtract from them my gradient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6036" target="_blank">01:40:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's an underscore here. Why? Because that's going to do it in place. So it's going to actually update those coefficients a to subtract the gradients from them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6050" target="_blank">01:40:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So why do we subtract? Because the gradient tells us if I move the whole thing downwards, the loss goes up. If I move the whole thing upwards, the loss goes down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6062" target="_blank">01:41:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to do the opposite of the thing that makes it go up. Because we want our loss to be small. So that's why we have to subtract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6072" target="_blank">01:41:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's something here called Lr. Lr is our learning rate. And so literally all it is, is the thing that we multiply by the gradient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6087" target="_blank">01:41:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is there any Lr at all? Let me show you why. Let's take a really simple example. A quadratic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6107" target="_blank">01:41:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's say your algorithm's job was to find where that quadratic was at its lowest point. And so how could it do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6115" target="_blank">01:41:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, just like what we're doing now, the starting point would just be to pick some x value at random. And then pop up here to find out what the value of y is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6127" target="_blank">01:42:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the starting point. And so then it can calculate the gradient. And the gradient is simply the slope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6134" target="_blank">01:42:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It tells you moving in which direction is going to make you go down. And so the gradient tells you you have to go this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6143" target="_blank">01:42:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the gradient was really big, you might jump this way a very long way. So you might jump all the way over to here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6158" target="_blank">01:42:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe even here. Right? And so if you jumped over to there, then that's actually not going to be very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6168" target="_blank">01:42:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because then you see, well, where does that take us to? Oh, it's now worse. Right? We jumped too far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6178" target="_blank">01:42:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't want to jump too far. So maybe we should just jump a little bit. Maybe to here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6187" target="_blank">01:43:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the good news is that is actually a little bit closer. And so then we'll just do another little jump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6192" target="_blank">01:43:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See what the gradient is into another little jump. That takes us to here. And another little jump. That takes us to here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6199" target="_blank">01:43:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here. Here. Right? So in other words, we find our gradient to tell us kind of what direction to go and like, do we have to go a long way or not too far?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6209" target="_blank">01:43:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then we multiply it by some number less than one so we don't jump too far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6215" target="_blank">01:43:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so hopefully at this point, this might be reminding you of something, which is what happened when our learning rate was too high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6228" target="_blank">01:43:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So do you see why that happened now? Our learning rate was too high, meant that we jumped all the way past the right answer further than we started with, and it got worse and worse and worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6244" target="_blank">01:44:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what a learning rate too high does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6251" target="_blank">01:44:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand, if our learning rate is too low, then you just take tiny little steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6259" target="_blank">01:44:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so eventually you're going to get there, but you're doing lots and lots of calculations along the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6264" target="_blank">01:44:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you really want to find something where it's kind of either like this, or maybe it's kind of a little bit backwards and forwards. Maybe it's kind of like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6275" target="_blank">01:44:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something like that. You know, you want something that kind of gets in there quickly, but not so quickly it jumps out and diverges, not so slowly that it takes lots of steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6286" target="_blank">01:44:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why we need a good learning rate. And so that's all it does. So if you look inside the source code of any deep learning library, you'll find this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6298" target="_blank">01:44:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll find something that just says coefficients dot subtract learning rate times gradient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6305" target="_blank">01:45:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll learn about some easy but important optimizations we can do to make this go faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6314" target="_blank">01:45:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's basically it. There's a couple of other little minor issues that we don't need to talk about now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6319" target="_blank">01:45:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One involving zeroing out the gradients, another involving making sure that you turn gradient calculation off when you do the SGD update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6328" target="_blank">01:45:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're interested, we can discuss them on the forum. Or you can do our introduction to machine learning course, which covers all the mechanics of this in more detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6341" target="_blank">01:45:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is the basic idea. So if we run update 100 times, printing out the loss from time to time, you can see it starts at 8.9 and it goes down, down, down, down, down, down, down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6354" target="_blank">01:45:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can then print out scatter plots. And there it is. That's it. Believe it or not, that's gradient descent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6363" target="_blank">01:46:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just need to start with a function that's a bit more complex than x at a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6372" target="_blank">01:46:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But as long as we have a function that can represent things like is this a teddy bear, we now have a way to fit it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6379" target="_blank">01:46:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? And so let's now take a look at this as a picture, as an animation. And this is one of the nice things that you can do with...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6392" target="_blank">01:46:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one of the nice things that you can do with Matplotlib is you can take any plot and turn it into an animation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6399" target="_blank">01:46:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can now actually see it updating each step. So let's see what we did here. We simply said, as before, create a scatter plot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6410" target="_blank">01:46:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then rather than having a loop, we used Matplotlib's func animation. So call 100 times this function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6421" target="_blank">01:47:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this function just called that update that we created earlier and then updated the y data in our line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6429" target="_blank">01:47:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so did that 100 times, waiting 20 milliseconds after each one. And there it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6434" target="_blank">01:47:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might think that visualizing your algorithms with animations is some amazing and complex thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6443" target="_blank">01:47:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually now you know it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 lines of code. Okay? So I think that is pretty damn cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6455" target="_blank">01:47:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is SGD visualized. And so we can't visualize as conveniently what updating 50 million parameters in a ResNet 34 looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6466" target="_blank">01:47:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's basically doing the same thing. Okay? And so studying these simple versions is actually a great way to get an intuition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6472" target="_blank">01:47:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you should try running this notebook with a really big learning rate, with a really small learning rate, and see what this animation looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6481" target="_blank">01:48:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Try to get a feel for it. Maybe you can even try a 3D plot. I haven't tried that yet, but I'm sure it would work fine too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6488" target="_blank">01:48:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the only difference between stochastic gradient descent and this is something called many batches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6496" target="_blank">01:48:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll see what we did here was we calculated the value of the loss on the whole data set on every iteration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6503" target="_blank">01:48:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if your data set is 1.5 million images in ImageNet, that's going to be really slow, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6508" target="_blank">01:48:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to do a single update of your parameters, you've got to calculate the loss on 1.5 million images. You wouldn't want to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6517" target="_blank">01:48:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we do is we grab 64 images or so at a time, at random, and we calculate the loss on those 64 images, and we update our weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6528" target="_blank">01:48:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we grab another 64 random images, and we update the weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6532" target="_blank">01:48:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in other words, the loop basically looks exactly the same, but at this point here, it would basically be y^2 and some random indexes here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMHJeQU4Qw&t=6545" target="_blank">01:49:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and would basically do the same thing.
