I will say to Yahweh, 'My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' For it is He who delivers you from the snare of the trapper and from the destructive pestilence.</p><p>He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you will take refuge. His truth is a large shield and bulwark. You will not be afraid of terror by night or arrow that flies by day, of pestilence that moves in darkness, or of destruction that devastates at noon.</p><p>A thousand may fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, but it shall not approach you. You will only look on with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked, for you have made Yahweh my refuge, the Most High, your dwelling place. No evil will befall you, no plague will come near your tent, for He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.</p><p>On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. You will tread upon the fierce lion and cobra, the young lion and the serpent. You will trample down. Because He has loved me, therefore I will protect Him. I will set Him securely on high, because He has known my name.</p><p>He will call upon me, and I will answer Him. I will be with Him in His distress. I will rescue Him and honor Him with a long life. I will satisfy Him, and I will show Him my salvation. Amen.</p></div></div></body></html>
