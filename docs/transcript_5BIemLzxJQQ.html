And you've made the comparison with that and big tech. And one of the things Fukuyama talks about in the book is once there is a struggle that requires the first men of history who can withstand adversity and can accomplish great things, you won't have them around by the time that things have gotten comfortable for a while.</p><p>Are there enough first men left in companies like Twitter and Facebook that now they do face adversity, they can, you know, just like, reboot and go into wartime again? Yeah, I suspect they are, I think I think Tolkien gets it right, you know, just because someone is born a hobbit, and they live in Hobbiton, and they have this nice, comfortable life, like they still have that capacity for and yearning for adventure, and that in the right circumstances, they will, they will rise to the occasion and go ahead and do it.</p><p>And this seems to happen with, with a lot of countries when they face these great stresses.</p></div></div></body></html>
