The audio you are about to hear is a recording from a family emergency preparedness class conducted and presented by Stephen Harris. Stephen Harris is a man who comes from a professional background in the automotive and energy industry, and he's also had a tremendous amount of experience in teaching emergency preparedness and civil defense. This class is one of the most practical family emergency preparedness classes that I have ever heard. I found it to be incredibly useful over the years, very, very practical, and I hope that you find it also to be useful and practical. Some of the information over time can become out of date, so after listening to the class, I would recommend that you check out some of Steve's other websites. Starting at his website, Stephen, S-T-E-V-E-N, Stephen1234.com. Stephen1234.com is a website where he links to many of his other pages with newer, more updated information. He has a page called solar1234.com that has a tremendous amount of valuable information on it. He has a number of other websites, including links to his knowledgepublications.com, where he sells books and DVDs of information on energy. He has many other websites that are linked to from Stephen1234.com. So if you enjoy and appreciate the information, make sure to click on that and go over to that website at Stephen1234.com and see what projects Stephen Harris is working on today. The following is a free seminar on family preparedness. It was given by Stephen E. Harris to the City of Warren, Michigan, Civilian Emergency Response Team on June 26, 2003. It covers the majority of subjects a family needs to know to help protect themselves in the time of a disaster. This file can be found at www.knowledgepublications.com. That's K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E-P-U-B-L-I-C-A-T-I-O-N-S.com. And more information on Mr. Harris can be found at www.stephenharris.net. That's S-T-E-V-E-N-H-A-R-R-I-S.net.

This is going to be a pretty fun seminar and a fun class, and we appreciate your enthusiasm. A lot of people said they just wanted to come here to learn. They thought they had something new. Some people came here saying that they had something specific they wanted to find out. And it's very encouraging to see the amount of people who come in here just because they want to learn something and kind of exploring to see what they can't find out. We have all too little of that happening today in general. My name is Stephen Harris. I work with the Warren Civilian Emergency Response Team. That's the CERT team for you people who are newbies here, where we are going to try to recruit you. I also work for Doctors for Disaster Preparedness. That is a civil defense and health organization that is concerned with the greater health issues of citizens of the United States and sometimes elsewhere. My background is I went to school for electrical engineering education, and I also have a ham radio license. Some of my background is in the early '90s. Before, I used to develop strategic simulations like combat simulators and fun stuff. I wish I didn't get out of that field. And all through the '90s, I worked in the scientific laboratories of Chrysler and Daimler Chrysler, and one of my specialties was electrochemistry. Currently, I am a consultant, private consultant in the energy field. I specialize in hydrogen, fuel cells, solar, reformation, bioenergy, and you'll see how I intertwine energy and how very important energy is to our lives. The reason you're here -- and we can live in a city like this -- and what kills you is lack of energy. We're here because we have a lot of energy, and what harms you is a lack of energy. We're here because we have a lot of energy, and what will kill you very quickly is what happens because you don't have any energy. If you want more information, you can go to stevenharris.net -- S-T-E-V-E-N-H-A-R-R-I-S dot N-E-T. Some of the references of some things I will be talking about you can get in a free book called "Nuclear War Survival Skills." I have up at USA Homeland Defense dot com. We had that name, Homeland Defense, long before 9/11, and it became really popular. So we've been very committed to civil defense and protecting people before it became a news event and part of world history. Now, it's just the cases are there so you can distinguish the difference as you're reading it so it doesn't look like a jumble of letters. Okay. Preparedness, okay? I don't call this survivalism. I don't call this kooky stuff. I call this family preparedness. Preparedness is not things you have. It is what you know. It's what you have between your ears. If you've got a goofy little light like this, okay, it's got a light on one end and it's got a strobing beacon, "Help, help! I'm being repressed. Come help me. Here's my beacon." This does not keep you safe, okay? Preparedness, what we're going to teach you tonight, is not stuff. We're going to teach you principles, things that I can't take away from you. If I give you a class on CPR, you now know how to resuscitate human beings who are of cardiac and respiratory failure. If you walk away from this building five, ten years from now, you still retain that knowledge. You don't need a gizmo, a thing, a stuff with you to save that person's life. That's what we're going to teach you here in the family preparedness class. You don't need stuff like this. If you rely upon your stuff, your things, okay, your little stoves and cook camps and special knives, and you get someplace and you're without it. You're driving through San Francisco and an earthquake happens, and you're on the freeway, and everything comes down around you-- no power, buildings down, people in panic-- and you've got all your stuff here in Michigan, what are you going to do? You're going to give up. You're going to die. If you rely upon your stuff and you get caught without your stuff, you feel helpless, and you're going to act helpless, and you're going to become a victim. So what we're going to do is put stuff in your mind, so if you're out in San Francisco and the whole place comes down around you, you're going to know how, where, and what is a resource to you, and how to find it, get it, use it for the areas that you're sensitive to, the things that are going to kill you or harm you or other people. So keep that in mind. We're showing some things today, but I'm using things to illustrate principles. They're not hard and fast rules. They're not recipes. They're just methods of accomplishing what you want to do. Another name for this is expedient civil defense. Expedient civil defense is what you have around you. Things around you that you have on you or around you or in your house are resources for different things that you don't even realize. For example, we have a big storm coming today. High winds. Knocks off a tree branch. It comes down like a missile. Puts a hole this big right through your roof, right through the shingles, right into the bathroom, shatters the toilet. You're looking up. The rain is coming in. How are you going to stop that leak with what you have in your house? Not a leak. That's the answer I was looking for. Very, very few people will look at a shower curtain as anything but a shower curtain. It's a large piece of plastic that is waterproof. It is about the largest piece of waterproof plastic you have in your average house unless you've got tarps or other things or other bigger pieces of plastic put away. Thermal draperies have plastic. Fiberglass. That's good thinking. Fiberglass what? Some of the longer curtains have fiberglass lining in them. It might be water permeable. Okay. People who answer questions get a card that you put your name on or initial or some other type of identification mark. We have door prizes. I want you to stay through the whole thing. So at the end of the class, I am going to pick up all the cards, and we're going to put them in a hat and draw them. And the person whose name I draw, obviously you ask more questions, you get more cards. The better chance you get to win the door prize. Dumb questions get two cards. Okay. But this is what I mean by expedient civil defense. We're going to be talking about this. What is in your house, and how can you use it when you need it? Don't look at a shower curtain as a S-H-O-W-E-R-C-U-R-T-A-I. Okay. Everything comes down. Five counties, Macomb, Wayne, Oakland, St. Clair, Monroe, no power, two weeks. For whatever reason, what are you going to do? For what? Fire and light. What's your question? I'll give you three cards for that answer. Candles. No candles. No, it's just like, okay, here's, you know, it's more of a rhetorical question. What are you going to do? I mean, you're losing a lot of stuff. Well, five counties. How about five states? Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania. Gone. No power. Do you think it can happen? Yeah. I was out in Arizona doing vehicle development work. I think it was '96 or '97, and we had 11 states out. Eleven states out. Something happened to the power lines, a cascade failure. Eleven states from Washington to Arizona, including New Mexico, out of power. Okay. It's not like you have a thunderstorm, we might have today. And you're in Warren. You've got no power. What do you do? Well, you go to the motel or the hotel in Sterling Heights or up in Shelby Township. You say, oh, okay, we're going to -- you know. You've got 11 states out. You ain't going nowhere. Where are you going to go? You've got to stay home. And what's going to happen to you while you're staying home? What do you lose? We'll get to that in a minute, but what can cause this? An EMT burst, a nuclear detonation high up in the atmosphere. It can bring down the power grid. It can also eliminate -- most electronics won't work. It's a complex subject, which I won't get into. Here's a more recent one. SARS going rampant. We've had three emerging infections in two years, plus an anthrax attack. Who can tell me the three emerging infections we've had in the last two years? Emerging means we've never had these diseases in the continental United States before. Monkeypox. What else? SARS is up there, but you get a card anyway. I think you said West Nile first. Okay, we've had three emerging infections in the last two years. We've not had this. Normally we get one emerging infection every 40 years. We've had three and two. I should tell you, our world is a little bit different today. SARS shut down Asia. You don't realize it because you're not reading the Asian news. Okay, this is people not going to work. I've got news for you. If it was 10 times worse, 100 times worse -- and there are agents and diseases out there that are 10 and 100 times worse than SARS. They are wildfire what they'll go through a population. Your power grid is going to come down from lack of maintenance or other issues. What if you have people not going to work and you get a thunderstorm like around here? A million people are out of power. How fast do you think those people are going to want to go out and fix the power lines? So the power can come down for a lot of reasons. Oh, anthrax. We've had an anthrax attack. It was kindergarten. It was nothing. It cost a guy $1.25 to shut down half the postal system for about a month. A study from the government was 200 pounds of anthrax released airily at an optimum temperature environment with an optimal dispersion unit would kill 2 million people in Washington, D.C. What do you think that's going to do to your infrastructure? You're going to want to stay home. If you're scared and power problems, ice storms can do this and have done it, you want to cripple a city, shoot one driver a day. The guy driving the gas truck, you know, the big trucks, shoot him. You're not going to blow the thing up, I guarantee you, okay? This ain't Hollywood. Gas trucks don't go up in big balls of fire from one little bullet. Just shoot the driver. How long do you think before the gas stations start running out of gas? A day and a half. You don't have gas. Can you go to the grocery store? Can you go to the bank? Can you go to work? Most of us commute 30 miles a day on average. You're stuck with what you got, and food deliveries aren't going to be coming in that quickly either. Let's see, bring down the power grid, go out and shoot a bunch of large transformers, wait for the repair crews to come and shoot them. This is what terrorists have an option to do in this country. If you shoot the repair crews coming to fix something, you take out 20 more large substations, how quickly do you think the repair people are going to want to go out and fix those repair stations? They're going to have to have rings of police around them before they even go in to begin to fix that stuff. So it's not just big things, nuclear weapons. I mean, one man crippled the entire D.C. area and put it into fear for a number of weeks, okay? One man, one rifle, one bullet a day did it. It can happen here as well. So anyways, how long do you think the power will be out, and do you want to bet your life on it? You say, "Oh, it won't be out for three days." You want to bet your family on it? Nuclear detonation, it's not the nuke that kills you, it's the lack of infrastructure. You can choose it's any weapon, any natural disaster. It's not the immediate effects. Nuclear weapons really aren't that big, okay? You just don't have one of them and it doesn't kill everyone in southeast Michigan. They're really pretty small these days in comparison, but it brings down the power grid. It stops the emergency response. It destroys a lot of roads and infrastructure, and it's the people on the outside where most of us live that are going to suffer from the lack of power. We have a cute quote in the civil defense industry. You know the nice thing about a nuclear weapon? You know when one's gone off. A biological agent's silent attack, you don't know what's happened until people start developing the symptoms. But you always know when a nuclear detonation's gone off. Bright light, big bang, you can say, "It's right there." You know to run right there and go help people. You don't know that in a biological. So here's what happens when we're talking about no power. You have no lights, no water, no sewage. Your toilet is not going to work. Even if you did have water, the sewage lines have pumps that pump the sewage up and over hills and back down to the sewage treatment plant. We all don't live uphill in the sewage treatment plant at all. Don't flow downhill. You have no traffic lights. You have no refrigeration. You have no radios, no television, no communications, no ATM, no banks, no Visa cards. How much cash in your pocket? Everyone open up their wallet real quickly, briefly. Your wallet, your purse. Just tell me roughly how much cash you got. About $18. $18. $11. $11. One young, 31. You'll probably be the highest here. Okay, she's got the high. What do you got? $53. Huh? $53. $53. 880 or you just want a card? He just got paid. What was the average answer 1020 30? I got over 200.200 you get a card okay. I can live a lie how would you like to be standing there going I need food and you run to the grocery store and the cash registers aren't working they're sitting there with calculators the ATM you know there's no communications no power lines this just happened you're there and you want to buy a bunch of food and you got 30 bucks in your pocket or 20. I mean if you think I'm going to go off and buy myself a month's worth of food at the last minute when something happens and you got 20 bucks in your pocket you're mistaken except I'll show you how to buy 20 months a month's worth of food for 20 bucks. You got a question? I beat him but wouldn't there be like riots and stuff? Yeah yeah there's an old saying any city is three days away from a riot. I'm going to take back your card for talking. I'm sorry no I'm. I gave you a card already. Okay I work for you. Now okay you get my point you got 10 20 30 bucks in you that's all you got to get foods some people have 200 you're going to ask them can I mow your grass. There's a disaster. What else is gone when the power is gone you got no refineries no trucks coming in no deliveries everyone wants to go to the grocery store they're at worse than 1/10th capacity the registers aren't working the scanners aren't working okay and they're using little they can even grocery stores do have hand calculators for every station okay so they can check you out manually they are prepared for this okay it's just they're going to be very efficient. A young man asked about riots the police are overwhelmed. They got no power the alarm systems are going off like crazy half the signals aren't getting in and the bad actors in our society are going hey you know we can go in over there the cops aren't going to know they're going to show up if they can show up so you have a criminal element who may take advantage of the situation but generally what happens is after your children are hungry for three days and without water and you're becoming desperate and someone else has food and you don't like them or their lawyer you're going to go take it from them okay because your kids are more important if I had a bunch of food and you knew where I lived and your kids were hungry wouldn't you think about coming and trying to get some food for your kids? Through one tactic or another. There are some people here who are going to use the other tactic so yeah there is a civil unrest and civil disobedience section that goes along with this but we're going to talk about keeping you protected from these situations. Hurricane Andrew perfect example you don't know what happened during Hurricane Andrew it became quite lawless down there and people stood out in front of their house with AK-47s and any other type of weapon. They stood in front of their hubble their heap and said this heap is mine okay don't you come in looking through the stuff. The police actually said during Hurricane Andrew if you're attacked or you know shoot, shoot the person put the body up by the street we'll come pick it up. It was martial law it was almost every person for themselves in some situations. That can and does happen in the world. So you're standing there watching TV or not watching TV and you're sitting there and it was me it was 9.50am in the morning and a phone call came in and said Steve turn on the TV. You're sitting there and you're watching both the towers burning and one of them collapses down in front of you and you're going oh great did they release a biological agent are there 30 airplanes coming in we don't know what's going to happen. You're sitting there and you go I don't have any food, water, what's coming. You get this wonderful sinking feeling in your legs. You ever have it? Like you're looking over a bridge like this okay looking way down you get this horrible sinking feeling in your legs you're going what am I going to do you don't want that to happen. On 9.11 the first thing I did was went to the bank with all my money. The second thing I did was I went to the grain elevator up in Armada and I bought 1500 pounds of corn. Now I have two years worth of food for I have about a year and a half for two people okay. A year easily nice and comfortable. I went and bought 1500 pounds of corn. Cost me a grand total of $110. You know why I bought that? Why did I buy? No it does and believe me I had a problem with it going bad. I had plenty of storage for myself. I had plenty of storage. Why do you think I bought 1500 pounds of corn? No actually I make some of the meanest corn bread in the world and I don't care to eat it. Because it's easier to feed your neighbors than it is to shoot them. I didn't know what was coming next. I bought it for my neighbors. Now it's a whole nother class but I can show you how to do some miracle stuff with corn. It's a wonderful food. 1500 pounds for $110 how could you get any cheaper? You need some cooking class. But tell you what when my neighbors get hungry they'll sit there and they'll turn the grinder with the corn in them real quickly. We're eating the storage. I had a friend of mine he went to Costco he likes oysters. They bought a bunch of smoked oysters and they put it in their pantry. So they're eating the smoked oysters and the neighbors are grinding the corn but I tell you what they'll be very happy to grind the corn. That's not in this class though. That's what I did at 9/11. I didn't have that sinking feeling in me. You're vulnerable okay? Down for whatever reason. Stuff is down, it's not working. What can kill you? Everything's not working. What's the first thing that can kill you? What are you most vulnerable to? What's the most important thing to have in your supplies? Water. Huh? First thing you need is food. Medication. That's one for you. One for you. What have you said? What's the most important? Most people are saying water. Do you think water is the most important thing to have in your supplies? Water. Wrong. Wrong answer. Wrong on water. They were in here man. I mean, we're in a really good tier. I took a card away. Wrong. It is not the important thing. Clothing is the most important thing to have. Clothing is your mobile personal shelter. You're saying water because it's 90 degrees outside today. What if this class is in December? Weather kills in minutes. I stopped for a guy on 696 when he had a cold snap. It was 20 below. So I'll say it was 5 below. He was walking down 696. He was wearing a lightweight fall jacket. Maybe a little bit heavier, but not a winter jacket. He was walking down 696. He had a mile to go to the exit. You know what? If I didn't stop and pick him up, he would not have made it. He would have been dead. Minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit with 20 mile per hour winds. A healthy adult human being, you can be dead in 15 minutes or less. Who said huh? I have a freezer at home that gets down to minus 80. Why don't I get down to minus 5 and put you in there for a few minutes? You'll understand what I mean. Weather kills in minutes. Without water, you die how quickly? Within a week. A week. Let's say three to seven days, depending upon your health condition, your hydration. Some people can die in a day. Generally it's three to seven days. And the last two days are miserable. No water kills in days. How long before you die of food starvation? A week. Weeks. Two weeks to a month at least. Some of us can go a little longer. Without vitamins and nutrients, you're not going to have any problems, lack of nutrients for months to a year. Then it's more problems than it is death. This is me. One of the things I do is I do -- give me one of your cards. This is me. We're snow camping. This happens to be 15 degrees Fahrenheit, 30 mile per hour winds, 12 inches of snow coming down. No tent. We're not in a tent. We've got something else we're using. It's a little plastic shelter that we put together that's expedient. And we'll camp outside for days below zero. We're not cold, okay? We're not cold at all. And this is a whole 20-hour class in itself for doing cold weather stuff. I'm going to answer that question. You know what you use a cooler for in the wintertime? You use a cooler in the wintertime to keep food warm. You use a cooler, okay. It's zero degrees Fahrenheit and you have stuff that you don't want to freeze, okay? What might not you want to have freeze? Water. How much water? It's like yogurt. I'm just going to say it. It's like yogurt. You don't want your yogurt to freeze. You really like your strawberry yogurt. You get ornery if you don't have it. Water freezes at what temperature? 32 degrees. 32 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have something in water and that water is not solid, meaning ice, it will always be 32 degrees Fahrenheit. At atmospheric conditions, you will not get water turning to ice with crystals floating around in it below 32. So it's what they used to use in root cellars in the old days. They would put barrels of water down in their root cellars in the wintertime because as long as that barrel of water was freezing, the cellar would not get below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Water is actually releasing heat when it's freezing. That barrel is releasing heat and keeping the cellar warm until it's completely solid. So in the wintertime, you use a cooler to keep your stuff warm. All you do is dump the ice out that freezes and you put in more water from a well and you can keep your stuff from freezing. Wait till we go on duty. I'm going to have some choice. I'm going to remember this. You invited me. This is a 21 hour course in itself. You don't really, in extreme cold weather, you actually don't layer. The one thing to remember is you want to have a thick of a layer all the way around you as uniform as possible that permeates moisture. You put your mouth up to it. If you can breathe through it, that's what you want. If you put your mouth up to it, you can't breathe through it. You're trapping moisture. And that's what moisture control is the secret to cold weather. Some interesting stuff about cold weather. At 10 degrees Fahrenheit, you need as much water as you do at 100. If it's 10 degrees Fahrenheit, you've got to drink as much as if you were in a 100 degree environment. You need that much water. Hydration is very important in the wintertime. For us, certain people who are out there helping in the wintertime, you've got to have water with you in the winter as important as you do today. Okay, hydration. Water drives your heat mechanism in your body. If you become deficient on water, your heat mechanism won't be generating. You'll start getting cold. It's a positive feedback reaction. It runs away. So you become a little bit hydrated in the wintertime, will very quickly can get you dehydrated, can get you into trouble quickly. And you won't know it. So you really want to force water into your body when it's cold. You're outside at 20 degrees working with CERT, make sure you're drinking water. You will actually be warmer if you're drinking water than if you let yourself get thirsty. Another important thing about clothing, your personal mobile shelter. What about Pat Boese? It was 60 degrees outside and he got hit with 55 degree water. They almost called a real emergency to stop the exercise and come take care of him because he was beginning to go into the initial stages of hypothermia at 60. 40 degrees and rainy is almost as bad as miserable as if you were outside and it was just 10 degrees Fahrenheit. 40 degrees and wet and rain can kill you hypothermically about as quickly as being out in cold water. So remember, the most important thing is clothing, your mobile personal shelter. You've got to have that taken care of before you even begin to think about going on to the next system. This is Dr. Pat Cutt. He's a friend of mine. I've done a lot of medical work. Anyone interested in the extreme cold weather system, it's part of Jim Phillips Powell's system. He teaches winter classes professionally. Okay, mobile personal shelter is number one. Then what? The most important thing that everyone said was water. What is water? Water is not only the water itself, it's what you need to hold the water, to disinfect the water, to carry the water, and to consume it. When we say water is number two, we mean all of that. Water is no good unless you've got containers to move it, haul it, purify it. Contaminated water is no good to you. How much water do you need per day? Eight to ten glasses. Who said a gallon? I did. Did you say a gallon because she did? Two. Well, today you do. Today you need two gallons. Okay, how much water do you need a day? Eight to ten. Eight to ten glasses? A later average. The answer is, on average, you need a gallon of water. Now let's qualify that statement. You need a half a gallon a day to drink at about seven degrees ambient, and you're not exerting yourself. If you're exerting yourself, you need a lot more. A mentor and dear friend of mine who worked out in Nevada test sites with experiments and stuff told me he would drink nine gallons of water a day when he was in Nevada in the field working. Okay, one man, nine gallons, yes. Why is it so hard to drink a gallon a day if that's what you need? Because you ain't thirsty. It's about a half a gallon a day that you need to consume. The other half, as the screen says, is for hygiene, cooking, food preparation, and a lot more. If you're in a hot environment, you will be drinking water on a very regular basis. I spent quite a bit of time in Death Valley at 120 doing vehicle development work, and you continually have a bottle of water on you, and you're always sucking on that bottle of water throughout the day. What happens when you have to go to the bathroom? You hardly ever urinate. In a hot, hot, hot environment, you hardly ever urinate because it all comes out through perspiration too quickly. If you consume nine gallons of water, it's very unlikely you're going to be urinating that much in a day. It's going to come out through sweat and through the hydration of the body. It's really interesting to be in a hot environment like that. It's really, and to observe it from a third person. I've been in Death Valley, and the birds walk in your shadow. Literally, you have little birds going, "Tee-tee-tee," hopping along as you move because they want to stay in your shadow. Hot and cold, much more, okay? A gallon's your benchmark. That's what you want to try to have, okay? Most everyone who has personal preparedness supplies does not have enough water. They rely upon their tap. Try to store as much as you can, and we're going to talk about this. Okay, where is the water in your house? If I said to you, and it's the only reason you came, "You need to fill up 100 gallons of water," here's a challenge to you, Expedient Civil Defense. You want to fill 100 gallons of water in 30 minutes in your house, average house. Forget the pool stuff. How are you going to do it?  No bath?  Bathtub! Hold on, hold on. I've got to check. Wrong! Wrong on the bathtub! You see why I say wrong? No, I went to Detroit to get this, okay? I found an abandoned house in Detroit. Okay, wrong! Not in the bathtub. Oh, who says their bathtub's clean? And they'll drink it, right? Okay, you think your bathtub's clean, you've got a residue of all this stuff up in there. You start drinking water contaminated with this, I'll wait until the medicine section of the seminar will tell you what's going to happen to you. Okay.  Trash cans, trash cans. How are you going to fill up water in your house?  No, you're just going to... Something's happening right now, okay? Your spider sense is telling you, "I better get more water now." You've got a half hour, you want 100 gallons. How are you going to do it?  Garbage bag. What are some of the available containers?  Milk cartons have an organic contaminant in them called...  Beer bottles! What are you going to do to fill up water in your house? 100 gallons. 100 beer bottles... Well, maybe in your house.  Trust me, 100 plus.  No! How are you going to fill up 100 gallons in your house?  We've got half the answer, we've got trash bags. What are you going to do with the trash bags?  Garbage cans, maybe.  Give me a card back.   Yes!  Trash bags, unscented, untreated. Some of the trash bags today have treatments on them. Unscented trash bags in boxes, in chest of drawers. In the bathtub? Well, I guess you could put the plastic bag in the bathtub. In trash cans. Oh, right here. The cheapest container in the world. The most space for the least dollar, unless you go to carboards, okay? These things right here, plastic coats, 8, 22 gallons for a box. That's cheaper than a 30-gallon trash can at 8 bucks. You can put them into here. You've got stuff in there, Christmas ornaments? Dump them. Dump the junk out and put the water in there, okay? You can even do it without a trash can.  No. Tupperware are little things you put in your purse, you take to work, you eat macaroni and cheese out of.  Don't say Avon either, okay?  Kiddie pool! Fifteen-dollar kiddie pool! 300 gallons of water. What's this important? Not much for us, but I've got friends in Tucson. They run out of water. They're dead. They're 50, 60 miles from a lake. They can't leave the valley. It's 100 degrees. You're out of water, you're dead. The wells are 1,000 feet deep. They ain't going to get more water. If there's something happening, they think their power's going to go out, $15 for something you can inflate in 30 seconds with a vacuum cleaner and put 300 gallons of water in is a heck of an emergency storage reservoir of water. Everyone's going to think of swimming pools in Tucson, okay? Everyone's going to be in everyone else's swimming pools, and if you want your own personal storage, you've got to have something or anything under control. So kiddie pools work good for that. But for us in Michigan, trash bags in boxes, drawers, bathtub, trash can, what is water in a bathtub good for? Even that bathtub you saw?  If you can flush your toilet, it's good for water for--if you've got a bunch of blood and other stuff worse than the bathtub, it's good for washing that off. It's good for things like that. So we would want water that's called non-potable. Yes, young lady?  Get what?  Someone translate, I can't hear.  Trash bag! Put it in the trash bag, put the bag into the drawers.  Water weighs. Who can tell me what water weighs to two digits?  How much does water weigh?  To two digits.  To two digits, that's one digit. How much can--even in metric, who can tell me what water weighs? One liter of water is 2.2 kilograms in English units. One gallon of water is 8.3 pounds. So 22 times 8.3. You would put it someplace, like in the room, put the trash bag in, and then you'd fill it up and leave it in place. You wouldn't be--  No, you fill it up in place. You fill it up. You put it where you want it, and you put the hose into--the garden hose--until you fill it up.  Bring the water to it, Mohammed.  What's the saying? If you can't bring the water to Mohammed, bring the--Mohammed?   Two--if this thing is full of water, two men can pick this and move it. It actually won't collapse. This is a good one, okay? Two men can pick up this 18-gallon tote and actually slide it and move it. But it's 8--you know, 20 times 8, 160 pounds. This becomes challenged at that weight. But it's a good way of filling up water pretty quickly. Okay? Drawers--chest of drawers. Normally, like, a foot high. You pull the drawer out, put a bag into it. You can store 20, 30 gallons in a chest of drawer real easily. I mean, just throw--I mean, do what you normally do. Throw your clothes on the bed. Okay, do you understand water and expedient sewage defense? This is one thing for you to remember. If something happens, you procrastinate, you don't have any preparedness. You're going to have to do it real quickly. If you're in San Francisco, and a big earthquake happens, and a fire line is ruptured, you see a bunch of water spurting up in San Francisco, or someplace in California where it's even hotter. You know, you're going to be looking for something to hold water. Start thinking about plastics and boxes so you can grab the water before it goes away. This is what I mean by expedient sewage defense and by principles. This is what I don't want to leave you when you leave here today. Question? He just brought up, what if you have a water bed with the conditioner that you put in the water bed? It's horrible, but what can you use the water bed water for? That's right, you can use it for that. That's perfectly correct. What, he didn't want your card? Yeah, but see, it doesn't matter. He had the idea. You're the one who spoke up. We talked about that in CERT. If you see someone having a problem health-wise or something that your training covers, it could be anything, you think you're right, you think you can help, you have to step forward and take the initiative and help and treat that person. If you're having a heart attack and I think you're going to break his ribs, you don't know what the heck you're doing, I'm going to remove you and I'm going to give him CPR. It's my duty to do that because I think I know how to do it better than you. I could be wrong, but nevertheless, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, and the inaction that comes from it is the worst cancer you could ever have. Think about that. So you had the idea, but you didn't voice it to me. She did it. That's why she got the card. If you think you need to do something, it's up to you to do it if you think it's right or you shouldn't. Don't wait for me to come up and say, "Do you know CPR? Go help him." Question? I have a little pool in the backyard, and if you keep it too long, the water, you've got to put chlorine in it. How long will this water in these pockets stay open? I will cover that question in a bit, but let's cover it right now. Here we go. It's better here than in contact. I've got water in bottles here. These are--well, don't read everything. My girlfriend said the same thing, and she believed every sign that happened. I said I was going to put a sign on the front door. So anyways, these are empty soda bottles that are rinsed out with tap water and filled with tap water, and I capped and put away. These soda bottles happen to be three liters. They're 99 cents a piece. They're at Kroger's. They're my choice for cheap cola, and they're also my choice for a water bottle. These are made out of what's called PET, polyethylene terephthalate. That's what soda bottles are. They don't degrade. They'll stay good forever. A milk carton will degrade naturally over a period of 6 to 18 months. You put water in milk cartons, and if you wash it out really good, you'll start getting leaks. I have done it. Okay, everything I'm showing you here, I have done. I'm not telling you what someone else said. I'm not telling you what was in the book. Everything I'm showing you, I've done. These store for decades. Milk cartons don't. This is the easiest way for you to store water in your house in the event of an emergency. A lot of people consume soda and juice. Rinse the bottles out and put water into them and store them. You store them right on the concrete. Anywhere. And it doesn't matter. On concrete, it'll disintegrate a little bit faster. It happened to me. Generally, no. It shouldn't. I can't think of anything that plastic is so unreactive. I can't think of anything within the calcium chemistry of concrete that would force deteriorate it any quicker. I can tell you the formula for the plastic and for the concrete. I can't think of off the top of my head what would do it. I could be wrong, but I can't think of anything that would. Am I looking at an inch of water in that program? You're looking at a three-liter bottle that's 14 inches tall.  Reflection. Yeah, my basement's a swimming pool. Well, I figured it might maybe have something to do with you storing them outside in the winter. No. And if you had them in a vat and you were changing the water so they wouldn't -- No, this is in my basement. Okay. Now, the question is, this is just tap water. Should I put anything in there? No. This is city tap water. Do I need to put bleach in there or anything? It's already in there. It's already -- that's right. There's more than enough in there that it's just fine. What's your question, young lady? Why does it -- why doesn't it -- It's a different chemical formulation of the plastic. We make so many milk cartons that we want them to deteriorate in a landfill. The milk cartons aren't underneath pressure. You take one of these bottles of soda with carbon dioxide in them and you shake them up, it can get up to 150 pounds per square inch. It's got to be a very strong vessel to handle the carbonation. It's shook up in trucks when it's moved, gone over potholes and bumpy roads. Not that we have those in Michigan. So they've got to be very strong bottles. And in order for that, the material science -- it's called material science, okay? The material science of the plastic has to be much better. It has to be a different formulation. Like metal is stronger than wood, this formulation of plastic is superior to the plastic used in milk cartons. That's a good question. Does the water go bad? Good question. That's where we're getting to. How often do I have to open up every one of these bottles and pour the water out and refill them? How often do I have to do that? Every year. When you want to drink. That's right, when you want to drink. How often do I have to change the water? Let's say I've got 500 bottles stored. How often do I have to do this all this labor? You don't. All water is about a billion years old. Think about it. All water is at least as old as the glaciers. Most water can be -- that water you're drinking out of the tap, the actual water molecule can be up to a billion years old. So you think your water is going to go spoil on you? What happens -- what spoils water? You get bacteria. You get something growing in it. If you don't have anything in there to grow, you don't have a growth medium, like milk residue is a growth medium. You don't have any bacteria to begin with in there, you aren't going to get -- bacteria is not going to go through that plastic. If you don't have anything in there to begin with, you're not going to get anything. If you wish to test me on this, feel free to come over. I'll give you some water dated 1994 and you can drink it. You're talking city water. City water. I'm talking city water. You're not going to go out and take spring water. No, I'm not going to take spring water. What's your question? What if you don't have a basement? Can you store that in your attic? Attic is a good place for storing water. Above the walls that are supporting walls, you can put boxes of water very easily. Can you heat in a summer? No, no problem. Now, you don't want to drink water that's more than 103 degrees Fahrenheit because it doesn't have a hydration effect on you. You can't keep cool by drinking water more than 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Just to store it just in case. Fine. It's wonderful. It's perfect. Yes, anywhere you can put it. You can put it -- if you take these bottles and you put a piece of wood between them and you start stacking them up, you can stack up a tremendous amount of water in a closet, okay, or anywhere you want. You can even make it decorative, I guess. Do you think I bought all these cases of Evian? No. No. I had a girlfriend, and she loved Evian. She carried a one-and-a-half liter bottle around with her everywhere she went. I called it her baby. Come on, honey, you know, did we have to take the baby to the movies? She carried it with her everywhere. Needless to say, I had her save all her bottles for me, and I picked them up, and I accumulated these over about a period of two years. Why was one upside down for you? Because I had too much alcohol to drink the night previous. What's your question? I can't get hydration effects to get to -- The young lady asked, "Why don't you want to drink water more than 103 degrees Fahrenheit?" Because it won't hydrate. What's your body temperature? 98.6. So if you're trying to stay cool, do you think you can stay cool if you're pouring a source of heat into you? No. Even then, it wants to evaporate to your skin, and it cools you, but the thing is you're taking in too much heat at 103. The good news is it's not hard to cool water down. So anyways, here we go. Here's a bunch of boxes of water. It didn't cost me anything. I got 18 boxes times 12 times 1-1/2 liters just stored and put away. It'll be good there forever. This is just one thing I did. You can deal with anything. You have juice bottles, okay? You are more than welcome to come, and that's one of the things you need to do is you don't keep this stuff to yourself. If you do preparedness and someone asks you about it, you show it to them. You encourage them. "Well, I'm going to come over to your place." You're more than welcome. I would love to have your resources and your talent at my place, even if you're just a strong back. I'd love to have you come over. However, I would be much more comfortable if I helped you with some of this preparedness stuff, and if I had some stuff at your house such that you were more prepared personally and then we could augment and complement each other rather than just have you come over and utilize my stuff. But you're more than happy to come over. You might be turning the grain mill to corn, but I guarantee you, I guarantee you, I can tell you one thing, if you're on a corn diet, store toilet paper. Let's see, how long has it been? It's 7:30, we started at 6, it's already been an hour. 15, 30, 55-gallon drums, if you want them, you can get them at a place called Maxi Container, it's six miles in Detroit, great company. You want the blue food-grade drums, HDPE, high-density polyethylene. 55-gallon drums are a little hard to move around, but it's nice to have one, just put a bunch of water into it. People prefer this to the bottles and stuff. The thing to remember, these are 15 gallons, this is a 30, you can move a 15 around. You can manhandle a 15-gallon drum around from upstairs and downstairs. It's just another option for you for storing water. If you're going down the street and you see someone threw a dresser drawer out and you want to put plastic bags and use that for your storage, fine. If you're going to put them in pop bottles, fine. But whatever it is, do it. Try it, okay? Do I put plastic bags in those drums? No, you don't. Basically, you don't have to put plastic in plastic. So what is water? Water is water, it's the stuff to carry and prepare water. We're going to cover purification real quickly. What are the only two methods to completely disinfect water of all bacteria, viruses, spores? Boiling. Boiling is one of the two ways. What's the other way? Iodine. You said iodine. You are exactly correct on iodine, and everyone is incorrect on bleach. Bleach will not get the spores. It is hard to kill the spores. What's a spore? It's a hard shell that forms around a bacteria to protect it. Anthrax is a spore. You use a sporeicide to kill it. A sporeicide is iodine. What type of iodine? That's a better question. The little iodine tablets you buy at the camping store? No. No. They will not--the little iodine tablets you buy at the camping store, you put in the water? The ones that you buy at Walmart in Mexico. Is it crystalline? Do you open it, it smells like iodine, you see the crystals in there? I don't know what it says. Just make sure you don't get this one, Gary. QSB. No, probably not. This is what you want to do. Complete disinfection is only done with boiling outside of the laboratory, okay? In advance, we reverse osmosis stuff. The only two ways that's available to you is boiling and crystalline iodine treatment. Now, the easiest-- No, you don't need nothing to boil it. How do you do that? Lots of ways, but we'll get into that. Handles. No, actually, you can--if you bring water up to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for eight minutes, you can pasteurize it like you pasteurize milk, and it'll kill a lot of stuff. Bring your water up. You don't have to boil it. If you can just get it to 160, if all you had was--you couldn't boil it, but you could just get it warm, okay? If you could bring water up so it's really hot, which is, you know, 160 is actually where it is, and leave it set there for 10 minutes, you'd be--and that's all you had, you'd be better than if you had nothing, okay? So remember that. The hotter you can get it, the better. Crystalline iodine, the short story, it's the only stuff you are going to be able to get. It's called Polar Pure. You can get it at REI. And why do I say chocolate store? Because in Somerset Mall, there's a camping--there's an outdoor store in Somerset Mall across from the great Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. You can see why I remember that place. So they're right--they're the first level across from the great Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory in the main area. Polar Pure, it's $10 to $12 for a little bottle of crystalline iodine. It'll treat 2,000 to 3,000 quarts of water, okay? Iodine is very toxic. It's very potent. It's very concentrated. But it's a method in this bottle that you can only get small amounts of it into your water. You let it sit, and for like 30 minutes to 30 days, however long you want, and it'll kill everything in the water. If you have a shellfish allergy, if you cannot eat crabs and other shellfish and lobster, you cannot use this method for disinfecting your water because you have an iodine allergy. You'd have to run this through like a carbon filter quite a few times to get rid of the iodine before you could drink it. But that would have to come with you independently if you have that problem. The other thing is--that's the best thing is Polar Pure. You can forget the $200 filters, okay? If you've got a Polar Pure and some coffee filters, you're better than if you have a $200 catadiene filter, I guarantee you, or even a $600 catadiene filter. You can get stuff out with an earth filter. That's how the water is filtrated in the ground. Sand, clay, gravel, rock, you can make one out of a five-gallon pail. It'll take out chemicals. It'll take out everything but the bacteria. You filter it through the earth, and you treat it chemically or with heat. And it's called an earth filter. If you go get nuclear war survival skills at that website, USAHomelandDefense.com, it'll show you how to do that better than I can take 20 minutes and describe here for you. Question? Those filters that you get like for BRITA, is that worth anything? Yes, they're good for taking the iodine out of the water. Drinking iodine water tastes like pool water. Believe me, you'd be happy to drink it if you're sensitive to it, if you didn't want the taste. You can get it through a BRITA filter, an $8 or $20 filter, will remove that taste. So, yeah, if you've got one around, it's a good tool that you already have in your house. Question? Yes, what is the ratio between the iodine and the water? The ratio is approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit. If you took--see, it comes in a little bottle. It talks about cat bowls. I send missionaries around the world. I need them to hydrate themselves. So I talk about cups and gallons. One cup of iodine-saturated water. Water can only hold so much iodine, okay, like water can only hold so much salt. Iodine, water can only hold a very small amount--water can only hold a very small amount of iodine. At 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the hotter the water, the more iodine it can hold, okay, the more you can absorb into it. So at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the amount of iodine in one cup of water saturated is what you'd use to treat five gallons of water. You'd want to keep it in there for at least 30 minutes, and it's called residence time. How long is the iodine in contact with the water? I prefer it to be in contact all night, all day, before you drink it. About 30 minutes would be the minimum. Question? Where is the best place to buy water? Buy water? Right out of your tap. The best--what's the best place to buy water? It's right out of your tap at home. It costs about 20 cents per thousand gallons. And our mayor is supposed to try to reduce that price, too. Question? Can you store other liquids like juice? What did I tell you? What's the number one thing that makes water harmful to you? Bacteria and growth, right? What's in juice? You think it's--no, the growth medium for juice, the growth medium for the bacteria. So you don't want to really store juices. Wait, can you store? If you want to add some flavor to your water, what would be something good to store? Kool-Aid. Kool-Aid, yeah, tea mix, Kool-Aid powder, little things just to give--see right here? This is water with some flavor in it. You will drink more water quickly if there's a little bit of flavor into it, like a squeeze of lemon. You'll drink that subconsciously a lot more than you will just drink unflavored water. It's a trick we use to hydrate people to get them to drink. Do you have iced tea? Sure, iced tea is okay. You've got caffeine. What's your question? How long would cases of POP last? Forever. Forever. Should we start with this here? Sure, sure. What's POP? Generally, it's sugar. It's sterile. It's what it comes with. They can't have people getting sick. No bacteria is going through the can, okay? So basically it's water, it's carbonation, it's sugar or a sugar substitute, some flavorings, and caffeine. So you can store that forever. It's a good question, a really good question. How often do you have to change your water? We covered this. How old is water? No sugars, no organic materials left over. If you've got a bunch of soda and it's sugared, you want to wash that out real well. No soap, just flush it a lot, a couple times, shake it up. You don't want any sugar residue in your water because that can be a growth medium. Just use city tap water. Okay, we're going to go on to food and nutrition, what a lot of you came here for. But first we're going to let you have a little bit of a break, let's say 10, 15 minutes. We'll see you back here, let's say, 10 minutes before the hour. The bathrooms are down the hall and outside in the main police area by the desk. See you back in about 12, 13 minutes. So as I was saying about what's going to happen with the people who are late, we're going to -- Okay, first we've got mobile personal shelter, clothing. Then we have water. Then we have nutrition, which we'll call foods. People like water, nutrition is food, stuff to prepare food, stuff to eat it, store it. So I get asked this question all the time. Steve, in a disaster, a personal food storage, what are we going to eat? Corn is too hard for you to prepare right now until I teach you. Who said beef jerky? It's too expensive, but yes, you can. It's good for like two, three days. Spam. Spam does last at least six to nine years, okay? No, you don't get a car, no vegetables. Beans? What type of beans? Dried beans, right? Nuts in a vacuum container are a very good thing to buy, but they're expensive, but they're good for something to have. The lady said raisins. I want it to be a crime to make raisin cookies because they look like chocolate chip cookies. You bite into them and you get this horrible look on your face. Okay, what--the cheapest thing, okay? What are you going to store? Okay, we got another--crackers are acceptable. Peanuts are okay, yeah. I'm sorry, but you want unsalted if it's a disaster, right? You don't want all that salt in your system or do you? Either. Either or. Whatever you enjoy eating the most. So it's kind of what people--everything people have said except for the thing of beans, you're talking about expensive processed foods, all you guys mentioned, okay? Vacuum-stored peanuts store for a very, very long time. They're excellent source of protein, but they're also a little expensive. So what are you going to eat? Donuts! And I'm not just saying that because we're in a cop shop. What are you going to eat? You are--one of the things you are literally going to eat or make is donuts. Yes. Donuts! Not corn? No. I told you, you're not going to be making--forget corn. You guys aren't going to be using corn. That's a 201 level class. This is a 101. I got to have a whole class just on food just to show you how to do corn. It'll actually be another hour, but we're not going to do that today. What was your question? Eat ruts. I'm going to put you on some--I'm going to just let you go on-- I'm not going to let you go find enough ruts to eat in an entire day, okay? You know what happiness in Sarajevo was like 10 years ago? Finding a tree root to burn just to, you know, to be able to cook something. Donuts. You're going to eat donuts! Donuts. This seems funny now, but it won't. Okay. The old way of food storage, okay? The traditional way, if you talk to Mormons or anyone else or survivalists, they're going to tell you wheat is "wheat, milk, and honey," okay? You get big bags of wheat, you get grain grinders, and you make this horrible wheat bread, which you can hardly stomach unless you really like wheat bread. And then what it does to your digestive system ain't funny. The new way we're going to talk about with the resources that are available to us, these are not resources available to you. This is expensive. This is expensive. That is outside--that's outside of your learning curve right now for storage of wheat. I know people who say, "I got 1,000 pounds of wheat, and I don't know what to do with it." Congratulations, you might as well have nothing, okay? And milk won't keep. Huh? And milk won't keep. It's just a narcotic. No, you can store--we're talking powdered milk. Powdered milk in a Mylar bag will keep 10, 20 years. So wheat, honey, milk--we're going to replace this with flour, oil, and sugar. Why are we going to replace this with flour? It's cheap. It's cheap. It's easy to store. It's on the shelf. You can go get a bunch of it. See this right here? Flour is wheat plus energy. If you want flour to make bread like wheat flour, you've got to get the wheat, then you've got to put the energy into it, okay, to make it into a flour and to cook it. What are you missing in a disaster? Energy, okay? Why don't you just buy your food with energy content already in it, the flour? Oil. Why do I have oil? Cooking. Yeah, cooking. But why do I have oil? What's the big thing about oil? Lubrication. I'm coming to your house for a disaster, that's for sure. It doesn't go around. No bacteria. No. What makes oil go rancid? It's a good question. Yeast. No. No. Oxygen. Air makes oil go rancid. Oil. If you have a diet rich in oil, fatty oils, what's going to happen to you? You're going to fill it up more. Fat. It's high in calories. What do the Inuits eat in the Arctic? Seal blub, blair blubber. Fat, high in calories. Do you need nutrients in a disaster? No. You don't. What do you need? You need calories. The stress alone can burn more calories off you than if you were doing physical exertion. Stress can burn a lot of calories. Let alone, you're going to be sweating if the temperature is higher than 70-something, and you're going to be trying to keep warm if it's cold. All that takes calories. You're going to die of lack of caloric intake. Sugar. Why do I have sugar? Energy. Calories again, right? All of us have too high of a sugar diet. It's going to be a good thing to have for us in a disaster is sugar. Sugar stores very well. It might get hard, but you can break it up. It just gets hard from moisture. It's hydroscopic. It wants to absorb moisture. So these three things are mass produced at cheaper prices today than any time in history. A friend of mine got the same price for wheat. He got more money for wheat in 1952 when he started farming than he did in 2002. What's the cost of inflation difference? About a factor of 5 to 10. We feed the world. We make flour, oil, and sugar at world record cheap prices. Now that's what we're going to do. For your $10 in beef jerky that will last you one day, you can buy an entire week's worth of flour. Now it's good to have beef jerky. That's called a short-term food supply. A couple days. You use this for making a base to go weeks or months. You see the difference? What do people say is wrong with flour if you were in the preparedness community? What's the number one thing they'll crinkle their nose? You say flour. They'll crinkle their nose and look at you and they'll say something. What do they say? What's wrong with flour? Actually, no. What do they say? Huh? Nope. Nope. I'm in a whole different community. They'll say it ain't got no nutrition. Bugs won't even eat it. You put a line of flour on the ground, the ants will go around it. They won't eat it. What's the number one problem with storing wheat and corn and other things? Bugs eat it. Isn't this an advantage? See? Flour is a wonderful advantage. Now that you understand you don't need the nutrition, you need the calories. Don't you see flour as being different? They say it ain't got no nutrition. And they say it ain't got no nutrition, bugs won't eat it. Good. You don't need nutrients, you need calories. Now I say this. When they say this to me, I say shut up and buy a multivitamin. A multivitamin pill is a penny a day at Costco. There are people in this world who wish they had one a week. There are people in this world who die of vitamin deficiency that a penny's worth of vitamins can take care of. And we're blessed to have an unlimited supply of them for a penny a piece at Costco or any other pharmaceutical outlet. Okay? So if you're really worried about nutrition, let's say you have a vitamin deficiency, you've got to have your vitamin A. It's something weird. Make sure you have your vitamins and you combine it with your diet that has no vitamins in it. Does that make sense? There's nothing you're going to get out of something that's cooked and baked, nutrient-wise, that you aren't going to get in that vitamin pill. Nothing. It has everything you need. Again, weather kills in minutes, water in days, food in weeks, months to years for a nutrient deficiency. Take everything you know about modern nutrients, health, and throw it out the door in a disaster, okay? Take your five food groups, your four food groups, what is it? Your four food groups, your balanced diet, throw it out the window. Forget about it. The majority of the world lives on one staple. The majority of the world lives on rice or they live on corn. Rice in Asia, corn in Mexico, wheat in the United States, wheat in Russia, other places in Europe use to live on potatoes as a starch base. That's one staple, okay? It's been done for centuries. You can do the same thing as well. Forget your fruits and veggies. Oh, boy, I love saying that. They're going to be existing in what you can store and put away. Now, the question is how do you store bread? You asked this, didn't you? How do you store bread? How do you store bread? No. How do you store bread? It'll go stale. It'll go stale. It'll go moldy. Here's another one. The thing is, the answer is you can't. You can't really store bread. It's very hard. Now, I'll show you how to do it, but for all intents and purposes, let's show you the best way to do it. Who is my complete neophyte here for cooking? Who is helpless when it comes to cooking? Who -- oh, please, I'd love to pick on you. I just got the big wallet just brought in. Who? Who is the person in here who will say, "I can't do that"? You? Who's my best cooker? Who's my best cooker? Who's my best cooker here? Who loves to cook? Who loves to do -- who loves to do it? You do? You really love to cook? You cook on a regular basis? Good. Come on. I need one person to help as well. Now, I told you the other day, I'm going to show you something that you will never forget, okay, that if you become penniless and poor, you're underneath the overpass, you will never go hungry. As long as you eat a couple quarters a day, I guarantee you won't go hungry. When things got bad after 9/11 for me financially, the economy took a downturn, concerns were other words -- other ways, I lived off my food storage, okay. I ate my food storage for three, four months. When you're in that financial situation, you take every penny you make, you make sure you got your mortgage paid for. Food storage is one of the best insurance policies you ever have. There's people in this world, when they run out of food, they go hungry. I got to the point where I had no processed food left in the house. I didn't have bags of Cheetos or crackers or anything. If I wanted something, I had to go make it. I had the stuff to go make it. Now, I elected to do that because I wanted to make sure I had my mortgage payment done and taken care of, okay. When I had two mortgage payments in the bank, then I started increasing and saving time by buying foods and stuff, and even then it was at a discount. So what I'm going to show you is something that you'll remember for a long time. A friend of mine, we're literally going to write a book called "How to Live on a Dollar a Day Worth of Food," okay. And this is some of the stuff we're going to show you. Now, some of you -- raise your hand if you asked about you want to know how to store food and take care of your family in a disaster. How many of you said those -- some of you really said that. I'm going to show you a week's worth of food. I'm going to show you the prices. Here we go. Here's a week's worth of food. It costs less than $10. What do I have here? I have a bag of sugar. I have too much salt, but hey, 28 cents. I have flour, five pounds. I have five pounds of flour. I spent more money than I should have, and I got some Just Add Water pancake mix, okay. I spent -- this was more than I should have. I got four boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix, 25 cents a piece. This is for when I get tired of making stuff out of flour. I have a jar of peanut butter. I have a jar of jelly. I have some more sugar and some maple syrup. I imagine you could use this like oil as well. I have a jar of oil. I have a jar of oil, okay. All this stuff is cheap. Now, you might say, "I might get bored eating that." Yeah, you might get bored eating some of the things you make out of this. You can say that again. I guarantee you, you will be -- what's that? What did you say?  Oh. You just need the card. You just need a certificate. Now, let's see. I've got to think about how to do this. Oh, no. I should light that first.  No, we ain't making pancakes. We're going to store bread. We're going to store bread. That's right. You don't see a loaf of bread. Hang on. Let me get my stuff. Vodka bottle. Yeah, that's right. We're going to use that. We're going to use this. We're going to use the vodka bottle. Hey, look at that. Vodka bottles.  No, no. My girlfriend was Russian, though, but she didn't drink vodka. Okay, we're heating the pan up. Let's put this over here. Here is the let's open up our flower. Okay, we're opening up the bag of flour. I'm going to have to wash this table down while I'm done. Yeah, so I can blame it on my assistants. Okay, now here's what we're going to do. This is how you store bread. You store bread by storing flour. Okay, now what does it take to make bread? It's complicated, isn't it? How many people have made bread other than the bread maker? You've got to get the flour. You add things to it. Yeast, sugar, egg, milk. You make it into a dough. You knead it. You let it rise. You pat it down. You let it rise again. Then you bake it. Well, that rising time can take, what, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 4 hours, depending upon how you're making your bread, right? What's the baking time? 20, 30, 40 minutes, depending upon your loaf. That's an awful lot of energy. Do you know how much energy I have to have to bake a loaf of bread or multiple loaves of bread? I've got to have your oven with you, okay? That's a lot of energy. If you have to store that amount of fuel, it takes a lot. We're going to make bread in 30 seconds, okay? You're going to make bread in 30 seconds. Now, what I want you to do-- What's that? It'll be delicious. The fussiest child will eat it, I guarantee you. And I'm fussy, and I'm a child. Here's the recipe. I've got a cup here. It happens to be a two-cup cup. Would you scoop up about a cup? I'll fill this up, okay? About a cup. Just pour it, scoop it. Here's a little-- You make a mess, you're cleaning it up. Okay, about a cup, half full? A little bit less. Pour some out, just so we have room in there. Okay, we've got about a cup in here. Now, this is a precise measurement, right? You know, scoop it, right? Did I tell you you've got to have 1.00 cups or anything? Just scoop it up, right? Now, I want you to put an accurately calibrated, precise one dab of oil. Okay, just kind of go boop, just about a tablespoon. Oh, one tablespoon? No, about a dab. Just go boop. How about a little bit more of a doop in there? Just a little bit. Stop, that's too much. That's okay. Okay, well, that-- Okay, she put a dollop of oil in there, just a-- of oil into this flour, okay? Now, we're going to get real technical. I want you to put in a couple of sprinkles of salt into here. Oh, maybe half a teaspoon, but a couple of sprinkles, you know, just an amount. If you have too much salt in one of your recipes, you'll know it. And now-- Well, I could do. And now, we're going to make the bread. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Where is my spatula? Okay, I have a turning implement here, the Julia Child Cookbook. Would you please, here, mix that up a little bit? Keep on mixing. Keep thick notes because you're going to make more while we're talking for everyone else to try this. Okay. This is what not the heater--this is not the source of heat I wanted to bring. It was the one I could find real quickly. I have lots of choices. Now, just keep--and I'll start adding water to this, and you're going to make a dough. Just keep on adding water. Put it on the table and mix it up. Just keep on adding water to it until you make a ball of dough. It's not half a cup or a cup of water. There's no recipe. Just keep on mixing it together until you make a ball of dough. There you go. Mix it up really good.  Walmart. Walmart. Remember when we had a class and Blaine was here from Consumers Energy? I hit him hard. I cornered him after the meeting and talked to him for a half hour. Our gas infrastructure is over 100 years old, and it's got 100 years of the best people in the world doing it. It ain't going down. We talk about smallpox, people not showing up for work, massive power outages. Guess what? The natural gas system is powered by natural gas. All the pumps and the substations have natural gas backup. They ain't going--is the dough-- Add a little more. Actually, I want--no, I want--yeah, I do. Okay. Pick up the dough and start moving it into a ball. Add a little bit of flour to it so it's sticky, okay? There you go, a little bit more. Just bring it up into a ball and just knead it in your hands like Play-Doh. The gas system's not going down. Pretty much, you can rely upon your natural gas stove at home. You really can. That is such a huge advantage. It would be two hours of me talking to you about energy just to tell you how to store enough energy to cook for a year. I mean, if you wanted a year's worth of food, it's a couple hours for me to tell you how to store the energy to do that. So if you can rely on your natural gas stove for a couple weeks or a couple months or more, you're doing really good. You got a dough yet? Oh, yeah. Okay, you got a dough. Great, great. Now, if you're not going to use natural gas, propane is a good cheap alternative. I prefer gasoline because I can handle it and I feel comfortable handling it, and I'll explain to you in a little bit why I prefer gasoline as a cooking source of heat. But if you're comfortable with propane, if you're comfortable with your stove at home, it's fine, okay? A few bottles of propane will go a long ways. Tyrant, sure, cook on the manifold. Okay, just grab off a piece of dough about the size of a golf ball. Add some flour so it's a little bit less sticky. Here, just take the ball, drop it in there. Could you do the same thing if you had charcoal on your gas stove? Charcoal is very expensive. It's a high dollar value for a very little bit of energy, okay? You don't want to rely upon charcoal at all. You don't want to rely upon Dutch ovens or anything. It takes an awful lot of energy in the form of fuel. Now, if you're already beginning to pad this out, you can actually work this out by hand into a tortilla, okay? You can just continue doing what she's doing and roll it out into a tortilla. We're going to show you a little shortcut. A little Mexican lady showed me. And that is, here, just use wax paper and fold it in half. Put the tortilla dough into there. Now, where's my rolling pin? Here's my rolling pin, okay? Expedient civil defense, stuff that you have around you. It can be used for multiple things, beating people, mulled-blue cocktails, and it can also be used as a rolling pin. Look, okay, she gets a couple cards for this. She's using the salt as a rolling pin, and she's rolling out the tortilla dough, okay? Now, remember how we made this piece of dough here. We scooped up some flour, we put in a dollop of oil, sprinkled in some salt, and added enough water to make a dough. Technically, this is a little bit thick, but it's okay, because you might make the same mistake. And here, will you please throw it onto the griddle? Just poop. Now, depending upon the thickness, it's 10 to 30 seconds on the side. It all depends how hot. Tortillas, wide cooking range. If it's too cool, it just takes longer to bake. If it's too hot, it just cooks real quick. So you don't have to be precise about having a flame of a certain size. Just get the darn thing hot, okay, and throw the dough onto it. And if you get really good at making tortillas, you take a wet cloth, and you dab it with water, and it puffs up, makes pockets and everything. But that's beyond me, okay? We're just talking about storing bread in the form of flour. If it's burning, and setting off the smoke alarm, it's done. Take a look. Flip it over real quick. Now flip it over on the other side, okay? See, hers is a little bit thick, so it might take a minute to cook. But, you know, look at this. No, I don't have any hot mess, okay. Would you start pulling off some more balls and everything, so we can cook up some more and roll them out? I'll move some stuff over there. Okay. You think that's done? Yes. Okay, pull it off. Just put it down. Let it -- it's going to have to cool for -- not on the wax paper. It's going to melt it. Just put it down and put it into your cooler. Okay, now here we have some flatbread, okay? There's Norwegian flatbread. There's tortillas. There's everything else, okay? Now here we have a flat piece of bread quickly cooked, about 30 seconds, okay? What can we -- we can eat this thing raw as it is, right? What else can we do with this? Man does not live on bread alone. He puts peanut butter and jelly on it. So you can put -- very good. You can -- if you've got a sweet tooth, you can put some sugar -- some syrup on this. What else? What other things that might be in our storage we could put with this? Butter, cinnamon and sugar, and hot dog. No, you don't want to have them. Beans, rice can go with this. This can be the wrap for beans and rice, which store very well. We'll get to that. And remember I said donuts? You see this dough that she's -- you see this dough that she's making. If you take this dough right here -- see this? This is hot oil. It's at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Remember I told you about how much energy it takes to bake this and bake a whole loaf of bread? Do you think it takes a lot of energy to heat that oil up to 400 degrees compared to baking for a half hour? No. It doesn't take much, does it? See that canning thermometer in there? It's a $4 canning thermometer. It just lets me know that I'm at 400 degrees. So you get oil up to 400 degrees. It takes about three, four minutes. And then you take the same dough right here and you drop it in there and you start making a fried dough. How many have had Indian bread or fried dough, fried Indian bread? Do you like it? It's what it is. If you add a little baking powder to this, it puffs up. Okay? Elephant ears. This is what elephant ears are, okay? It is a whole world of fried doughs. If you add a few more things, if you add some milk and some eggs, like some powdered milk to this and some baking powder -- I think they're cutting some bread off. Flip it over. Now it's doing okay. See, you're making pockets. Okay, if you add some more things, then you start making donuts. Do you see what I mean by we're going to be eating donuts? It's flour, baking powder, oil, salt, sugar, a lot of sugar in donuts. There's a world of recipes that are beyond this class that you can make on top of a skillet. You take 89 cents for a maple pancake mix, okay? You just add water. You put it on top of the hot plate. You've got something like this, a little thicker, that you can put peanut butter, jelly, and syrup on. You're eating something, okay? You're eating something quickly in minutes with a minimal amount of food that is flexible. You can put multiple things on it. It complements what you have. It's giving you something familiar. You're not choking down grainy wheat bread. You're eating a white flour-based product that we as fussy Americans like to eat and we're used to. If you take the pancake mix and add water to it and you drop the dough into hot oil, you know what you get? You get some things that are heavenly delicious, especially when you put sugar and cinnamon on it. Yeah. Eggs. About five months out in the open, fresh, okay? If you have sugar and flour and stuff stored as your base and something happens, the earth trembles, and you're running to the grocery store, you know what you're picking up? Butter, milk, eggs, because you want to add them to stuff that you're baking because it makes them richer. It makes them more flavorful. They're going to spoil, but if you want to get through that month or two months, a bunch of eggs will complement your stuff nicely. If not, you've got this stuff to eat. In fact, here, let me -- sorry, let me tear this up. Huh? He's on an Atkins diet. Who wants some? Who wants to try this? She's making more for all of you to try, okay? Yeah, make another batch. I really wanted to do the frying of the oil here, but it's just too much time to do it. This is plain. It's plain, but you can put stuff on it, and it's better than nothing. We made it in 30 seconds. I want you to remember this. We took pennies worth of flour and a little heat, and we made a bread in seconds. If you're homeless and you're begging for quarters, you're not taking these quarters and going to McDonald's. You're getting a frying pan from Salvation Army. You're making a fire out of some junk that you find, and you're taking the flour and oil and salt and maybe some sugar, if you're splurging because someone gave you a buck, and you're making something that you can eat now, okay? When I was poor, I told you I had my food storage. What's the number one thing I ate? Biscuits. I make some of the meanest biscuits you'd ever taste. I took a little bit of money. I went and got buttermilk, butter, and I used that with my flour, and I made biscuits. They were my snack. I was working my rear end off. I ate biscuits with jams and jelly. I can eat the same thing every day for weeks, okay? You can make me grilled cheese sandwiches every day for dinner. I'll eat them for a month and then eat nothing else, and then switch to something else, okay? I'm not fussy about my meals. How long does an unopened bag of flour last? Forever, which is a question I'll get to about flour. I'll tell you how to store flour. It's real easy. Flour will stay forever. As a fun note, they found wheat in some pyramids in Egypt. Over 4,000 years old, they sprouted it and grew wheat out of it, okay? Ladies, doing okay? Who wants some more? This one's a little thicker and not quite cooked all the way. It's a little thicker and not quite cooked all the way, but it's delicious. Really, you want tortillas to be as thin as possible, but even if you goop up, they're okay. It just makes sense. Does anyone have--does anyone have questions? How come cheese is not in your own food? Yeah, it's a growth medium for bacteria. Now, look at this. I was--the keynote for a preparedness fair, for a Mormon preparedness fair. Those who don't know, Mormons preach to themselves that they should have a year's worth of food storage. Actually, they preach seven years, but most of them come down to around a year. Less than 5% of the community does this. So they have preparedness fairs and stuff, and they invited me to come in as an outsider, as a speaker. This--see this right here? This is the same tortilla dough with a little bit of powdered milk added that these ladies are making right here. They just put in like a quarter cup of powdered milk, okay? It just makes it a little bit richer. And they fried that same tortilla dough in hot oil. It took about 20, 30 seconds. That pot you saw up there, it was a six-quart pot. We were feeding 20 people at a time out of that pot. We were coming up not for seconds and thirds, but fifths and sixths and tenths, okay? And we had tongs putting it in and pulling it out at the same time. And they would put cinnamon and sugar and honey, and the little kids would come up and put the honey on it themselves and eat it. And this is a picture of a mother giving her 14-month-old daughter flour, water, powdered milk, a little bit of--might be some sugar in there, fried in oil. The 14-month-old girl is eating this, okay? Most people think of survival food as yuck. The stuff made isn't yuck.  Can you give us your address so we can come and get some of this? No, you can go to Costco. You can get all you want. I mean, look at this. I got--ouch, ouch. I got two ladies here. I got two ladies here with 5 pounds of flour, okay, with 5 pounds of flour, and they're making food that I'm passing out here to you guys at this rate. One--okay, one burner, one skillet could feed a lot more. Who wants more? One skillet and one burner is feeding a great deal of people. Okay, I think that's probably enough. The same thing with this jiffy. The jiffy stuff here, it requires an egg and shortening. You know what happens? The milk. If you just add water to this, you know what? You can do the same thing. If you have some milk, you put it in there, it's a little bit richer. You can take the cornmeal mix, put a little water with it, make a ball, and you can drop it into the hot oil, or you can do it on the skillet. The thing is, I want you to know, you can cook, you can feed your family with a source of heat, a burner of some type, okay, your gas stove, propane, gasoline, whatever, and a skillet and a pot. No big ovens, no Dutch ovens, no camping ovens, okay, skillets, big lots, $4 a piece, pots, one quart, two quart, four quarts, big lots, $2, $4, $5, okay? This is cheap stock. The flour was $0.89. Everything--I got it all itemized here. Okay, milk, when you buy milk, buy it in a Mylar pouch like a Kroger's, not in a box. It stays good for 10, 20 years. The box will go bad quicker because Mylar is a 1970s, '80s technology. Wax paper is a 1900s technology, okay? Mylar is a much better way to store your powdered milk. So buy it in the Mylar pouches. Flour tortillas, here's the basic recipe, two, one and a half, okay? Two cups of flour, one cup of water, one--I just wrote two, one and a half. But see, the way I told you I like better, a scoop of flour, a dollop of oil, a sprinkle of salt, water to make a dough. That you'll never forget for the rest of your life. Biscuits, a basic biscuit is just add baking powder to the same mixture and it puffs up. And you can bake it. If you have natural gas, you have a natural gas oven, you can now bake biscuits in your oven. Got it? In fact, I got a recipe here. You know, what makes things go bad? It's the oil and milk and stuff. When you bake things, it makes them go bad. It's like cakes spoil, right? And pancakes will spoil because they got--these biscuits here are flour, water, salt, sugars in here, and that's it. Baking powder. Baking powder. Oh, wow. So it's a new one. You know how old these are? No. You can bite--who's challenging? Who really wants to taste this? You really want to try one? You guys are old here. They're three years old. Oh, my God. Taste it. Try it. Bite into it. Your teeth are healthy. I'll taste that.   You can also--  Yeah, it's bulletproof. Oh, my goodness. You're crunching into it, though, aren't you? You're crunching into it. You can remix it with some water and everything. It's got a lot of calories to it. This has been like this in my cupboard. It's not even sealed. It's in this bag loose like this. And, you know, it's stored--this is the age-old recipe for hardtack that they used to use in ancient military on ships, except when you add the baking powder, it makes it a little bit fluffier and easier to crunch through.  You can eat animal food. It might play havoc with your digestive system. You can eat your animals. It's cheaper to buy a Purina.  Oh, this stuff, you can feed on the bread.  The heck with that. Eat the animal. Okay, serious. Let's talk about this. We talked about feeding your family. Here it is right here. Can you build a house out of these? Yes. You know what holds together the brick and-- you know what the mortar is for the bricks in many of the big old buildings in Russia? Eggs. Eggs. You make mortar out of eggs. Here we go. This is what--if you ladies so desire to stop or continue, that's fine. Okay, look at them rolling. Notice--look, here's something to learn. See how quickly they're improving? See how quickly the tortillas are getting better? They're thinner. They're getting better, okay? It's not hard. They're learning very quickly. And it's not costing anything. You will learn very quickly when you need to. This base of stuff I got right here. I got two 5-pound bags of flour for $0.79. I got these at Aldi's. You know what Aldi's is? It's just cheaper than Kroger's, okay? But I got Aldi's in literally five minutes at Aldi's yesterday. I walked right through. I think you have the dollar store. Yes, the dollar store. At Aldi's, it's basically as cheap to buy the 5 pounds as it is the 50 pounds of Costco. Sometimes the 5 pounds are nice because you can put them in Ziploc bags and put them in places, okay? 50-pound bags, 25-pound bags, sometimes they're harder to work. I store the larger 25-pound, 50-pound bags. Flour, 5 pounds of it, $0.79 each. Vegetable oil is the expensive thing, $1.49. The oil you want to store, you know what the fry shortening is that you get at Costco in 35-pound boxes? It's a box with a jug in it, 4 1/2 gallons, $12. It's at Gordon Food Service as well. You know what I'm talking about? These are the frying fish, okay? That's the real oil you want to store. You don't want to buy gallons of oil for $6 at Kroger's. You're better off spending your money on the hydrogenated fry oil for what you're going to be doing. Keep it sealed and it won't go rancid. Vegetable oil, $1.49. Salt, $0.23. Peanut butter, $1.29. Grape jelly, $0.99. Sugar, 5 pounds of it, more than I need for $1.69. Corn muffin mix, $0.25 a piece. Pancake mix, just out of the water, $0.85. Syrup was $0.89. All of this food costs $10.15. Everything, all this food can be made on a skillet. Nothing fancy, a skillet. You can get it on sale for a buck. You understand me? Tortillas, flatbread, cornbread, on the skillet and in oil. Peanut butter and jelly, pancakes in skillet and in oil, like I was talking. You can put pancake mix in oil, make a fry dough. You can put it on top of the skillet and make pancakes. Oil, sugar, water. You got this. You're not doing too bad, are you? That's one week for how many people? One week for one person. The rule of thumb is things that you add water to, like what do you add water to to eat? What do you use water to prepare stuff? Rice, beans. One pound per person per day is about a meal, I mean three meals. Things that you bake that you don't add water to, biscuits. Flour, corn, something that's biscuits, flatbreads, pancake mix, all those things. Two pounds per adult male in America per day. Asians are different. They're smaller, okay, and they eat less. But for us, it's one pound and two pounds are the approximate amounts. So if you have a 50-pound bag of flour, that's about 25 days for one large adult male. Got it? So that's how I say what I have up here is about a week, because I got 10 pounds of flour. I got a couple pounds of other stuff. Got it? Thank you, ladies. Thank you very much.  Really, we have an overflow here. It's passing. Okay, so here's your base. I'm going to look at this. I'm going to look at this. Who wants more? Okay, I'm going to look at this. Look at this, an American child eating this stuff, okay? Okay, here's your base. And now I'm looking at this from a Costco perspective or a Sam's Club perspective or a Gordon Food Service. You guys can split this. Here, you're a cert director. I want you to try this. Come on. Pass it around. Okay, what's rice cost? A hundred pounds of rice is about $15. Do you know that the average Asian eats one pound of rice per day? Believe me, I asked quite a few Asians, okay? They're happy to eat rice three times a day, every day. And a small Asian female eats about--a small loss, average. An Asian female eats about a pound of rice a day. You know that's $78 for a year's worth of food for one Asian. Think about it. I had a friend who took his girlfriend out for a steak dinner. I put this in--I said, "You know, you spent that amount of money on steak dinner that could feed one person for a day--I mean for a year." Now that there's nothing bad that's going on, spending $70 on steak dinner. Just I wanted to put it in perspective as far as food storage goes and opportunity cost. Flour, about $16--I put this in a hundred-pound term. $16 for a hundred pounds is about $4 for 25 pounds. Sugar, $20--$10 for 50. Oil, like I told you, you don't want the jugs of oil like I had, unless you're doing like a week or a month. If you're going for a year's worth or six months worth, you know, larger amounts, you're looking at the 35-pound--they're called 35-pound jugs, but they're liquid and it's 4 1/2 gallons. It's $12 at Gordon Food Service, about $13 at Costco. This is just a large amount of calories for you. Here's what I talk about two pounds per day dry, one pound per day wet. Now see--and what did I miss up here? What's a staple that I've missed that's stored for a long time, years and years, tens of years? Beans. I didn't put beans up here. Beans are about a dollar a pound on sale. Your sugar, are you going with the white or the brown sugar? White. White sugar. Just straight white sugar, the stuff that the nutritionists hate. Now this is your base, okay? You build a base, then you add to the base. What do you use to augment your base to make the stuff taste better and give you more versatility? Butter and eggs. No, you're not doing butter and eggs because you can't store them. Powdered milk. Powdered milk in a Mylar pouch. I've got to get cards out. Sugar and cinnamon. Cinnamon. Sugar's up there. But spices. Spices, sugar. Pepper. Pepper. Some people really like the spices. I don't, so that's why I don't go bam. Yeah, your spices. What else can you use to augment to make the-- But at the same time, though, if this happens, you're going to have all that stuff in your house. No, you're not. No, you're not going to have much peanut butter. You don't have a week's worth of peanut butter in your house. Unless you're a peanut butter holic. Okay, peanut butter hog. I'm saying peanut butter lasts a week for me. Like I said, a week. No, but what I'm saying is if something happens or you've got this as your base-- This is your base. Immediately you'll be able to use egg, whatever you've got in there. Right. Now, once you've bought your base, okay, this is not expensive stuff. You want a month's worth of food, we're talking 20, 30 bucks worth of stuff. But you want to have a better month's worth of food, okay, a little bit more enjoyable month's worth of food. We're talking about adding things to your base. We're talking about peanut butters, jellies. This is stuff you find--especially when you find it on sale. It's what you're keeping out. And another guy I like, his name is Clarence. There's a Clarence. Yeah, and Clarence has a Clarence, and you pick up things. So spices, powdered milk, peanut butter, jelly. What else can you add to this base so you can make other things? Remember, you're making stuff with-- Powdered jelly. You're not going to be in my shelter, lady. You say that flour--how do you store the flour? I forgot flour. Well, it's because the bugs are in it to begin with. If they're not in it to begin with, you're really not going to get them. I have flour that's over 10 years old. You can come inspect it any time. I do. There's nothing in it. How do we want to store our flour, okay? How do we want to store our rice, our sugar, and our--how do we want to store our dry products? How do we want to--vacuum bags would be the best way, but it's not a resource available to most people. Jars. Jars are a good way, but they're expensive. It takes a lot of energy to make glass. You're paying for that energy content of glass. Glass is expensive because you've got to get up to about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, float it over a pool of tin, and then form it. That's why glass is expensive. Plastic bags are a good way, but what's the enemy of our food storage? What degrades our food? Oxygen. Oxygen, and what else? Moisture. Okay? We're going to keep the bugs out. We know that. So one of the best ways--let's say you're going for a month's worth of food or more. I really would love for everyone here to have at least a month's worth of food of these basics. Believe me, you just might be using it. So we're going to be talking about this type of stuff. What did I say holds the world record for storage? These hold the world record for price as far as the amount of space for the best integrity of material. These 18-gallon totes are cheaper than 5-gallon totes, are cheaper than 50-gallon totes, are cheaper than 5-gallon pails. Okay? This size right here. Plus you can generally--if it's full of flour, it might weigh 100 pounds. Two men or two people can still pick it up and move it at least some distance. Question? What's the cheapest-- What's that? What's the cheapest store? Store? Costco, Sam's Garden Food Service. Or the smaller quantities at Aldi's or Dollar Store or any other discount. Oh, these, the totes. It varies from big lots to lows. It has very good prices on Rubbermaid. Lows have a great selection of plastics. When you see them at sale at other places, you see a $4 tote on sale for $2.50. Buy $20 worth, okay? Now, what do you do? We're not going to talk about vacuum packaging. We're not going to talk about using carbon dioxide, dry ice, or anything else. That's a more advanced technique that you want to use for grains, wheat, and corn. We're not going to cover that in this class. What I want you to do is to get-- See, the big thing about storage stuff is the cost of the box that you put stuff into. You can spend more money on this container or other containers than on what's going into it. Look at gasoline. $1.50 a gallon. It's going to cost you $5 for the container to put it into. That doubles your price. You want to store $100, 100 gallons worth of gas, you're talking about $100 in containers, let alone the gasoline. So you've got a $4 tote. Just take your bags of flour. We call it two or three 25-pound bags that fit in here. Put the lid on. See those two holes here on the bottom? I mean on the handles, two holes on each side. Tape these up or use silicone and shove them. Put the lid on. If you're going to be in and out of it, put duct tape around it or any other type of tape. If you want to seal it up for years, silicone it. If you're not going to use it until you get into it, silicone it. That duct tape will work in a pinch. And all of that's going to do is keep the moisture out. Duct tape degrades over about a year or two and moisture will get in. And even then your flour will still be okay. I've got flour that was exposed to the atmosphere for five, six years. It's just fine. It's just that in a humid environment like today and other places in the world, it would be better if you put it into a plastic container and sealed it. Now, if you have nothing else, put it in a clean garbage bag and tie it off shut, your flour, because it wants to absorb moisture. Put it in a bag and just close it. That's a ten-cent option to you for storing your flour. If this is better, that will work. Same thing for rice. The enemy is moisture and oxygen. Seal it up with something like this. You don't have to get fancy. You don't have to-- those seal-a-meal things are ridiculously priced that you get on TV and at Costco. You're spending-- you can spend more money on the plastic than you do on the steak going into it. So forget that, okay? You want to use mass-manufactured, cheapest stuff you can to store your stuff. Any questions on how you're going to store your flour, your rice, your sugar, your oil? The oil you're just going to store in its original container in as cool and dark of a place as you can, closet or basement. You have any questions in your mind at all about how you're going to store what you just buy at the store? Okay. Kitty litter is principally dyed-- Used or new? You will use the used stuff. Well, I mean the scoopable containers that they come in, the plastic ones. Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, kitty litter and, like, gallon jugs and stuff. Well, they're big. You know what? Oh, yeah, sure. You know what? You could even store your flour and your sugar in those little soda bottles, dry them out. You can store stuff in there as well. Okay, that's a--I mean, use what you got around you that's free. Coolers? No, no coolers. Before you-- No, I'm saying that you-- Before you throw it away, yeah. You know the vodka bottles and stuff? You know how I store in vodka bottles and any type of glass bottle, wine bottle or something? I put kerosene into them. Molotov cocktails? No, I don't do it for Molotov cocktails. See, I don't have any kids. I know I won't drop it or break it, but the thing is, if you wanted to fill a lantern up, it's easier to take a bottle and fill up a lantern with kerosene than it is a five-gallon container. Plus, it's free. I mean, I wasn't going to throw it out. I mean, a kerosene container costs $10. That's $10 for five gallons. That's $2 a gallon on top of the dollar 60 you're paying for kerosene to begin with. So if I put away five gallons in jars over the period of a year, that's $10 I save that I can put towards something else. It's just something that I had that I was going to use. If you're worried about dropping it and breaking it, don't use it. Don't do that. But me, I don't have that concern yet. Ask, "What else do you buy in the store? We cover jam, jelly, peanut butter, anything." Oh, something else you can buy in the store that's good? Just add water soups. They're dehydrated. Anything dehydrated stores for years and years, decades, okay? Question? Tuna? If I get some pictures that aren't in here, tuna comes in a very well-sealed can, okay? That can store for a long time. In fact, they've got these really nice Mylar pouches with tuna in it, and they'll store for a very long time. But what's wrong with buying tuna for long-term storage? Expensive, okay? You can store a week's worth of tuna for what you would spend for five months worth of flour. But you'd use tuna to augment your base. Once you had a base, you said, "I have two months worth of food. I'm happy with two months worth of food," and you really love tuna or something, and you found it on sale, you'd buy it, you'd use it to augment your stores. I am -- that's a treat -- I am not a big fan of food rotations. Food rotations where you buy ten boxes of something, take one box off, eat your cornflakes, and you go to the store, you buy another one, you put it back into the back of the queue, and you keep on moving through. Historically, people fail to do this. They fail to rotate their food. I won't even recommend it. I want you to get a bunch of stuff that will store for 20 years, and I want you to put it away and forget about it or, you know, add to it so it's there when you need it. You don't open it up and it's spoiled or it's -- I want you to buy a bunch of stuff that will always be there, and that's your base, okay? I don't want you to spend a lot of money doing it. I covered this a bit. Natural gas will not go off, pretty much, okay? I mean, short of nuclear detonations, large upheavals of the earth and other stuff, you can pretty much depend upon your natural gas. If I was going to tell you how to store stuff for cooking and baking, it would be a class in itself. We talk about diesel, kerosene, propane, price advantages and everything. So you can pretty much depend upon your natural gas not going off. If you don't have natural gas or you want something to augment your natural gas, in case it does go off, for short periods of time, months worth of food storage, you can look at propane. Little bottles of it or the barbecue jugs are cheap enough. They're reasonably priced. And since we're not talking about baking bread over 45 minutes, we're talking about making tortillas in minutes, okay? Propane will work under these situations. Me, I store gasoline in gasoline containers and containers capable of holding gasoline because I'm very comfortable with gasoline. I work with hydrocarbon chemistry, thermal chemistry on a regular basis. You don't keep gasoline in your basement where it can leak and get to a pilot light. I keep it in my garage that's not attached to my house, okay? I keep gasoline because I want just one thing that does a lot. So I can use gasoline. I got a little gasoline Coleman stove. You can get gasoline Coleman stoves at Walmart for $35 and $55. One burner, $35; two burners, $55. The typical green stove, you know what I'm talking about? It runs on gasoline. So if I got gasoline, not only can I move my car if I have to get to places or haul people or move things, I'll show you in a minute how you can make electricity off of it without a generator. I can run my stove off of it. So it's one thing for me that does a lot of different things. If you're not comfortable with gasoline, don't start. If you say, "Well, this is no big deal for me," I can do it safely. Mark Fournier from the War and Fire Department won't throw a fit. Then go ahead and use gasoline. It's much more flexible. Gasoline you can store indefinitely. The enemy of gasoline is oxygen and light, okay? So you want to have cool, dark, and tightly sealed. If you store gasoline in a container you get from the store, a gasoline container, take the spout out. Because the spout's down in the fuel, it'll build up vapor pressure on a day like today, and it'll push down on the gas and force it out the spout no matter how hard you crank it down. You'll get gasoline leak. So you take the spout out and you crank it down, seal the end very tightly. And then when you're in your garage, if you smell gasoline, you know you've got a small leak. It's leaking out, okay? So you've got to be diligent and keep an eye on it. If you store it in metal containers like five-gallon metal tins, be careful. You can get condensation on it and it'll rust. If it rusts to the bottom, the gas will leak out. In your garage, you can just make a mess. In your house, in your basement where you never put gasoline, you'll find your water heater, power light, and it'll end your problems with food storage because you won't have a place to store it. Gasoline, I mentioned, this is me. This is Rachel Nevada. Anyone know what Rachel Nevada's famous for? It's a desert. No kidding. What's near Rachel Nevada? Anyone know? This is worth three cards. A test facility. Whose test facility? Government testing. What testing? Area 51. The lady gets three cards. One, two, three. Area 51's out there. Now, I'm not out there because Area 51. I'm just going through and I happen to have been close to it. Nellis is near there, too. It's called the Nellis Bombing Range, officially, okay? I guess if you violate the perimeter, you get a ticket for violating the Nellis Air Force Bombing Range. No, it doesn't. Okay, here I am in Rachel Nevada. Here's the sign. 110 miles to the next gasoline, okay? And the gas station in Rachel closes at 6 p.m. I'm sitting here. I've got another 400 miles of range in my truck because I've got two 15-gallon barrels of gasoline in the back of the truck because I have a 700-mile range when I travel. Here's actually -- you can see I've got -- underneath the cover I've got two 15-gallon HDPE drums. These are the same drums you use for storing water. I've got gasoline in them. And they're sealed tight. I've got a siphon hose going down into the gas tank and I'm actually refilling. I'm very comfortable with high vapor pressure hydrocarbons, okay? I do this because I understand them very well. I actually refill as I'm driving down the road. I thought you'd just find this interesting. This is actually -- this actually evolved into a concept that I've taught. It's called an Iditarod vehicle. You know what the Iditarod race was? You know, they had to do over 1,000 miles and the dog says go get a vaccine, and then they came back. That's what most people forget. They came -- they went back with the vaccine. This allows -- in emergency services, the Iditarod vehicle allows you to take a vehicle and to go a very long distance one way and then come back. Let's say we had a massive outbreak in the United States. You're quarantined. You're not leaving the state. You're not leaving the city. And we had some dead bodies here, and we had to get them to Samarit or the CDC for analysis. Let's say it was critical. Or a police station radio broke down, the only part was in Iowa. You need a vehicle that can go there and come back without stopping. And, you know, this is how this evolved. It's called the Iditarod vehicle concept. And this is how I tested it and did it. Actually, I'll be leaving tomorrow or the next day. I'll be gone for a month, and I'll drive 10,000 miles, and I'll have these barrels in the truck. They're actually in there now. I will drive past gasoline in the mountains at two dollars a gallon and fill up at less than about 50 in a major town. Other than that, I'd only be able to drive 300 miles. With this, I can drive 700. But that's me. Energy. Let's see, we stopped at eight. Anyone need a break, or shall we keep on going? Energy. This is something else that you'll find interesting and you won't forget. We're going to talk about taking everything, basically everything that you had that was useful and now became useless and making it useful again. Forget your freezer. Forget your refrigerator, your microwave. How many people have a freezer full of stuff? I mean a real freezer full of stuff, like half cows and stuff like that. Generators are for thunderstorms. You have a generator if your power is going to be out for most of the week. I just love when people buy a $500 generator and have five gallons worth of gas for it. It'll be right out in a couple hours. But you use a generator to keep your house, your freezer going, if you have a power outage from something short. We're talking here about major threats to your life that are lasting weeks or months, 9/11 and worse. And believe me, it's not hard for our enemies to do things to us that are much worse. Not--we'll see, what was it? World Trade Center, that was about $100 million. We're talking about economic damage. It's $100 million? No, $100--sorry, we're talking $100 billion. $100 billion of economic damage done to us with 9/11. Disasters that are easy to create and do, we're talking not $100 billion, we're talking tens of trillions of dollars of damage to the United States of America. So generators aren't going to cover it if your power situation is out. So forget your refrigerator, forget your freezer. The first thing you're going to do is you're going to eat everything in your freezer and your refrigerator. It's pretty good eating, too. I mean you're going to be eating steak for a week. Your freezer will stay cold if you don't open it much for two, three days at least. You can put quilts and blankets and other things on top of it and extend that a little bit longer. The meat will stay good in ambient conditions for a couple days as well. Or you can put the meat in your cooler. So with this energy concept I'm going to show you, forget the big stuff. You aren't going to be able to use it anyways. I mean what do you want to use a refrigerator for when there's no grocery store to get stuff and put it back into it? I mean you can make tortillas in 30 seconds. You can't refrigerate your tortillas. You see what I'm talking about? First thing with energy, the most basic thing. I loathe many things the government says, especially ready.gov, the Red Cross website, and a few others. They say make sure you have a flashlight and batteries. People, it is so darn easy to say what type of batteries. Do not bet your life and your emergency kit or your illumination on a little penlight flashlight with two AA batteries in it. It's a very small source of energy. It's actually 2,400 -- it's 2.4 ampere hours in a AA alkaline. A D cell is 14 ampere hours, seven times the energy in a D cell battery. If you have a flashlight, I don't care if it's a dollar EverReady flashlight, you want to have a D cell flashlight. And in it you want to have D cell alkaline batteries. Question? How good are those real big square batteries? Oh, the square ones? The square batteries are actually the same as four D cells put together, exactly the same. So to answer your question. So four D cell mag lights are the same as one of those flashlights? That's right. But what you really want -- four D cell mag lights, a lot of light. You want to use that for searching for a lost child. You want smaller lights for most of your main stuff. So a $1 cheap flashlight works just fine for -- you've got either one, you're not going to trip over stuff in the house. So you want the one that draws less energy from around the house. So you want a D cell flashlight, okay? You want to have alkaline batteries. My preference is Duracell. They have very good chemistry in them. They handle cold and heat very well. Speaking of batteries, what does a date on a battery mean? Who can tell me?  What does it mean? What is -- with the battery, what reaches that date? It's about five years in the future. It's expired. It's expired.  No. Here's all it means. It means at that date, if the battery is stored at room temperature, ambient conditions of a house, 72 degrees, if the battery is stored at those temperatures on that date, it has approximately 82 to 84 percent of its original energy when it was made. So if those batteries would power a radio for 100 hours when you bought them, on that date, five years in the future, if stored at ambient conditions, it would power your radio for 82 to 84 hours. Those batteries will have a great deal of their energy even after 10 years of sitting in your drawer. I have alkalines that are 15 years old, and they still work just fine. After 10 years, they might only have 45 or 50 percent of their energy in them, but that is a lot better than nothing, isn't it?  It's a stupid public point. It's an ignorant public point, okay? And it's marketing and other things, but that's what it means. Now it's a tool for you to look at. I have batteries dated 1998. I can bring them out and show you they work just fine. They're just going to have less power--I mean, less life than a fresh one. But running for 50, 60 hours is better than running for no hours. So they store very long times. True or false? Do your batteries store better if they're in the refrigerator or freezer? False. 100 percent, without a doubt, false, directly from the head chemist at Duracell Corporation. I don't care what popular science, consumer reports, or anything else has told you. I've done it. It's false. Batteries are formulated. Remember I told you I was an electrical chemical person for Chrysler Corporation? What are batteries? They're electrical chemical reaction. It's actually a redox operation of reduction of metal. It's a metal chemistry reaction. They are formulated, the paste, the alkaline paste, and the metal, especially formulated with alloys and everything, to have its maximum storage and operating ability at ambient conditions of a house, around 72 degrees Fahrenheit, because where do people store things? In their house. And they want to be able to advertise they've got the best life of anyone else? That's how it's all developed. Keep your batteries in your drawer. Your basement's fine. If it's 55 or 60, that's in your basement. That's fine. Don't freeze them. Don't put them in your refrigerator. Don't put your film in your refrigerator, not your batteries. Who uses film anymore, though? And you'll get the maximum life on your batteries. Buying batteries at Costco for less than a buck apiece is a great way to have an immediate source of energy. If you're going to have an emergency radio, what do you want it to be powered off of? Batteries. There's that government side again. Have extra batteries. If you're going to put a radio aside, you want it to run off of D cell batteries. A small of a radio you can get running off of D cells. You can get them for $20, $30, $15, $10 a big watch. I take the little RadioShack $8 AM/FM transistor radios, the ones that have two double As in them, and I solder on to them a D cell. You need to get a pack that holds two D cells, a RadioShack, two wires. I solder on the terminals and I put D cells into it. You know how long that little AM/FM radio plays 24 hours a day on two D cells? Three and a half months. Okay? You know those wind-up radios you buy with the springs? You know what spring life is? You know everything has spring life? How many hours do you think before that spring goes boing, it doesn't work anymore? 3,000 hours. Now, in an emergency, how many hours a day do you think you'd be listening to the radio? 12 hours at least. But Duracell batteries at Costco are a bucket--less than a bucket piece, okay? So say they're a bucket piece. Four batteries, two at a time, two batteries in the radio, then you expire them, you put two more batteries in. Those $4 worth of batteries in an $8 radio plays for longer than the spring does. That costs $60, $80. Okay? And you don't have to sit there and crank the darn thing either. You just leave it on. So, D-Cell batteries are really a marvel of modern material science and modern chemical chemistry. They are a world different than batteries that were made originally. Competition has really evolved them. So D-Cell is a key word. Alkaline, I prefer Duracell. If you're buying batteries that you're using all the time, the Rayovacs alkalines have the best dollar per energy that you can use. That is if you're using batteries on a regular basis. If you're storing them, I prefer to have you have Duracell. Rechargeables, don't you dare have a rechargeable battery in anything you're going to bet your life on, okay? I will get seriously angry and violent with you if I see you doing that. Rechargeables have a fraction of the energy of an alkaline, one-fourth, one-fifth in general, okay, in a D-Cell market. Some of the newer ones are half. Same with rechargeables. I told you how long the alkalines last, okay? Ten years on the date, ten years at least in 15 years that I have. Nickel metal high-drive batteries lose more than 1% per day. That means in 100 days, they're dead. You can't store them and put them away and use them, but you can't rely upon them. They'll be dead. They have their own purpose. But not in your go bag, not in your cert kit, not in the flashlight that when you go and grab it, it has to work. Don't ever use rechargeable for any of those. Rechargeables die after a certain number of years. They just don't work anymore. It could be three years, four years, five years, seven years, depending upon how good and what the technology is of the battery. Either way, we're talking about things that I want you to get and put away for years and decades. So when your life is going to depend upon it, it's got to be a good alkaline battery. Oklahoma City, the fire department and police department, they have charge sticks. You know what those are? They're rechargeable batteries all put together, so they go into the police flashlights because they use them every day and the police can't take them home and give them to the kids working their toys. Imagine being a rescue worker, crawling into the aftermath of Oklahoma City. It took you three hours to crawl in there. If you're just getting near the rescue victim, it'll take you three hours to crawl out. Your battery will go, "Foop." There were men stuck in there with no light because they were relying upon their mag light flashlight with rechargeable nightcap stick in it. When the World Trade Center happened, I called my buddies at Duracell and I said, "Guys, get trucks down there quickly," because I knew this was what happened in Oklahoma City. And they said, "Steve, the trucks are already there." They sent semi-trailers full of cases and cases of batteries down to the World Trade Center because they knew that they were going to need them. They were going to be in places. When you're in the dark and your light goes, it's dark. You're stuck there. These senses, your eyeballs are gone. You're relying on your ears and your fingers. You don't want to be in the dark and get stuck. So there's a good thing to remember to take home with D-cells. Okay, now this is for some of you guys and this is not for some of you guys. I'd really like to have the certain members who can have these things have them, and I'd like some of you to have them in your house as well. See this? What did I teach you about stuff? See this? Forget it. Don't go, "This is a battery pack." Don't go, "Oh, what's that battery pack he's got? What does it do?" This is just a 12-volt battery. Why do I have this here? Because I didn't want to haul car battery into the police station. It's too heavy. This is a 12-volt source, just like your car. It's just 12 volts. So please ignore just this little pack right here. What I'm holding up is an inverter. Who can tell me what an inverter does? Supply electricity. It takes DC and turns it into AC. That's right. It takes DC, and you were going to say the same thing, weren't you? It takes DC, 12-volt DC, and it turns it into a modified sine wave, 110 to 120-volt AC. This is rated at 400 watts, which is a fairly decent amount of power. And it will run your television set off of your car. But basically, this takes--you can't store AC. You have to make it, but you can store DC in the battery. So I'm going to clamp it on here, just like I would clamp it onto my car battery. Open my hood and clamp it on and turn it on. And I am producing AC voltage. I'll tell you the real advantage of these things. Come on up here, young man. Come on up here. I need you to be my Christmas tree. Let's hold this up towards the audience. Okay. That's a 110-watt bulb. It's my favorite because this is--all the bulbs I'm going to show you--see these? Who can tell me what these are called? What's their trade name or what class? No, no, no. Fluorescent, but it's called a-- Energy saver? No, it's called a compact fluorescent bulb. Okay. You've seen these? In fact, you've seen these sometimes for $15 a piece, sometimes for $2 a piece. Okay, I got this one for $2 a piece. This is--this puts out the light of a 60-watt bulb, and it uses 15 watts of energy. In fact, this 60-watt equivalent for 15 watts is too big. You don't even want to use this in an emergency. It's too much energy. Okay, this is brighter than a Coleman lantern, most Coleman lanterns. Okay? This is enough light that I would use this to light up this entire area of this room. For your emergency supplies to run illumination--okay, forget--if you can do this--see that inverter? 400 watts. How much do you think it costs? $28. $28 at Sam's Club. Okay? This could be $50 some other places, but I got this for $28 at Sam's Club. The thing is, I can get 50-watt inverters for $28. I can get 400-watt inverters for $28. Each one has their advantage. This is an awful lot of light for very little energy. This is using 3 watts. You have any idea how much 3 watts is? It's a very small amount of energy. If I put an inverter on my car at night and it's a disaster, and I want some light in the house, I can run, you know, five, six of these things and not ever have to worry about starting the car. I can run all night. I can have usable muscle illumination. If I have this, I have this right here. Do you have any doubt in your mind that you can do what we just did here with the tortilla maker and everything else? This is more than enough light, especially with your eyes. Your eyes will dark adapt. You go through different levels of night vision. Here, hold this. You go through different levels of night vision. I'll chop it down. Your eyes get sensitive to light as you're deprived of light and your vision becomes better. So this little 3 watts, you go, well, it doesn't light up nothing. Wait five minutes. You can see everything in the room very easily. OK, so if you're going to go get an inverter, the thing is, what does this inverter do? What can you now power with this inverter now that you've got everything like what? Your cell phone charger, right? What are you going to do when your cell phone runs out of energy? You don't have a 12-volt thing for your car. You can run your cell phone. You now have communications. You've got a radio that runs off of 110 volts. You want to save the batteries. If you've got an inverter, you can run it off of your car. Just put this thing in your car, run the extension cord in the house, run your small radios, your small-- Scanner. Your scanner will run off of this. Your TV. This is a 400-watt inverter. How much power does a big TV, like a 20-inch or 25-inch TV, draw generally? 110, 120, sometimes 200 watts, okay? Look, a car battery has a certain amount of energy in it. I won't go into all the ratings and numbers, but if you're running 15 watts off your car battery, you can run it 8, 10 hours, okay, and then go idle your car for a half hour in the morning, okay? Just bring the--just idle your car for a half hour. You spent $30,000 for the thing. It'll sit there and idle forever. Why don't you use that as your generator to power things in your house that you need? You don't need a refrigerator or freezer. You don't need a big generator. If you want to power a refrigerator or freezer, you need a big generator. If you're not going to use your refrigerator or freezer, you can use a small energy source. Why don't you use your car and $1.50-gallon gasoline to run the things that became useless, your cell phone, your scanner, your radio, your television? In a disaster, you're going to be craving information, and without energy, you're not going to have information and communications. Question, young lady. I don't get it. That light's on for safety. That can't go off. Okay, well, let's plug in--I got a--compact fluorescent bulb. It's a compact fluorescent. I got a little extension cord here. Again, here's a nice extension cord. It's a bucket big lights. I love big lights. Look, this is more light than you need. This is a 15-watt giving you an equivalent of 60 watts. And it gets brighter as it warms up. We've got a few other light sources. Are you having trouble seeing us? This is more than you need. You'd use this for part of an evening in a big room. You want to have smaller lights and be a little more conservative, you'd use this. These bulbs right here, the only place you're going to get them, unfortunately, is Costco, and they're in clearance right now, five of them for $4 apiece. They're chandelier compact fluorescents. If you're going out and buying some compact fluorescents for emergency lighting, try to stick with the five, the seven, and the nine-watt bulbs. If all you can get is a 15-watters, okay, fine. It's better than nothing. But I prefer you to use nine watts or less because you just don't need that amount. You don't need this amount of light. And it just makes life easier for you when you're drawing energy off your car. Again, this is a whole class in itself. I can show you things in a couple of hours, and you're going to be--if you like energy and like electricity, you're going to love it. You'll eat it up. The reason I think CERT members should have some of these $30 devices in their car is because there's a situation where the power goes out in a certain couple blocks, and a lady had to be taken to the hospital because her feeding machine was without power. You guys remember the story? Okay. If one CERT member had one of these things, or the ones who like the stuff, who can handle it, who have the mentality for it, we're all different. That's what makes CERT strong. We have a division of talent and division of labor. One CERT person can keep someone with emphysema, their oxygen machine, going, and it can be a difference between them dying and them staying alive. So you could hook that inverter up to your car battery and run a machine with it. Yeah, yeah. You can run an extension cord in your house, and you can power-- Like if you were responding to an incident. That's right. So you pull the car up there, hook it up to your-- Run an extension cord, $6 for 100 feet. Well, they might have it at the house. Well, for $6, have your own 100 feet of extension cord with you. What I'm saying is you hook that up to your car battery-- That's right. --and you leave the car running. If it's the high-power drain, like a television or something more than 100 watts-- Don't tell them about something that you use for life. I'm not talking about a power TV machine. Well, when I'm talking about higher-power drain, you keep the car idling. If it's only a dozen watts, you can use the battery overnight. If you're going to power something larger, you've got to keep the car idling. You've got to keep the car idling because it's your energy source. Question? I was just going to say, the power inverter that I have plugs right into the power-- That's right. Now, the cigarette-- She asked about the power inverter plugging in the cigarette lighter. You can only go up to 150 watts through the cigarette lighter. If you want to go more than 150 watts, you've got to clamp it onto the batteries. The cigarette lighter can't transfer enough energy to the inverter to do more than 150 watts. I've got some other smaller ones here. See, the 400-watt one, you'd use the 400-watt one for running your 25-inch television or bigger. That's all some people got. But if you want to power it for an hour or two in the evening, that's good. This is a 50-watt inverter. You'd use this for charging your cell phone and running the small lights. Why would you use the 50-watt inverter instead of the 400-watt inverter for smaller items? Hey, this was $12 on sale. You can commonly find them for $20 or $25. Why would I use this little one if I had a 400? Less idle current. Okay, this one, the bigger one has a fan going and more electronics. This one just draws less energy if it's running a small load. Again, I'm not advocating you run out and buy these right now, but it's something for you to keep in mind, especially when you find them on sale. Sure, what's your question? Yeah, it runs off a battery, darling. It runs off your car or a battery. It takes 12 volts DC and turns it into 120 volts alternating current. Those lights above you run on alternating current. Again, your car runs on direct current. Question? Does it matter whether it's a cigarette lighter or a 12-volt power outlet? No, it doesn't. Cigarette lighter or 12-volt power outlet, just as long as you get 12 volts to it. That doesn't matter. In fact, there's -- in fact, you know, they've got little adapters like this. It's a cigarette lighter. It's a socket on one end and it has two clamps on the other end. You use this clamp onto your battery and it gives you a cigarette lighter outlet. This is a good thing to have. As CERT members, we all -- the number one -- one of the best tools we have is our cell phones, okay? With a CERT member and our cell phone, we can get ahold of dispatch, and we can have fire, police, anyone to any location in a couple minutes. We're trained as first responders to observe certain things and to recognize things and to treat and to summon help. The number one thing we do is we bring help and then we treat if we have to. Your cell phone is your lifelink for that. You've got to have a 12-volt cord for your cell phone. You must, okay? Your battery will die after a certain period of time within the vehicle. You're not going to get the door prize, so you're leaving. No, I'll be back. Okay. Well, as a CERT member, responding to an incident, all right, because like mine, it lasts three days. Well, but not on talk. And what if your battery, that will not talk for three days? Yes, it does. I use it every day. You ask him. You cannot -- I ask him on this eight hours a day, three days on one charge. But he's not 72 hours. And plus it might be near, who knows, okay? It could be you could have been out of nothing for two days, you could have been busy, not had a chance to recharge it, and now, right now, you're called out. You only have half a day worth of energy in this, okay? But you still need to have the 12-volt source. Your car is with you. It's a fabulous source of energy. The communications, the number one thing that we can do, we've got to make sure our cell phones are going to work no matter where we are. Most of the times we're near a car, so we want to make sure the car is a source of energy for us, okay? Just hope that you're not in a dead space, no matter how much it's charged. That's right. But, you know, we're in a big city. We're in the third largest city in Michigan. There aren't really many cell dead spaces around here. Okay, so -- So what would be a take-home message for you CERT people? Make sure you've got all the adapters for your cell phones so it doesn't die on you. I'm caught in my own cables here. How about battery pack? Forget it. It's just 12 volts, okay? You're not going to find it. You're not going to get it. It's something special that I get that I send out with missionaries. I want you to get what you have available to you. If you want a battery pack, go buy a marine battery at the store for $60, okay? It's the best battery pack you're going to get. Other than that, use your car as a battery pack. I don't want you to look at this battery pack and say, "I want one. I should have one." You don't, okay? It's a specialized tool that I use, okay? Don't spend money on these fancy batteries and stuff like this, these sealed and carry-around. Go spend less money for more battery. Go get a marine battery, okay? The biggest marine battery you can get is about $60 at Walmart. Get a charger for it. A marine battery charger costs $30. That's a lot better than buying anything that you carry around with jumper cables on it. Go get a pair of jumper cables for $12, some big, long ones. If you really want a battery you carry around with jumper cables, go do this. You'll have a much better battery, much more energy, and you'll have a much better set of cables, and you'll be able to use it as a CERT member. We're all on CERT because we all have different talents and different things that we can do. If one of the talents you want to bring to CERT is the ability to have stored energy, jump vehicles, run lights, run feeding machines, then that's what you should be doing is getting that size battery. Okay, it's a very detailed subject that I just wanted to cover briefly. If you want to get technical, you've got this running in your car, you put a voltmeter on it, I mean like a real voltmeter, get down to 11.5 volts, restart your car, and bring it up above 12 volts, okay? It's the least something I can tell you as an indication. The inverter will start squealing around 10.5 volts saying I'm low on voltage. When you hear it squealing, get out and start your car pretty quickly or you won't be able to start your car and recharge it. Okay, we're getting near the end of the presentation. I'll be doing the Q&A. Now what did I tell you about AA batteries and such? Don't trust them. For what application did I tell you not to trust AA batteries and little cutesy little things? I told you not to trust them in what situation? Life and death, you've got to run out, and your emergency kit has got to work, okay? What I have here, I've got a cutesy little light, right? Don't you ever have this thing in your cert kit or your emergency kit, okay? This is a dual LED and a fluorescent light, okay? I've got another little cutesy little light right here. See this one? It comes on. It's an LED. It goes a long time clamping on things. What's this good for? It's damn good for book reading. If I had this thing, do you think I'd trip over anything in my house if I was walking around with this? Do you think I could find my way around my house easily with this in the dark? Very easily, okay? A lot of stuff, okay? This is more useful to you in many cases than your mag light flashlight. You use a bright light for finding a lost child. For anything else you do, you want to use the minimal amount of light you can. This is called the necessary amount of light. This is all the amount of light that I need to do the task at hand. You can find anything in your entire house with this. You can make almost any meal with this. You can read any book with this. You can't go find a lost child with this. You can't even go find your lost dog with it. Your dog's black anyway. It's hard to see. If you've got to go find something that's lost or it's an emergency, you've got to see everything. You use a lot of light. You use a bright light. You use a mag light. Anything else, you use this little bit of light. You don't take this little light out with you in your kit, okay? You can't depend upon it because the energy source is itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, and it's rechargeable. See these little AAA rechargeables in here, they're nickel metal hydride. They'll die real quickly. But what did I just talk to you about? I talked to you about using your vehicle as a base of energy, didn't I? And using gasoline in your car as a cheap generator for making things that were useless useful again, right? The things we depend upon, which are communications and information, those all become useful again when you have such a small amount of energy. Even this will bring you out of 1800s technology back into the 21st century. This will give you the amount of energy you need, this little 50-watt inverter, to run your cell phone, run your scanner, run your radio, run a small TV, right? That's a lot better than having nothing. So if you've got your vehicle there as a source of energy, this is just a little trick, okay? It's something I've developed and played around with a lot. This is a nickel metal hydride rechargeable, recharger. It happens to be the rail back that recharges in one hour. This is what I send with missionaries around the world. Why do I do this? Because since it's a one-hour charger, you can go up to a vehicle in the middle of nowhere. If they happen to have a vehicle and one comes by, they can go clamp on a pair of cables to the battery and recharge a set of batteries in one hour. And those batteries will run that light, that little light that does everything but search for a lost child, it will run that light for over 100 hours. So in one hour, for $30 and $10, they can run a $10 light for 100 hours. Now, if you're in the middle of nowhere helping people and some of the medical people I help in Haiti and Ghana and travel the world, okay, helping people medically, don't you think 100 hours worth of light is a godsend? I mean, when it gets dark there, it's dark. There are no lights. People are poor. They have nothing. So with these little tools, these little tricks, these little principles of harvesting energy off of a larger source, a car, in one or two hours, and using this stored energy in the form of nickel metal hydride battery and a low-power drain light to give you enough light to do everything but search for a lost child, this is a principle I want you to understand. It's what you need to have if you're going to do more than a month's worth of food storage. It's going to be difficult for you to store a year's worth of Duracell batteries. You keep your batteries for searching for lost children, and since you're going to be in your house and nothing really threatening, okay, you're not searching for something, then you can use these tiddly little lights. Got it? Careful. Some chargers out there take 16 hours. If you've got an inverter in your car all the time and sitting in your driveway running a few lights in your house, keeping things illuminated, you can recharge over 16 hours, but I prefer the quicker ones. Any questions on this? You understand the little principle I'm trying to get to? It's not for everyone, okay? I'm an electronic guru. But for those of you who can use this, I at least want to communicate this to you. It is a good principle that can help you over a long period of storage. This is a nine-watt light for us. I forgot to show you. Nine watts giving you about 50 watts of equivalent illumination. This is what I prefer for you to have over this. See these little lights, the three watt, the nine watt I'm holding? Why are these better than this spiral one, even if this was lower wattage? What's good about these? Yeah, this is sensitive. This breaks easy. These have a plastic shell around them. See the curly? The curly cue is in there. There's a plastic shell around it, so when it travels in your luggage and you're traveling the world or you have children or over-anxious dogs, okay, it's got a high degree of resistance to it. Now, I actually just broke my shell probably bringing it here, but it's a lot better than this. It does stand. It's not super durable, but it does stand up to a lot more breakage than a regular fluorescent or even a regular bulb will. I'm losing my breath. Okay. One of the most important things for all of us to have. There's an old Chinese curse of may you live in interesting times. We are going to live in interesting times. We've had three emerging infections in two years. We've had $100 billion worth of economic and physical damage done to the continental United States by terrorists on 9/11. We've lost several thousand people. We have gone and invaded and conquered Afghanistan and Iraq and who knows what else, and there's people out there who totally, truly hate us. There are diseases out there that you have no concept of. There are diseases out there in vials, weaponized in hundreds of tons that can make the continental United States no longer the United States of America you and I know. So we are going to live in challenging times. The most important thing for us all to have is faith, not just faith in God, but faith in ourselves, faith in our friends, faith in our friends and neighbors, faith that when the worst happens it will bring out the best in all the people and in us, that your neighbors will become even closer to you and some of the best friends you've ever known. That's what happens in a crisis. That's what happens in a disaster. People come together. There are some bad elements out there that will challenge you, and they will have to be dealt with appropriately by the people who know how to do that or step up and take the responsibility to do so. So there are some riots. There are some people who take advantage of the bad situation and try to hurt you. But overall, 99.9% of the people, this is going to bring out the best in us and the best in them. We have to have faith in ourselves, have faith in our friends and our neighbors, and that we're all going to make it through whatever difficulties we're going to have. Okay, with that, that's it. Thank you very much. I'm going to go into questions and answers.  Here's what I did in cover for you. If you remember anything, please remember the faith message. So many people buy things and they hoard them. They don't tell anyone. I want you to show and tell people that you're doing this, that you think it's right, and you want to help them. Have faith. If you take anything away from this, have faith in your friends and your neighbors. That's what will get us through this. That's why I want you to come to my house when there's a disaster, because I want your talents. Are you a nurse? Are you a carpenter? Are you good with children? Do you have any other talents? Are you just a strong back? Are you just a hard worker? We're all stronger, the more of us that are together than we are independently. I have whole sections I could cover on medicines, stuff you didn't know, like Benadryl. What does Benadryl do? Benadryl is an anti-allergy medicine. It's an anti-shock medicine, an anti-irritant, an anti-itch. You can use it for sleep. It's a mild anti-nausea agent. It stops nasal drip from colds. It's a mild anti-cough and a mild anti-anxiety drug. I've got a whole section on meds I can go through. In fact, Dr. Cutt and I are doing a whole special thing on this medicine. I've got a whole section on SARS. You can go and listen to about SARS on my website, stevenharriff.net. I will tell you on there how SARS, monkeypox, anything else gets to you. It only gets to you. What are the routes of infection into the body? Eyes, nose, mouth, open cuts, and one or two other mucous membranes you might have on your body. Those are the only routes for infection into the body principally, okay? If you can wear a mask, cover up things that are cut, and wear goggles. All these people running around China, you see them wearing masks and gloves and gowns in hospitals. What's missing? They're not wearing goggles. The eyes are a primary route for infection to the body. I touch something here, cold, flu, I go like this, I'm infected, okay? I talk about that in detail in the audio on the site. You can download it and listen to it. You'll stream it to you live. It's a good class. There's a whole thing I can do on weapons of mass destruction. Some of it is covered in the SARS. The SARS audio talks about protecting the family from weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological. Basically, how do you survive a class 5 hurricane like Andrew barreling down on you? Same way you survive WMD. How do you survive a hurricane? No. Florida, they'll flood you out. The problem with hurricanes is the water comes in and floods you out. The tidal surge, 20 feet. How do you survive a hurricane with 200-mile-per-hour winds? Go to Miami. You be where it's not. Same thing with WMD. You be where it's not. That could be in a safe room in a house. That could be someplace else. You be where the disease is not. Being where it's not also means don't let it get to your eyes, nose, mouth, okay? That's being where it's not. Forget it. Forget it. You're dead. Almost for most of the stuff. I got a whole section on cold weather. I got a whole section on food I can do. Some of you had some specific questions in different of these areas. What are some of the specific questions in these areas that you'd like me to answer before we dismiss and all go home? Safe room. Safe room and medication. Duct tape and plastic. Not a joke. One of the best things there is, okay? You be where it's not. You have a chemical release outside. Basically, chemicals are going to come to you and get to you through inhalation, ingestion, or through your skin. What you're doing is you're making it harder for those chemicals to get to you. You're sealing up your room. The way you seal a room is you seal the windows and the air conditioners and the vents. What else do you seal in a room? What's the other primary entrance? Not just the door. Baseboards. Baseboards. You get two cards from that. I told you that. Baseboards. Where the carpet meets, okay? You tape that up. What you're doing is not going to be 100% effective. You're just reducing the amount of contaminant that could possibly get to you. It might have to snake its way down the chimney, come through a hallway, and get to you. But by the time it does that, it's going to be even more diluted, okay, for a biological or a chemical agent. That's what you do for safe rooms. What about the -- because I read it's a woman in Israel. She suffocated you from safe rooms. That's stupid. That's more provocative than even most of the people that the media did. You know how the woman suffocated in her room? In a stove or something that she had done. No kidding. She lit charcoal. She carbon monoxide-ed herself to death. Go close a room and light charcoal. You'd be dead, okay? So don't light charcoal.  Huh? Was that what happened with two cops? Yeah. Well, they could have either CO'd themselves to death or CO2. You can asphyxiate from -- you can poison yourself from carbon monoxide, or you can poison yourself from carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of any hydrocarbon combustion. Yeah, so, yeah, that could have happened to them that way. But with three people in the room, not a full force of -- Oh, believe me, start shooting stuff, and you'll be opening the door on your own, okay? How many days was that? Average person needs five gallons of air per minute, a cubic foot, 7.4 gallons. You need a little bit less than a cubic feet. We use three cubic feet per minute as standards in nuclear shelters. That's the minimum air flow we need because we remove body moisture and everything else. From an oxygen point of view, you need five gallons a minute. The trouble is you build up CO2. If I lock you in a bank vault, you don't die of oxygen deprivation. You die of carbon dioxide poisoning. You'll just actually -- you'll die of CO2 poisoning from your own breath before you die of oxygen deprivation. Houston, we have a problem. Houston, we have a problem. That's right. That's where they've been in Apollo 13. They had to get the zeolite filters going because zeolite is an absorbent for carbon dioxide. They would have died of their own CO2 before they died of oxygen deprivation. So what they did was remove CO2 from the air, make sure that the oxygen is going to be the limiting factor in killing them. Medications. Ladies asking about medications and storing them. You're going to have to buy them. You're going to have to get a doctor to overwrite a prescription for you. You're going to have to go buy them. It's like if you take two a day, you're going to have to have them change your prescription to four a day and go buy them and put them away. The best place to store medications is the freezer. You freeze them, most medications, and it will extend the shelf life dramatically. Most medicines are good well beyond the shelf date. There are exceptions. The doxycycline, tetracycline family of antibiotics become toxic to the kidney or liver after a certain period past their expiration date. There is an easily documented World Health Organization test to test for this to see if it has gone toxic or not, which you can do in your house. It's really pretty simple. Penicillin and other antibiotics just lose potency over time, and you slow that degradation by freezing them. So you're going to have to get more medicine. You can always go buy it. You can go to Canada and buy it. You can buy some of it off the Internet. You can have the doctor write your prescription. You can go to the pharmacy and pay that long dollar for it. Costco has cheaper medication prices. If your life is dependent upon a medication, you must have it, like high blood pressure medication. Stop taking your high blood pressure medication, or alternative to it, pretty much you're going to die. So you've got to get your medication. You've got to talk to your doctor about it. If your doctor does not want to address the issues, the doctor says you're stupid, you're crazy, it's not going to happen, kick him in the ass and leave and go find one that will take care of your health. You being concerned about your health or anyone else over one, two, three months in disaster is a medical issue. Your doctor damn well better address that medical issue with the same level of professionalism as if you come in with a broken arm. If you don't, you're dealing with a doctor who's not doing what he swore to do. Okay? But you've got to take care of it. It's very important. Any other questions? WMD, SARS, anything like that? Cold weather, food. Would you consider doing a cold weather like for our group? Yeah. Believe me, I can wear my stuff, which I didn't even pay $50 for, and I can stand out there in below zero weather doing traffic and be just fine. You know, these police officers seem to be a rite of passage saying, "Well, I was outside for eight hours and there was a minus 30 wind chill, and we froze our butts off." No need to. It's real easy not to freeze your butts off. Okay, we've got a bunch of cards here. Door prize time. Everyone make sure they've got their names on the cards. Throw the cards in here. It's like church. I'm not telling you what the prize is yet. Any cards? Where did you get this one at, Andy? $30 Target or Wal-Mart. Yeah, I like big lots the best. I'm a fair and impartial person. Young lady, would you please reach your hand into the -- and pick out a card and see who is the next person who's going to vote for Tim. The next person is the first winner of behind door number one. Where's Lisa? You win. Oh, what, you win. I am leaving for a tour of the west and the southwest on a one-month trip, 10,000 miles. You get to accompany me in my RV on the trip. Okay, no. Sure. You won. You won a week's worth of food. And you won one bonafide marathon emergency light with 2D cell batteries. This light will stay on for, guess how long? Four months. Two batteries in this thing will stay on for four months. So you have food for a week and light for four months. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Make sure my other stuff isn't in here. Wait a minute. I don't need tongs. You don't get the tongs, the butter knives. Look through there real quickly and make sure. Okay, you're dismissed. Thank you for coming very much. Any volunteers who want to help me? Oh, wait, speech, speech. Civilian emergency response team needs you. Okay, we need capable volunteers to help us in times of emergency and non-emergency. You will get first aid training, CPR training, automatic defibrillation training, traffic, weapons of mass destruction, hazardous materials, and work with some of the best people you've ever met. If you'd like to sign up, we've got the forms here. And I need someone to help me pack. Any other people with questions, feel free to come up and ask me. I need a volunteer to help me pack up and leave. Did I leave anything else in here? I don't think so. Does anybody need their certification? I'm leaving tomorrow or Saturday. So do you want the second part of your price? You know what? It was a joy listening to you tonight. You're always so serious and straight-faced. I wonder what is this going to be like for the staff here. Thank you. I'm glad I got the opportunity. And I'd love all of those. But because we have so many power outages and I have a heart disease and a pulmonary disease, I have a real hard time taking care of it. Oh, and pulmonary disease. Okay. You're going to have to address that medical issue. Yes. You're going to have to address it. I'm just going to tell you now, he takes around $900 to the hospital. Sam. So we can go over and see if he loves me or anything. No, Sam, that's it. That's all. I expect a report on what -- oh, never mind. Make sure there's nothing else in there of mine, okay? Yes, there is. I'll give it back. You'll give it back. Why? You're not a CERT member. They're not going to see you again. I filled out the form. Oh, she's back in class. She wants to come out. Oh, I'm your only student. No, I don't get paid for this. This is wonderful. This is excellent. I love it a lot. Very wonderful. Yeah. I mean, I would love to do the whole thing, especially the cold one with the cold light. And I think there should be a committee for it. Thank you. Well, I do too. There's a lot of things that I can do. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things. I can do a lot of things.</p></div></div></body></html>
