That went over the time a lot. That was wonderful. Thank you so much for coming. What a great, great session to end this. I mean, it, you know, our mission at the Bogle Center is to expand John Bogle's legacy by promoting the principles of successful investing and financial well-being through education and community.</p><p>I mean, nothing embodies it more than what you just did. Thank you so much for that. It was wonderful. Also, to thank people, if the volunteers could stand up, all the people who have volunteered, please stand up. Any local chapter coordinators out there? Local chapter coordinators? Forum monitors? Forum monitors can stand up, thank you.</p><p>Board members, any board members here? Former board members, Alan, Alan Roth, stand up. Gail, please stand up. Thank you all, and anybody else who has spread the word. Thank you all very much. We all greatly appreciate all of your help. Several people have already approached us to, you know, how they can help going forward.</p><p>And, of course, we need all types of people. And one thing I forgot to mention, because I had this conversation twice when I was in the hallway talking with people, are the visionaries, the visionaries. I mean, you have a vision for how you can create something within the Bogle Center.</p><p>We were talking about maybe a Bogleheads fire movement of some sort. I mean, whatever it is that you say, hey, we should have this, this would help. You know, I could help do that. And so not only are we looking for, you know, workers and volunteers and people to help with technology, we're looking for visionaries.</p><p>We're looking to grow this organization, not only in the United States, but around the world. So if you have a vision of where we might be able to go with this, and you are willing to take action on that vision, we certainly want to hear from you and certainly would like you to have that conversation.</p><p>So, okay, so now, actually eight minutes early, the moment you have all been waiting for. Not yet. >> All right. >> The moment hasn't arrived yet. Okay, this is the general location, not the exact location. But think of this as where we are, are in Chicago, but we're not really in Chicago, okay.</p><p>So when we pop this up on the screen of where the next Bogle Head Conference will be in 2023, it is the general location. And the general location is Christine. Washington, D.C., hey, mid-October. David Gravener, are you here, David, still? And there's going to be our local chapter coordinator who will be helping us pick the place and the time.</p><p>So, see you all there next year. That's it. Thank you very much for coming.</p></div></div></body></html>
