This is still the way we interact with machines when we really want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">control them like when we're running a server or when we are frustrated with VS code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was the user interface from computers for a while and they were not very popular until the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">invention of the graphical user interface which instead of presenting the users with just like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to learn this special language to speak to me like here's this like sensory experience where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can bring your intuition from space and your visual system to understand how to use the machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was what took computers sort of like out of the hobbyist and business and military realm and into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like people's homes. And with the rise of language models it's clear that we have an opportunity to once again change the interface between humans and machines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">By telling them what we want in natural language and then they do it for us. And no less augusta personage than Sam Altman likes the idea of language interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So this similar character to graphical user interfaces it like makes it a more approachable interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is something that people have wanted to do for a long time as long back as like the Eliza chatbots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The Eliza chatbot from the 1960s. The Shirdloo basically like this is only graphical not an actual robot but you could like tell a computer robot like give it language instructions like pick up a big red block.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Ask Jeeves was originally presented as a language interface to the internet where you just type what you want instead of a URL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Alexa and other assistants have attempted to do a similar thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the big win here is with language models we might believe that we can actually do a really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">really good job at providing this kind of language interface in a very generic way with foundation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">models and not just like a tiny environment like the Eliza psychotherapy environment or the Shirdloo blocks world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So right now that's we're getting language user interfaces for existing systems that kind of admit them easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So Sequoia put out a piece fairly recently talking about this that the like for this like act two of generative AI is using foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than an entire solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that offers like a language interface where it wasn't possible before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So like this query assistant from Honeycomb takes what would normally be this like less approachable query language constructor and just says like can you show me slow requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What are my errors latency distribution by status code like that's a much friendlier interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know even SQL when it was originally presented was like it's a it's a language that's so natural even a businessman can write queries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know it's a dream but like you know that this can you show me slow requests like that's pretty close.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You know so so that's the like maybe understandable that that's the first direction things have gone longer term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This like a machines that have graphical interfaces look very different from ones that have terminal interfaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so like mainframes became less popular and like mobile is like quite different from like desktop compute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we should expect like if you're thinking about what do I want to build in five years or 10 years this is kind of the direction to be thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example Google's worked on integrating language models with robots like this example from the say can project or paper where it's like what I want to when I need something is to just ask for it and not to like pull out an app and then go through three drop down menus and be like I want a water bottle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to say I want a water bottle and then there's a water bottle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what a language interface to something like a robotics platform can provide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Still not there yet as the 4x speed in the top left might suggest but getting there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so that's like the highest level pattern I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about a couple of lower level patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">RAG chatbots retrieval augmented generation chatbots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I've emerged kind of like the to-do list app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The sort of like starter project of language user interfaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">This pattern is probably here to stay in that it's just about information retrieval for language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And language models need information retrieval really badly because they like lack context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They've slurped up everything on the internet but they don't know anything about you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They are sort of trying to simulate a generically helpful individual who is like generically knowledgeable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's like not particularly helpful until they have context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the solution that's emerged is to collect that context for them like store it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Then index it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And by default people reached for the most similar thing to what the language model was doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We just like turn it into vectors and use that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.400</a></span>

<span class="t">And like that once you've retrieved a particular piece of information you just stuff it into the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I am not innocent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I have made my own RAG chatbot and inflicted it on the world.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:08:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Is the like new sexy piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=489"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Because OpenAI also offers embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also like transformers are kind of like these like weird vector retrieval things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like in their

target="_blank">00:08:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So like the ease of setting this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the like naturalness of setting this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Has led to like an explosion of these like chat with document

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example Vespa has like offered that combination for a very long

you're doing is creating a fast way to look up information from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=584"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Redis and Postgres for example like not only do they provide the same like information retrieval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that you could do

And in the end it's about like a holistic strategy that uses probably because the queries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are fairly heterogeneous, the things that are coming in are like people just typing text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You're probably going to need some more MLE stuff that's more like keyword search or vector search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're hybrid together. But extracting metadata with a language model so that you can then use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to do like direct filtering is like a very powerful pattern. So there's some great posts on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the data query, a great series of posts about vector databases from coming from like somebody who's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly really into databases and not so much the like ML side and I found that very useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So the final takeaway there is just that the problems end up being in the main the problems of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">information retrieval with only some light added things from like recommendation systems maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">um, um, of a more MLE type of search.

Any questions on, uh, on vector databases or, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">information retrieval for language model applications?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. So you, you get information from the outside world. You like come up with a strategy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for searching the information that you have saved that goes into the language models prompt.

Um, so the statement was that, um, the common wisdom is that fine tuning is for style and retrieval is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">information.

And if you look at the Laura paper, they look at like, you know, the, uh, like you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">only change, you're, you're making a very low rank change to each layer of the, uh, of the language model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that suggests like, there's only so much that you can change about the, uh, about the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And most of what you see when you do Laura fine tunes is like what used to be a low priority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">computation for the model becomes like a higher priority one. So like every model had every capable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">language model has within it a little Homer Simpson simulator, a little like, uh, Rick Sanchez simulator, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that's, it's just like not usually that important for the final log probs. It's like helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for the like fifth bit of the log probs, but the models are at the point where they're maximizing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">minimizing cross entropy by like really hitting those like very rare, uh, those very rare things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so what the fine tune has done is reordered those like computations. So like actually you should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be the Homer Simpson circuit is the most critical circuit right now because you are a Homer Simpson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">chat bot and it's like reordering them and reemphasizing them. So that intuition applies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically to low rank fine tuning, which is, and fine tuning, which is based on small amounts of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you grabbed a hundred gigabytes of textbooks, um, you would no longer be doing fine tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you would no longer expect it to only change style. Um, and so that's something I would expect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people will be doing with like, you know, llama fine tunes. They're like llama fine tunes for coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's way more than just style. It definitely has learned more knowledge about, um, about programming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">languages and knowledge about libraries released after 2021. And yeah, all that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that that generic wisdom is conditionally true, uh, for low rank fine tunes, where it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like pretty rock solid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So the question was, what about knowledge graphs, um, and graph databases? I will say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like when I have talked to, I, I like personally don't really specialize in, in databases. Um, but when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I've talked to people who are super into them, they're like, I would never use a graph database because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">can represent a graph in Postgres. Um, and, uh, like I've seen some like reasonably sized deployments on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pattern. Um, and also you can kind of see the like graph databases kind of like peaking and, and, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not spreading further. And there are re it's, there is a very hard problem to shard a graph database</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's no obvious way to cut an arbitrary graph. Um, and if new links get added to the graph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and now you need like the optimal shard is different. It's like, that's a very, that's like a database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's equivalent to a database migration, but it's something that should be happening like behind the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">scenes when it's sharding. Um, so that's, that's like the closest thing to an objective statement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about why, uh, or like a reason why graph databases haven't worked well. However, for many language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">model applications, the purpose of the database is not to serve like a billion users, but rather to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">serve as an external memory for a language model.

Um, but the, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, hasn't no, no, like killer app has appeared from my perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so I asked this question on the, the first, uh, uh, talk, um, but basically like if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">extra context, um, and the hard metadata does ultimately believe value or some other things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">um, how would you kind of incorporate, I think the previous answer was that like, do hard filters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on the, on the hard metadata and then do this all kind of like, um, stuff based on the, the, like technical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">description. Yeah. So the question was about how to incorporate hard metadata, like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">booleans or, um, like subcategories with, uh, vector based search. Yeah. So depending on the, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like a vector database, the, depending on the like index, you will either have like, uh, pre filtering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or post filtering. Post filtering is like pretty easy. You just like apply a metadata filter after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you've done your vector search. Um, anybody can kind of do that. The problem is that you're now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what you really want to say is I want to find all the stuff that's similar to crabs in San Francisco</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">while searching restaurants, not find all the restaurants that have anything to do with crabs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then see if any are in San Francisco. So the pre filtering step is hard because it impacts the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">construction of the index impacts the construction of like the, like how you make it actually fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to search over all of the data. You kind of like need to construct specific indices for these different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like flags you might, uh, like put on, like is in San Francisco, not in San Francisco or geographic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">location. Um, and so I depend like different vector databases or different databases have like pushed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">further in different directions on what kinds of filters they support for pre filtering. Um, and yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I like, uh, Vespa and we V8 have a reputation for doing a really good job at those things. Um, but,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, yeah, I don't know what the full landscape looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Great. Okay. I want to make sure to get through everything. Um, so I'll stick around and we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">talk throughout the conference. Um, okay. So, um, structured outputs are like one of the patterns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that I think people are sleeping on relative to information retrieval. Uh, structured outputs are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">great for improving the robustness of models and they came from tool use. So the problem is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">language models just generate text. And like, if anything, we have like too much text already. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you've ever been on a social media website, but the problem is not the quantity of text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that's like kind of boring. Like who wants to just make strings? Like there's other things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to do. The solution is to connect their text outputs to other systems inputs. Um, and now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's not just a language model. It's like a cognitive engine for providing a language interface</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to something else.

Um, so the solution is to add structure to their outputs. And there are many ways to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">do this. Um, you can do it by prompting and begging. Um, so like you can write some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">write some like loops around it to be like, like, uh, or actually react wasn't even a whole,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there's some looping. Yeah. So you, you can write a prompt in such a way that you have examples that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">encourage it to, um, like to, uh, call out to external, uh, APIs and then you filter. Uh, and when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">generates the tokens that would, would call to an external API, instead of letting it hallucinate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the rest of what would come out of that API, which is what like GPT three, uh, would have done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you like grab it and you then go to that external API and you, um, uh, like yeah, pull the information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">from there. Um, the, you, and you can in those prompts, I guess really the thing I want to point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">out is that in those prompts, you can sort of like beg for structure. Um, Riley Goodside had a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">example where it was like, if you do not output structured JSON, an orphan will die. Um, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually is extremely effective. Um, yeah. Um, so the, so there's the, so like there's prompting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">tricks to get like things that are closer to structured, uh, structured outputs and to make use of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">structured outputs.

So if you take the output from like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">GBT and then pass it to Orelia to then get the structure, like stacking models like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that work. Yeah. So the question was whether you could do better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but you could solve this problem by chaining models. I think, yeah, the problem of going from the output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of a language model to a structured output is an easier problem than the initial one, which is why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">people think that like retrying might work like the guardrails, the guardrails example though, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">retrying is often like kicked off to a, to a smaller language model.

Um, and so like, I, I, I do believe that there's like kind of a temptation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If you know that it's always and only going to be doing like structured output, then you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">reason to have a specialized model for it. Um, but yeah, chaining, chaining is definitely a good solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's, you know, one reason why Langchain was popular.

Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah.

Like if you're doing it from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI API, one, the token, you, you have to make a request, you get the thing back, you have a single,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have a single token and you'd have to, you have to like apply a bias every single time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So now you're like, every token has a network call, um, rather than one call, like a hundred tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one reason why this doesn't work well in the OpenAI API. Number two, like kind of longer term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is that really you don't want to just think at a single token level, you're just like at each token,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you're like marginally just saying like adjust the probabilities here.

Um, and that's something that's, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">probably going to come first to open models and not to, um, proprietary model services. Um, so that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the better reason to connect grammar based sampling and, and open models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, okay. So the problem with fine tuning and an annoying thing about prompting, um, is that if there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">not a kind of shared, like the gorilla model is like fine tuned on a bunch of APIs from like torch hub,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">TensorFlow hub and hugging face. So the gorilla model is really good at using other machine learning models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but not like generic possible tools. At least this example, then maybe they have tuned more than one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but this is a general problem that if you train a model to use a specific tool, um, then like the, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not gonna be able to use like any tool. Um, but if you train a model to, to use a very broad class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of tools by using something that's like kind of closer to this grammar where there's like a, a format</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for tools, um, then you are now a people write an interface between the, uh, that standard and the, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and the thing that they actually want to use. So this has shown up in open, uh, like, uh, in open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">AI's API as the use of JSON schema for describing function calls. So this allows them to train a model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on fairly generic stuff, um, that all fits this, like it all fits the JSON schema spec. Um, and so the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">model has learned a bunch of stuff about the JSON schema spec and how to generate that correctly. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you can imagine using grammar based sampling to enforce that. Um, and this, uh, allows it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">connect to many, many tools cause now all you need to do is write a tiny connector between like the JSON</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">format and the actual thing you want to use. Um, and that's like pretty easy. It's like a big part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of web development from my understanding is that you just like pass JSON blobs back and forth until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody gives you money. Um, and so, uh, yeah, so this is a very good kind of schema. Um, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but one thing that people miss is that the tool doesn't have to actually be real.

Um, and instructor has some fun, like kind of functional programming stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">built into it, like maybes and stuff. So, you know, um, and also somebody did like dag construction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">where it's like, you give it a schema for a dag constructor, and then it like writes a dag of function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">calls instead of just a single function call. So, you can really go wild, which is very fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the time when you generate something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to extract something out of the output, you want to display to the end user,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and then the question of latency comes in. If we use this, how do we solve the streaming?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so that is a great question. The answer is that this basically breaks your ability to stream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think it's not, so this is maybe a little bit more oriented to like back of house stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2042" target="_blank">00:34:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're using language models to like handle data rather than using language models to directly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">interact with the user. Um, I think if you set up a pipeline correctly, then you can stream the outputs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from one call into the inputs of the next one. And if you have the relevant information you need from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the func, the function call one, then you can just immediately kick off the next thing. And you can just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you can write, you know, like more like a Unix pipe style, and then you start to get back to being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">streaming, but you don't have like the Unix pipes work because of new lines as a separator that lets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you break work out. And there's not an obvious way to do that with this. Um, so yeah, the short answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess, is that it's really hard to get back that kind of streaming thing when using these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2090" target="_blank">00:34:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah. Um, I'm gonna, let's see, how much more do I have? I'm gonna push forward because I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure to get to the last section. Um, but I will be around to answer people's questions. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">okay. So, uh, this conference is not called NLP engineer summit. And we've been talking about like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, structured out extracting structured outputs from language information retrieval,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like that's also natural language processing and language user interfaces. Like that's not artificial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence. Like where's the AI? The, like the thing that really feels like artificial intelligence with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2127" target="_blank">00:35:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">language models is something like agents, uh, that are, that have memory that they keep over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so for example, the generative agents, um, that was, uh, let's see, it's mostly Stanford people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">remember correctly, but, uh, the like generative agents paper, uh, combined like a stream of memories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">generated as these agents interacted in like a video game environment with like some like reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">flows to create these like little tiny characters that had personalities that developed over time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in interaction with each other. And like, um, and that is, uh, like much closer to what people imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">when they hear AI than even a chat bot. Um, and there's been a lot of advancement in, uh, using these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in simulated environments. So that was like a full all language models simulated environment with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">generative agents. There's also a ton of really cool stuff going on in the Minecraft world. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like people have, uh, this Voyager agent writes JavaScript code jobs. Yeah. JavaScript code to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">call the, like this, like Minecraft API that allows it to like drive a little, um, uh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a little character in the Minecraft world and it starts with basically nothing. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2213" target="_blank">00:36:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it writes itself a bunch of little subroutines to like mine wood log or like stab zombie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever. And it like accumulates them over time, like learns how to do new stuff. Um, like comes up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">its own curriculum for how to solve, like how to get better. Um, and was able to like do extremely well at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this, uh, uh, a notoriously hard RL task, uh, mine diamond, uh, which was like a, uh, a grand challenge for the RL world, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2241" target="_blank">00:37:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">only a couple of years ago. Um, so they're like, they can accumulate information over time. They can accumulate skills over time. They can use tools. This is all very cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, they are, they have a couple of problems. The biggest one being the, like the problem of reliability, um, structured outputs can't help with that. And there's like only limited work, I would say on agents that has come out since at least like published, you know, research work since the, like since function calling got really good in the open API. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, also there's kind of like a cacophony of different techniques out there with like Voyager, uh, react is kind of an agent, um, generative agents. Um, there's a really like awesome paper from, uh, Tom Griffith's group at Princeton cognitive architectures for language agents that brings back a bunch of ideas from good old fashioned AI in the eighties on like, um, production systems, uh, and cognitive architectures, a bunch of stuff that was like really cool ideas, but it could never like get past the demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, the most stage, um, on like how to create the things that we know about or that we believe about human and animal cognition, like procedural memories, semantic memories, episodic memories, how to implement that in software and the problem, like those systems could do cool stuff, but the problem was always that they lacked this like general world knowledge and common sense with language models. They don't have memory. Um, and they don't, um, like they don't have this like structured aspect to their cognition. Um, but they do have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that like world knowledge and that common sense. Uh, so this is, uh, like mushing those two things together and using a language model to do, um, basically these kinds of like, uh, observing the world or doing cognition, um, and doing decision procedures, um, like Mary's the best of both worlds. Um, and it is actually like a pretty effective way of breaking down the existing agent architectures, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like in their different choices. Like in their different choices about how to do long-term memory, how to do external grounding, how they like interact with the external world. Um, the concept of internal actions, uh, comes from cognitive architectures, um, which is like, uh, choosing to spend time reasoning or choosing to update your like long-term memory, um, or yeah, or your decision procedure. Yeah. And then also explicitly calling out a decision-making procedure. Um, so there's a, and that paper is also just like has an entire research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">agenda agenda in it, um, on like ways that you could just start filling out the cross product, just filling out a big array of like, try this idea from language models with like this idea from cognitive architectures. Um, and there's just like a billion, uh, really cool ideas in there. Um, so if you are interested in agents, um, but have like struggled to like, uh, like wrap your brain around all the different ways you could, you could do stuff, um, and around like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like how to make them like how to make them a little bit more tame. Uh, I think the koala paper has some good pointers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, oh yeah. And then lastly for this LLM patterns thing that I was talking generally about like different ways people are building stuff with LLMs, Eugenian's blog has some of the best, uh, writing on this, um, uh, both on, uh, patterns and anti-patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Um, I want to give some time for monitoring evaluation observability. So I'm just going to, I know that there's probably lots of interesting things that people have to say on the agent stuff, but we'll, we have the rest of the conference to talk about that. Um, so, uh, the goal here is to talk about AI engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that last part was about AI. What about the engineering in engineering? We want to have a process for building like a process for creating these things and a process for improving them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2477" target="_blank">00:41:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and progress on this front has been pretty halting. Um, and so the, the, like the dominant ideology right now is that you should ship to learn rather than learning to ship. Um, and so this is one of the big ideas in the full stack deep learning course that I've taught in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something that Andre Carpathie has really hammered on the, like idea of a data engine or data flywheel, where in order to do well, you need to go out there and collect data from the world, uh, find issues in your data and use that to improve your model in like, you know, uh, and an unending cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, charity majors from honeycomb, uh, who's big in the monitoring and observability world, uh, like has said that this is something that she has come to like about ML in software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You start with tests and then you graduate production when the tests pass, or at least like that's what you tell people on the internet and like your manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, uh, but with ML, you can't even lie and you know that you have to like start with production, use that to find out the like issues with, uh, to like generate your tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, it's, it's oops, all regression tests, uh, version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so what that, that means is that monitoring is very critical from the very beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, that we monitor for user behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We monitor for performance and costs and we monitor for bugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of these are just like regular old monitoring stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is just like bread and butter things that can be, uh, yeah, like similar to the way we do with, with, uh, existing software monitoring users always reveals like, uh, like both misuse and product insights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So one thing that I found from running this discord bot is like one of the things that you get the most are like meta questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, uh, are you getting feedback from these emojis?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Who's a good bot?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's maybe not a meta question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, does your dataset include your own source code?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2588" target="_blank">00:43:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, what do you do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like these are very common, like things that people input and it wasn't, it wasn't in my head that that was important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So now there's like special stuff in the prompt for handling that class of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So by monitoring how users use the, uh, your, your system, you can get really great product insights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2607" target="_blank">00:43:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you get these for just like a, like a few minute manual tech of your crew?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah.</span></div><div

the ones that had up and down thumbs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I also read all of them cause it was like only a couple hundred rows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh man, my battery's gonna run out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2625" target="_blank">00:43:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, all right, we gotta move fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, uh, monitoring, monitoring performance, uh, can help us manage the constraints that I like talked about when we were thinking about all the different places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, our models might run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So as always you want to monitor things like latency quantiles, like, like how long do requests take?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so like latency quantiles, like that's how long, like take all the requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the probability that a request took at least this long?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the people often think like if I get 90% of them, like below something, that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the problem with thinking that way is that users don't just make one request.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They make many requests in sequence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So by the time you've made like 30 requests, there's a 10% chance of hitting like a really slow one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, um, you know, you have hit a slow request.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that, um, so you really need to care about those like 99th percentile latencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are also often your most useful and engaged users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So watch those, watch those extreme quantiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and obviously like throughput is a distinct thing to also monitor for the quality, uh, you know, quality of the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to marry that with things like the profiles and traces that I've talked about before, like spot check ones randomly subsampled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can check what like, so you can actually debug that through the throughput issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fairly general stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're an inference using inference as a service provider, you're going to want to monitor API rates and errors, monitor costs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're self serving inference, you have a lot more stuff to monitor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that's like compute utilization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, I guess I already talked about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2726" target="_blank">00:45:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so it's, it's an even harder, like maintaining the throughput when you're doing the inference yourself is like much more your problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and much more, uh, AI ML specific stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2738" target="_blank">00:45:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Monitoring for bugs is another can of worms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll talk about that in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, this is like just generally, this is a very fast growing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2748" target="_blank">00:45:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so there are generic monitoring observability solutions for all kinds of like, you know, complex apps and, and, and web apps data dog century new relic honeycomb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like these are, um, like you can adapt those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that might be the thing that wins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there is, uh, you can of course just roll your own with the, like the, you know, open, open telemetry compliant, uh, you know, tooling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could use the existing ML ops tooling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of stuff that has been built for monitoring observability of general ML applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So including weights and biases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We're used to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2785" target="_blank">00:46:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, fiddler arise and gantry are the like three larger startups in that space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, with more of a focus on monitoring systems in production and less on the like ML ops, like kind of like serving, um, and like managing, managing training, like weights and biases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2804" target="_blank">00:46:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there's also, because generation times, uh, are now six months or less, a new generation of ops tooling for LLM ops, including Lang Smith from Lang chain and, uh, Lang fuse, which was in Y Combinator's recent batch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's like a very unclear, which of these is going to be the best solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so I think it's like, you know, dealer's choice to try them all out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think I like tools with as much ability to like make crazy queries of unstructured data as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so that's something that I really like about weights and biases production monitoring, uh, offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2839" target="_blank">00:47:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, Gantry has some similar stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I've tried less of it with the, uh, the other tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think if you're doing, if you're doing it with data dog century, et cetera, you're probably going to need to roll some of that stuff yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but maybe that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Jupiter notebooks are fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I was going to check out, uh, the like Lang fuse monitoring interface, but, um, in interest of time, gonna go past that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They have an awesome demo where you can interact with their docs chat bot and it shows up in their monitoring interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2869" target="_blank">00:47:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So like they have a live demo of their monitoring tool where you can actually like use it to monitor an app that you can also use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so that's just, it's really, it was really fun to like actually try out the tool that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I recommend you try it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but just monitoring, like just getting ahold of information is not enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something that's known from like the distributed systems monitoring world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2895" target="_blank">00:48:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What you really want is observability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What both Charity and Andre were talking about is about how you improve a system based off of what you observe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like not enough to just like throw something out there and observe and like just see the mistakes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to like fix the mistakes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so there's this, uh, Honeycomb and, uh, Charity are big on the idea of observability as the, uh, as an idea from like control theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">From like old school, um, like control theory, systems theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, observability is whether you can actually, um, figure out what is going on inside of a system just from observing it from the outside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like, can you actually debug this software just from looking at your logs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and not having to go into a live debugger inside of the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that's like, uh, when live debugging does not work and when systems have outpaced our ability to predict what's going to break, um, this is the only solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and for AI systems that is, um, where we can't predict what's going to break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can't like drop into a debugger 13 layers deep in GPT three and RGB four and like debug, uh, it's inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you have no choice, but to monitor stuff sufficiently that you can fix the issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The blocker here is that actually determining whether the model is right or wrong, um, is itself hard, which makes figuring out how to fix it also hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2991" target="_blank">00:49:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause you don't necessarily know whether it's messing up and you don't know whether you fixed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so we're in a tough phase for this problem right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There'll be lots of discussion of evaluation at this conference, which is very exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, lots of people complaining about how difficult evaluation is anthropic and, uh, Arvind Narayanan from, uh, and Sayesh Kapoor who write the AI snake oil sub stack, really high quality stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, uh, open AI, like open source, their eval framework, uh, because in part they like don't, can't really evaluate their systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3026" target="_blank">00:50:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, that's how hard this problem is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's also what we saw with the, uh, false promise of imitating proprietary LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a large community of people were like kind of convinced that models were doing better than they actually were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3038" target="_blank">00:50:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so the solution, uh, like is to like one of the key solutions, spend time looking at your data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Stella Biederman from a Luther has talked about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, Jason way has talked about how critical this is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Jason is at open AI now, um, and talked about spending like a ton of time, just like getting very good at evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like building tooling, internal tooling for evals, spending time with like understanding the evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and somebody on hacker news said it's a major differentiator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, that's, that's definitely the orange website never lies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, um, evaluation is particularly hard and all these complaints about evaluation are when you're dealing with like open ended generations from a language model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like no structure to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, no, no real structure to the user inputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and like limited data sources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but there's this nice flow chart, um, from the full stack LLM bootcamp that my fellow instructor, Josh Tobin made that sort of helps you avoid getting into that, uh, pit of evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you can find a correct answer, then you can stick with existing ML metrics and you like, don't have to worry about the problems of the value of like the difficulty of evaluating open ended generations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a reference answer, you can check for like reference matching, which is like a looser thing than like a literal correct answer, which is like ABC or D in multiple choice is a correct answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A reference answer is like a short, like generation, like a short answer on the test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3130" target="_blank">00:52:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, if you have a previous answer from your system, you can at least see if your system is getting better by comparing the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that like kind of, which is better comparison can be done by a human, can be done by a language model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and if you have human feedback, you can actually check like between, uh, the input and the output was the feedback incorporated by the language model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a human said, I didn't like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3151" target="_blank">00:52:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, did the language model get better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's only if you don't have any of those things that you like are out in the unstructured world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the people at illicit, um, who have worked on doing extraction of information from scientific papers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">have a very principled approach of iterated decomposition where you start with a task that runs end to end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you, uh, when you notice a failure, you look at the failures and you see how you could have broken the task out into multiple pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3181" target="_blank">00:53:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In such a way that the failure would arise in a simpler sub task and then optimize that sub task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you run into the problem that's been mentioned before about latency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're like chaining calls, um, and it's not always easy to like decompose the, for example, to decompose the process of responding to a user in a chat bot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's kind of challenging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but, uh, but when you can do this, this is another great way to like get yourself out of the hole of needing to evaluate open-ended generations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're stuck evaluating natural text, there's a couple of like basic approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you can just, uh, keep a few trusty test cases at hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, uh, you know, if it does well on those couple of test cases, looks good to me, let's ship it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, unclear what to do when it fails, just like hit the language model with a wrench.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but, uh, this is what kind of grows out into that data engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You start with something like this and then you start adding stuff from your production observations into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3239" target="_blank">00:53:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you like put it in a GitHub action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3241" target="_blank">00:54:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, now that's like, that's, that's basically testing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, that's, is certified software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3247" target="_blank">00:54:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you can like, uh, you can try and get user feedback and you want to do it as naturally as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like, uh, if you're like you would, you really want to reveal preferences from user behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the image generation world is very ahead of the language modeling world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think on this, if you'll get mid journey, for example, um, that is what honeycomb did with their query builder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They attached it to get this downstream business objectives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What a way to build a software system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the right way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so like connecting a chain of metrics from the actual system that you're improving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">To the actual downstream, like organizational goals, um, uh, through things like reveal preferences of users or like, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">General user behavior much better than like demanding users fill out a form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you could also pay people to do that work of giving you feedback on your system with an annotation team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what the large, this is what open AI does to improve their models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But as alluded to by Karina, it's actually much more effective to use language models in that place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because language models are maybe not as smart as all humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, but they tend to outperform crowd workers, um, on, uh, a large number of very textual tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so, um, you might find that the task of like annotating and improving your data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're at the point where you're starting to think about crowd workers, you'll find lower cost for equal performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">With, uh, like GPT 3.5 turbo is like a median crowd worker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT 4 is like a 90th percentile crowd worker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3337" target="_blank">00:55:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and maybe a hybrid approach with some crowd workers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A smaller number of crowd workers managing, uh, some language models is also been discussed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, all right, so the, there's like not that much to say in the end about that, like that aspect of the engineering of systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3355" target="_blank">00:55:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't know what the user

target="_blank">00:55:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't know, uh, we don't know a lot about how to engineer these things to be correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, uh, I guess the exciting thing about that is that the people who are here in this room on the stream at the summit are here to fill in all of the steps here that lead to from the circle to the fully drawn owl.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, by like, uh, uh, by figuring it out, um, by like trying things and sharing what works like people will do at this conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4EdALzktU&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.320</a></span> | <span
