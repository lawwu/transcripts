But if it's all about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29JjnZ3yhk&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sheer scale of data and compute, you'd expect the leaders to be increasingly, well, Meta and Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29JjnZ3yhk&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is more or less what we're seeing though of course measuring that intelligence is quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29JjnZ3yhk&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hard.

If we just relied on these Elo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29JjnZ3yhk&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">rankings, you'd think, well, if OpenAI can come up with a tiny model doing almost as good as the rest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29JjnZ3yhk&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they must be doing amazingly.

And I looked through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29JjnZ3yhk&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the dozens of examples and one trend emerged. Claw 3.5 Sonnet essentially refused more requests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29JjnZ3yhk&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">than GPT-40 Mini. Even when both models couldn't perform a task like creating an image natively,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29JjnZ3yhk&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT-40 Mini gave it, I guess, more of a go.
