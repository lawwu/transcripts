So let me just set the context though, like why I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">writing about that was I was finishing up academic work, right?

It's like, okay, I want to make sure I really understand this question of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people love their work. So that's what motivated the book. So I look in the question, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">answer that comes up everywhere back then at least was follow your passion, right? So I look into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that, like, okay, so why do we think this is true? The whole thing is nonsense, right? We think this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is some wisdom that Plato wrote about and then Thomas Aquinas then talked about and the founding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">fathers and it's this old piece of advice. No, if you go back and look at the etymology, the phrase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">follow your passion is from the early 1990s. Oh, wow. Okay. It's like a very new idea, right? This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">was not the way we thought about careers. I was the first generation because I went through school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the 90s, graduated, went to college at like 2000, right? I was the first generation to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">told this. So it's not ancient advice, right? In fact, ancient advice is much more different about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">how to actually build a life of meaning or do work of meaning, right? So the advice was new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I looked at a little further. Do we have scientific evidence that says, yeah, when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">match a pre-existing inclination with your occupation, you're happier? No, none of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">research exists. What does exist if you study the research literature on job satisfaction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is way more general traits. Like, do I have autonomy? Do I have a sense of mastery in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">work? Am I connected to other people in my work? Do I feel like my work is important? And none of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">these have to do with matching your job to a really specific passion. So then I said, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">why is everyone giving this advice? And so I started tracking down the backstories of famous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">people who had famously said, follow your passion. Nine times out of 10, it's not what they did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? They stumbled into whatever they ended up doing and it transformed into a passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So all this evidence came together and I said, this is nonsense. Passion is great. You don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">start with it. You're probably not wired for a particular job that happens to exist in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">21st century knowledge economy. There's probably not a gene that you inherited that said you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">meant to be a brand manager for like an athletic apparel company based out of whatever, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's not how you end up passionate about your work. You cultivate passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more I looked into it, the more it became clear. You get good at something as you get better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">at something, you get more control over your life and your career, and then you got to take that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">control for a spin. And that's when you really begin crafting your working life over time into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something that really resonates, right? So the passion is cultivated. The passion is grown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to end up passionate about your work, but if you're 22 and saying, let me figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">now what I'm supposed to do. And if I just figure that out and match that to my job, I'll be happy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">from here on out. It's a Disney fairy tale. - What about natural inclinations in the sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that visionary versus operator or systems people versus big idea people, that sort of idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">where does that fit into this thing around passion? - It matters, right? Because ultimately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what you're trying to do is if you get good at something, you get control. So you want to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what advantages do I already have pushing me towards getting good at something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you've already been training for something, well, let's keep that in mind because I've already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">done a lot of work for this. If you feel like you have an inclination towards a certain type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, you're very technical. Okay, it's probably going to be easier for you to get really good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">something in a technical field, right? Maybe you have some sort of family connection to whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, let's not ignore that, right? I mean, whatever is going to get me quicker towards being good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">something that's valuable is what I want to care about. So what I often say, it's about lowering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the threshold, right? So follow your passion. The threshold is find your one true passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you miss, you're screwed, right? I'm lowering the threshold to, there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">things you could probably cultivate into a really passionate professional life. There's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things, not everything for sure, right? But there's probably a lot of things. The hard part's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">finding one of those things. It's what you do once you choose it. It's the work you do for the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">10 years. So, you know, I'm not throwing a dart at a job listing board and saying, I guess that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm going to do. But I'm also not super fretting that if I don't make this choice exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right, I'm going to be in trouble. If it's like, this seems interesting to me, I have an inclination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for this. It looks like there would be a lot of flexibility and opportunities if I got good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this. Be like, that's good enough. That's good enough. Now let's do the hard work of actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">cultivating passion here. Nice. Okay. So, yeah. So the first book of yours I read was So Good They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Can't Ignore You and very much vibed with the message. And then the next book of yours I read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">was Deep Work, where it seems like so many people that that word has really seeped into the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And do you have a sense of how many people know that you originated that word versus it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">part of English vocabulary now? Oh, that's a good question. I mean, that was my goal for sure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is I wanted that piece of vocabulary to spread. Because my thought was more important than any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">particular piece of advice was just people separating deep work from non-deep work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And once you recognize deep work is very important, then people can kind of figure out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, I'm not doing a lot about this.

It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">shows up in weird places. There's a menu somewhere in Microsoft Outlook where it's not a deep work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">option, but there's a little explanation for like a focus mode option. And it says to support deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">work. So it's kind of floating around in there. I don't know if I haven't got my royalty check on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that yet. I do hear people say it. People often attribute it to me. I mean, here's the thing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that book. It came out quiet, right? Like I published that book, super disappointed. It just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it didn't have a lot of buzz around it when it came out. They had lowered my advance for that book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">versus so good. They can't ignore you because like, no, it's so good. They can know you didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">do great at the time. Uh, and so they had lowered the advance. The book came out. I was, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking because I, I didn't understand publishing back then. Right. So what I knew was, I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a killer idea. So why is this not being promoted everywhere and spread everywhere? And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, my agent sat me down and was like, that's not how it works. It's what did your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">last book do? Like, that's, what's going to matter in your last book. Didn't it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">take off right away? So like, they're not going to put as much into this. And because I was really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">upset. I had a friend who his family went to pick it up from a bookstore and they're not even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">carrying it on publication week. Right. I was like, I'm kind of down with this. And then quietly in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the background at some point, they're like, you know, this is kind of selling, never on a best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">seller list has never been on a bestseller list. Like this is just kind of selling. Oh, it's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of selling. Oh, then more people were talking about it. And then more people were inviting me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to come on their podcast. And it was just this really interesting slow burn where there was no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one point where I realized like, oh, this book is doing really well. But I look back now, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thing's closing in on like 2 million copies. Oh, nice. Yeah. It's just, it's been out there without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">ever having been on a bestseller list. Yeah. Yeah. And I imagine the people who have read the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are like a zillion X lower than the people who use the word and know what the word means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's probably true. That's probably true. Yeah. You know, the most interesting person I heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">use it was on the Tim Ferriss podcast years ago, Jamie Foxx. I'm sure he has no idea who I am,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or that I wrote it, but I was like, okay, my work here is done. So, um, being able to cultivate time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for deep focus work. This is something I struggle with. You and I are vaguely in similar sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">careers, sort of, you've got the academic thing going. I sort of have the business thing, I guess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on the side, which keeps occupied some percentage of our time. Really, I guess one thing I often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">think is, oh man, I wish I had more time in my life for deep work. Yeah. Um, any, any tips for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what you know about me and this, this career that we're both in? Yeah. Or maybe a slower</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">definition of productivity. See what I did there? I'm connecting it. I'm connecting it back to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">work. I mean, I think to me, and this is the research that kind of went into the slow productivity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, overload is the, the, the key villain here. Right. So like every active project that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">working on is going to necessarily bring with it overhead, right? Like we have to talk about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to have meetings about it. We have to have emails about it, which isn't bad. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">projects require collaboration. I'm more and more realizing the problem then is when we aggregate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">too many of those projects because all that overhead adds up. Right. So if there's six</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">different active projects going on, it's really, really difficult to find time for deep work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's six projects worth of administrative overhead that all just overlap now. Right. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's all, all competing for the same time. So I've really never found a better general solution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">than reducing the number of things that I'm working on, which I'm like you. I mean, I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I have so many interesting ideas and opportunities. And so I don't know if you do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I go cyclical, right? So I'll, I'll, I'll have a bunch of ideas and I'll start doing things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I get really overloaded. Like, this is not good. I can't do deep work anymore. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I really scale back and then I get bored and then I start like adding things back. And so my last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">overload was pandemic. Right. So like pandemic hits, I start to get kind of in a entrepreneurial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hustle mode because look, I'm a professor and a writer. Right. In those early months of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pandemic, it was, are the universities going to shut down? Like, I mean, they were, we have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">freeze parts of your pay. It's because the money wasn't coming in. And then at the same time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there's all these rumors that the publishing industry was going to start clawing back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">advances and like slashing and that, you know, Barnes and Noble was going to go out of business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and all this type of stuff. And so I went into a mode of, I got to get more irons in the fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I got a whatever. And then you fast forward a year and a half. And I'm like, Oh no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like I have too much. I can't the overhead. So that's the killer. The projects are awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the overhead that comes with the projects that adds up. So you either reduce the number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of projects or you find a way with the projects you have, you have to be really careful about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">controlling that admin overhead. This is when we talk about it. This is the processes for like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">where the information goes. Like you have to liberate those projects from just send me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">message when you need something. Let's just have a ad hoc back and forth communication to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things out. So you either have to get super structured or you have to simplify. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. There was a time I think last year before your book had come out, you had done a casual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">episode on Tim Ferriss. I mean, to the degree that any episode on Tim Ferriss is casual, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like the book hadn't quite come out and you were like exploring the idea of slow productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And you mentioned this overhead thing and it sort of clicked something in me where I realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like in physics, you know, like parallel versus series circuits. It's like you assume a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">parallel circuit is actually better because like, Oh, if I have these three things, then doing them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all three at the same time, the whole like consistency thing, you know, I thought that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the best way to write a book is work on it a little bit each day. And if you work on the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit each day and work on your YouTube videos a little bit each day and work on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">business a little bit each day, surely everything gets done. Yeah. No, it doesn't. Like basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">zero gets done. And instead of what I found super helpful was doing things in series rather than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">parallel. Yep. This week I'm just going to intensely focus on just the book and then I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to forget about it. And the next week is going to, I'm going to batch from some YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">videos. And then next week I'm going to work on the product and then go back to the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And even that, it was sort of felt annoying because I, what I really wanted to do was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to not make YouTube videos until I finished this book. But then the business would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have died. And so it's like, I've been trying over time to figure out what is the absolute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">minimum? Well, what's the, what, what is the minimum number of the maximum number of projects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that I have to have going at any one time and how do I just limit it to those things? So once I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">one thing, then I move on. Yeah. Well, actually that's, that's a really good strategy. I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">actually just talking about something like this at the event I was at before this, because I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to actually a corporate crowd who had a lot of work. They tend to have a lot of work put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on their plate. They couldn't say no to. So it's an interesting case. So what do we do about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I was advising they do is I said, okay, so you have this list of things you have to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">write them down. Now let's put at the head of the list, a small section that we call active. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, okay, these are the things I'm actively working on right now. Everything else let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sort and call that waiting. And what you're going to tell everyone and what you're going to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is only work on the active things. Right. And that means like that's what you're sending emails about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">having meetings about. If it's not on the active list, you're not, you're not dealing with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you finish an active thing, you can pull something else from the waiting list to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something new. So you only have one to three active things. Right. And I said, look, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">works really well because you're only generating admin overhead from a small number of things. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you've agreed to all these things, but you've, you've neutralized the admin overhead. Also be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">super transparent about this. I told him, put it in a Google doc and show everybody, here's your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. It's position seven. And like, as soon as it gets pulled in the active, I will let you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, I'm all in on this right now. Like call me. This is what I'm doing this week. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">let's get into it. Like, let's get this done. Like people know you have your act together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then they asked like, well, what about, we have really big projects sometimes. Like it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take a whole year. And the answer was, yeah, you have to break it into these smaller</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">things and use these smaller chunks with the same method. I think that's what you were doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And it's not, you're right. It's not great in the sense that it's not what your mind wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to do because it's not really the right way is what you said probably. And by right way, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the human brain as evolved, right. It's probably, I'm obsessed about this book till it's done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm obsessed with making these YouTube videos until like the season is over or whatever. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that's probably the right way to do it. But taking a chunk, one chunk at a time and just doing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">chunk, that's sort of like the best compromise because at the very least during that week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not in the impossible micro situation of having to jump back and forth between 10 things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And because it's just impossible. Yeah. The macro switching is still frustrating,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but at least the work gets done. But yes, that's a little, I mean, I feel the same way. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">all I want to do when I write is just write. And I can get away with about three months of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I take the summers. So like I can do about three months of just writing and nothing else,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but I need more than three months to finish a book. So like, I'm happy for three months of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">my book writing. Yeah. How are you thinking of that in relation to your podcast now? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess the, the, the YouTube channel, which seems to be blowing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So the podcast gets a half day a week. That was the, that was the, the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the agreement I made with myself when I finally started a podcast in 2020 was it gets a half day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a week. So to develop it, it's going to be slow. It's like slow productivity. It's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">slow because I have to figure out what I'm doing, you know, get good at what I'm doing first before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I can do something else. And if I want to, if I want to add more, it has to fit within a half a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">week. Right. So for me, that meant it starts simpler. And then I finally could make enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">money from advertisements to have a producer and now the producer can take these things off my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">plate. So now I can spend more time on that. And then finally we're like, okay, we can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to do video, but it's got to fit within a half day a week. Okay. How are we going to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this? Well, we're going to have to set up this video rig and here's the people who are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to work on it. And here's the pipeline. And I don't ever want to see a video editing piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of software or anything ever. Right. We have this pipeline figured out. And it's, we, we can't do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">X, Y, or Z for video, which would be better for the YouTube channel, because that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">take too much time. So what we can do is take the video straight from the podcast and put it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">out there. And then over time we're like, you know, YouTube doesn't really love that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, okay, we were able to bring on someone now who can work on the video produced by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast and figure out how to like, where did start and what thumbnail to put on. But all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it was slow because the podcast couldn't get more than a half day a week. So I treat the podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">more like a service obligation as opposed to a one-time project I'm trying to do. And I treat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">those two things differently because I'm always going to be doing the podcast. So now I have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">really contain it and understand it and control its footprint so that it cannot expand beyond that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">footprint. But like a book chapter is different. It's like, I got to get this done. It's best that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I just focus on this as hard as I can until it's finished. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. I've landed on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">similar conclusion with my YouTube channel in that it gets one day a week. Yeah. So fascinating. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So most Wednesdays, except today where it's tomorrow. So tomorrow is filming day all day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">where Tintin, our producer will come in in the morning at 9am with a coffee and we'll chat shit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for about an hour and then we'll film a video and the video will be prepped there. And then he will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">he will have rocked up with some title and thumbnail ideas. We may have some research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that a researcher has done, but broadly I'll sit down with a title that's given to me. I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, how would I teach this topic? Yeah. And then I draw some stuff on a whiteboard or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I hit record and I talk. Yeah. Then we go out for lunch and we'll come back and we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">another video and we get two videos done in a day and it's a really fun day. It's fairly chill. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the YouTube channel is like still growing with the, with that method. This is the opposite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of Mr. Beast. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's like, I'm going to spend the next month building some crazy thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I, by the way, I love the same day prep. I do the same thing. Right. I think there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of energy in it. Yeah. It's like, like I vaguely have an idea of like, here's a topic we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to do, but yeah, come in. I go to my studio and it's like, let's prep. It takes like 90 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, my, my producer pulls the questions and stuff like that. And, but yeah, I love the energy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of let's figure out what we're going to say. Ooh, this is good. Press play. Like let's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">let's like write it with it. Okay. But I'm assuming it took you, I mean, you, you've probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">evolved this whole process over time, right? Like someone, if they were new to making YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">videos, couldn't jump straight into this process. I'm assuming you figured out what's the pipeline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like who needs to edit, what, what type of things work, what prep matters, what prep has been a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">waste of time. It's that like evolution. I'm assuming we've run the entire gamut all the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from me spending five days, seven days a week working on YouTube videos and word for word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQxK4vusAE&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">writing scripts, bullet points.

This is kind of the key point is, uh, yeah.
