It's the membership that everyone seems to have. The quality of Priority Pass lounges is just so variable. Now, Priority Pass has actually changed quite a lot over the years. It used to be back in the day that any Priority Pass issued through a credit card could get you to basically any Priority Pass lounge.</p><p>And then they started adding restaurants and spas and other experiences. And then over time, credit card companies started taking away those experiences. So Amex was the first one to remove it. So you can't use an Amex Cards Priority Pass for restaurants anymore. Chase removed it recently too. Capital One removed it on most of their cards recently.</p><p>There's very few cards now that will get you into Priority Pass restaurants and spas, but sometimes those are my favorite ones to go to.</p></div></div></body></html>
