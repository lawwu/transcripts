I want to give you a short summary of my 2019 book, Digital Minimalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=12" target="_blank">00:00:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll start with the inspiration for writing this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I had begun to notice around 2016-2017 that people were becoming increasingly uneasy about their relationship with their phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The real issue they were having was how much time they were spending looking at these stupid things and how it was making them feel after they came out of those sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So people were getting uneasy about this. They were spending too much time. They didn't like how the phone was making them feel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So right around 2016-2017, people began trying to actually solve this problem. And there's two real responses that people have tried since then, both of which I'm going to argue are not enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing people tried was to detox. We heard this term used all the time when it came to digital lifestyle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This idea that I'm looking at this too much, so what I need to do is just get away from this. I just need to white knuckle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No more Instagram. No more TikTok. No more Twitter. No more phone. Let's just not read that phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they would see it over there, and they would just try to prevent themselves, clench up and prevent themselves from grabbing the phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know what? It rarely worked. Because it would still be sitting there. There'd be something they'd want to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So why don't I just check it one more time? And they look a little bit, and then a lot more, and then the phone is back into their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other response to this increasing uneasiness about our technology use was the delusion that we could fix it by fixing the programs, by fixing the apps, by fixing the phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That yes, I'm using this too much. It's making me unhappy, but we can correct this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we just had slightly better content moderation on Twitter, if we kept the wrong people from saying the wrong things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it would go back to being something that doesn't make me feel incredibly stressed out and emotionally nervous and innervated by just looking at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we just got the rules just right, if I just had the right app on my phone that showed me a tree every time I turned it on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I could see the tree get bigger if I waited more time, then I would change my habits, and I would stop using the phone so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had this delusion response that yes, this phone is causing trouble, but we can fix it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The tech is just a little bit flawed, so with a couple more tweaks, this will work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, this response did not solve our uneasiness as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've tried everything for years, and we still keep coming back to the phones. The phone still makes us unhappy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's going on? Why did those responses not work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the big arguments I make in my book is that they are too well engineered to capture our attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This has become more well known in recent years, especially with documentaries like The Social Dilemma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But back when I was writing this book, this was less well known.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The amount of energy and money that was invested in trying to make it nearly impossibly compelling to stare down at this little glowing piece of glass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of this had to do with the interface design itself, the colors that were used in the notification and alert badges,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the satisfying feel of an infinite scroll, or a slot machine style refresh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a new tweet?

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To focus on the advantages and to get away from the hidden traps.</span></div><div
