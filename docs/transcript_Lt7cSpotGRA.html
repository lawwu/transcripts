If you could go back and relive a single moment in your life, what would that moment be? There are moments in my life when I think about what could be done differently. No, experience happiness and joy and pride, just to touch once again. I made many mistakes in my life, so I know that. At the end of the day, I believe in the butterfly effect. I knew moments where I could... Now if I'm there at that point in '89, in '93, pick up a year, I could improve my actions by not doing this stupid thing. But then how do you know that I will have all other accomplishments? I'm afraid that we just have to just follow this, if you may call it wisdom, or forest gump. My life is a box of chocolate and you don't know what's inside, but you have to go one by one. I'm happy with who I am and where I am today. I am very proud, not only with my chess accomplishments, but that I made this transition. Since I left chess, I built my own reputation that had some influence on the game of chess, but it's not directly derived from the game. I'm grateful for my wife who helped me to build this life. We actually married in 2005. It was my third marriage, that's why I said I made mistakes in my life. By the way, I'm close with two kids from my previous marriages. I managed to balance my life. Here I live in New York, so we have our two kids born here in New York. It's new life and it's busy. Sometimes I wish I could limit my engagement in many other things that are still taking time and energy, but life is exciting. As long as I can feel that I have energy, I have strength, I have passion to make the difference, I'm happy.</p></div></body></html>
