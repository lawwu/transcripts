If you could go back and relive a single moment in your life, what would that moment be? There are moments in my life when I think about what could be done differently.</p><p>No, experience happiness and joy and pride, just to touch once again. I made many mistakes in my life, so I know that. At the end of the day, I believe in the butterfly effect. I knew moments where I could... Now if I'm there at that point in '89, in '93, pick up a year, I could improve my actions by not doing this stupid thing.</p><p>But then how do you know that I will have all other accomplishments? I'm afraid that we just have to just follow this, if you may call it wisdom, or forest gump. My life is a box of chocolate and you don't know what's inside, but you have to go one by one.</p><p>I'm happy with who I am and where I am today. I am very proud, not only with my chess accomplishments, but that I made this transition. Since I left chess, I built my own reputation that had some influence on the game of chess, but it's not directly derived from the game.</p><p>I'm grateful for my wife who helped me to build this life. We actually married in 2005. It was my third marriage, that's why I said I made mistakes in my life. By the way, I'm close with two kids from my previous marriages. I managed to balance my life. Here I live in New York, so we have our two kids born here in New York.</p><p>It's new life and it's busy. Sometimes I wish I could limit my engagement in many other things that are still taking time and energy, but life is exciting. As long as I can feel that I have energy, I have strength, I have passion to make the difference, I'm happy.</p></div></div></body></html>
