Harvard-Princeton or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">something. Two schools that are not very good at football. Let me put it that way. And the crowds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from each side were asked, "What happened in this football game?" And both of them had radically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">different opinions about the referees and the integrity of the players. And that's exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens with these couples. So we start there, and then from there, we expand the conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And in over, I think almost 100 conversations you probably had, if not more, what's changed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you evolved your thinking of how to have these conversations or what people should do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or how people should act?

There was a person on there who was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">saying some things that I really, really did not agree with. And I actually lost my temper. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">apologized in the episode because that's not cool. I've become a lot calmer because I've seen so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">much. So that's number one. Two, I can read things that are beneath the surface. You ever listen to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Loveline back in the day with Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew?

And it seemed like magic, but now I can understand it. So for example, there are little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">verbal and behavioral tells that we all have that tell us a lot about money.

Again, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tells you a lot about the socioeconomic way they grew up and how they view money. So there's class,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there's gender, there's a lot of different things that come to play.

A lot of us think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">about a healthy relationship with food or a healthy relationship with our partner or our kids,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but we don't usually think about a healthy relationship with money. We just think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">money as this thing that's always been, for example, guilt-inducing or anxiety-inducing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and we don't realize that there's actually another way to live. So sometimes it's just asking people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what would it look like to feel good about money? And they're just stuck. They never thought of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that. They never even realized that they were feeling bad consistently. And so for them to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">even think about feeling good is totally foreign, but they could do it. Intuitively, all of us know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what it would feel like. They start by saying what they wouldn't do. "Well, I wouldn't worry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't agonize over buying a pack of gum."

I go, "Okay, now tell me what you would do." And that is much harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So part of the premise is to help people start to rewrite the next chapter of their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Oftentimes, the same money beliefs we grew up with, I call them invisible scripts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are the ones we carry into our 20s, 30s, even 40s. Things like our parents saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"We can't afford it."

Let's talk about it. So what, Chris, is the thing that you love to spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">money on? Very few things, but I do like food. Food. Okay, great. And what do you love about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think especially right now in a world with young kids where travel isn't what it used to be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We used to... I mean, at one point, we quit our jobs and we just backpacked for eight months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just not an option with two small kids.

I get so excited when a new cuisine or a new place opens up. It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">"I want to do that because we're getting a little bit of that cultural experience while we can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">travel." So that's something right now I feel like I'm willing to spend money on. Okay, love it. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's your money dial. Food.

Three is health</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and wellness.

And then there's many other money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">dials. Now, my second question, and the reason I call it a money dial, which you can turn up or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">turn down, is Chris, if you could quadruple the amount you spend on eating out, what would it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">look like and what would it feel like? Before you answer, everybody listening and watching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to do this with us.

So that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Chris, is how I start off, really help people create their vision, is to find out what they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">already excited about and then ask them themselves to articulate what turning that dial up would look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like. And do you also ask them what you would turn the dial down on? Yeah, but not till way later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I want them to get super excited.

We just did an episode on Italy. So much good feedback. Go back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and listen if you haven't. It's like a gimme. It's like a comedian making a fart joke. You're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay." You know you're going to get that response. By the way, I'm not equating Italy to a fart joke,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but I am saying whenever you talk about Italy, everyone's got a big smile. Hell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we even took our parents as part of our honeymoon to Italy because we know everybody loves it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So people go, "I love to travel." I go, "Where would you like to travel?" And they just go like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, I just like to go anywhere." I go, "Uh-uh.

I force them to get specific. And so we end up with them saying, "I want to drink Italian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">wine, watch the sunset in Rome and be staying where we can see the Colosseum." I go, "Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that is a beautiful vision. That is really specific. And my final question, who would you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">take with you?" So suddenly, they've articulated, they can almost smell it, right? Now that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">have that vision, I take a look at their numbers. And everyone is required to submit all of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers to me so I can see their net worth, income, debt, everything. And you can see it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">too. I pop it up on screen. Can you imagine being able to see a couple who overspends by $4,000 a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">month every month and they didn't even know it? That happens on the pod. Or a couple who's got a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">net worth of like $6 million and they agonize over an extra $100 a night for a hotel. That also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">happens. Once they know that they want to go to Italy and see the sunset, it's actually much easier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for them to themselves make decisions about what to cut back on. And that's one of the cruxes of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how to get people to change their behavior with money. What happens if my money dial,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm fortunate because I know my wife would say something similar about food, but let's say she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't care about food and her money dial is clothing. What happens then? We talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">building a vision and your money dials, but what if they don't align?

That's actually a big relief that you and your partner do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have to see eye to eye on everything. But it does help to see eye to eye on a few big things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me give you a few examples, including from my own life. So I love really nice hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife likes them, but she doesn't love them like me. Okay. I love them. And so we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have, we've discussed this a lot and we've come up with a solution that works well for us, which is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, when we travel, sometimes we are going to, we go, it's a special occasion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's an anniversary, et cetera. So jointly, we're going to stay at this beautiful place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes we're going somewhere and she's like, you know what? I'm perfectly happy with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the ordinary place. And I go, Oh, but that city has this awesome resort. I want to stay there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've talked about how do we want to reconcile that? And in our case, we go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I will pay the difference personally, because it's valuable to me. And for her,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">she doesn't really mind it at all staying anywhere. Other times we go somewhere and we're like, Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't actually need to stay at a fancy place. We're perfectly fine. We're going to be in and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">out. Cool. We'll stay at a more modest place. That's fine. But the key is we're talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And we're acknowledging that we've got differences in certain areas and coming up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with a solution for it. More often than not, couples are not, they don't even know what their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">money dial is. They don't know what they love and what they don't love. And so everything becomes an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">existential question.

I don't want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's $1,200 more. And it's purely transactional. And if you have to go through life fighting about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">transaction after transaction, you've made a wrong turn way back there by not identifying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the key things that are important to each of you. You mentioned that you could just use your money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for the nice hotel. Do you think it's helpful for couples to have some money that's their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and some money that's theirs together? What's your perspective there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">100%. So the simplest way to set up joint accounts is one joint account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is used for all joint expenses, rent or mortgage, utilities, cell phone, all that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It pays off your credit card. It goes into joint savings, all of that. But I also recommend having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit of individual money that each of you can do whatever you want with. And I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really healthy. And a lot of people, they prefer to have a little bit squirreled away in their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">personal savings. Fine. Other people want to spend it on their hobby. Fine. In my case, it would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really nice hotels. Also fine. It's no questions asked money. You get to do whatever you want with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it. That is, in my opinion, a really healthy way to approach a hybrid system of joint and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">individual money. And is there a target for how much you put of your earnings into that amount?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And does what you make matter at all in this scenario?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it does. Proportional is always a good way to think about how to set up your account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if one person is making three times what the other person's making, it's fair to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that one approach, which I think is pretty healthy, is for them to pay more for joint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, how you negotiate, how much goes into your individual accounts is up to you. But if a person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is making three X more, it's likely they take a little bit more in their individual accounts as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">well. Also keep in mind that the person who's earning less should not be totally burdened and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be spending 90% of their money on rent because the higher earner wants to live in a nicer place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not fair either. So the model we use is we have one shared checking account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">All the income from everything goes in there.

We have our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">own credit cards and we kind of spend on them how we will. But we're not really keeping track of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who's spending what and it works. Is that okay? Are there problems we're overseeing or we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">missing of giving people a little more freedom because it's all commingled?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a great question. And you are one of the few people who says, "Hey, it's working for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but what problems are we not seeing down the road?"

What we want to do with money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and account setups is to make sure, as you pointed out, that we're not setting ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">up for a big blow up down the road. So here's some things to think about. I know you had kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Before, you may have said like, "Hey, we know how to spend. We're married. We don't have kids."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you have kids, obviously things change a lot. One person might say, "I want to buy a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">really expensive stroller or this type of food, et cetera." And the other might not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do two things. One is you can change the way your accounts are set up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, you can just have open regular conversations. I call them rich life reviews. You do them once a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">month or in certain times, once every two weeks, and you just realign. And you don't have to agree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on everything, again, but you can find solutions to make it work. I do think that some things to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">keep in mind going forward would be big changes in income.

You might go, "Hey, I want to step it up. I want to stay at this place, or I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">fly this type of thing," or whatever. And your wife might not. That's worth a discussion. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">aside from that, if it's working and you have regular conversations, I say thumbs up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's funny.

Two is, I like people to save for something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that they can do that's really fun this year. It could be an overnight trip camping. It could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">an amazing trip to Thailand. It could be a meal at a restaurant that you've both wanted to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's a really fun way to make the connection that spending money can be something that is part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of your rich life. Totally different than, "Oh God, we got to pay this bill." So I hope everybody's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2096" target="_blank">00:34:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hearing over and over, start with the positive.

Start with using your money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to live the rich life and all the restriction and cutting back and all that stuff. We could deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with that stuff later. But I do want to talk about it because I'm imagining a conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">between a couple being, "Okay, what do we want to do? You know what? It'd be really nice to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">go on a trip to Italy, let's say. Everyone wants to go to Italy. And it'd be great if we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bring our family there and with us and we could experience it with them. But it'd also be nice if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we could be there for a few days on our own before. Maybe we even have someone who could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">take care of the kids so we can really enjoy it." It's like, "But when it comes down to it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we still have to pay for that trip. And we don't have the money to pay for that trip right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you get back to reality when you've designed a rich life that you want,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but you just practically can't afford it right now?" Okay. I love your example. First of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">no one ever gets that specific in their example or that big. So like, "Yeah, Chris, you're living</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the life and you're well-experienced with this." But honestly, the way people react,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they shrink their dreams. We've been taught to shrink. So I'll literally ask them, "What's your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">rich life?" And they'll go, "I always have dreamed of having a beach house. It's not like I need a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">big one. It can be a small one. It could be a shack. It could be half flooded, but it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just be kind of nice." I go, "What the hell? Why are you shrinking your dreams in this hypothetical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">example? The point is a rich life, not a small life." So what you just did naturally is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a great example of what I wish people would do, is that we are motivated by big dreams and by vivid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">examples, not by naturally shrinking our dreams to something that seems modest, but actually will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not motivate us three days from now. So that's number one. Number two, it's natural that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">come up with some things you want to do that you can't afford now. That is a good sign you're on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the right track. A rich life is lived today and tomorrow. So we did this exercise. My wife and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I did it together. It's the 10-year bucket list exercise. Love to share it with everybody right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">now. We sat down and we pulled out two pieces of paper. And you can do this. It's really fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">There's basically very few numbers involved. And you go, "Hey, in the next 10 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what can we do that would make it an amazing, rich life?" And so you each take a few minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and you write it down. Some of them can be just for you. Some of them can be together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we compared notes. So we had some examples of learning a different language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera. And each of us go back and forth. And this is where you get curious. "Oh, wow. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">want to learn Spanish? Would we do it in Mexico City? Would you do it alone? Oh, you want to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">skydiving? That's for you. No, thanks. I'll stay on the ground." And we've identified one of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">things that was big. It was the equivalent of the Italy trip. And for us, it was a 10-year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">wedding anniversary abroad. Well, we want to save money for that. So what we did was we did a back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of the napkin calculation. Let's just pretend it's going to cost $10,000, just for easy math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. We know it's going to be roughly 10 years from now. That means we need to save $1,000 per</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">year. Okay, great. We now put that money automatically into a sub-savings account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know for a fact exactly when we will have enough for that dream trip of ours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2293" target="_blank">00:38:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how you do it. I mean, that assumes you had the $1,000 a year to set aside, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you talk about cutting costs mercilessly. Is the other aspect of this trying to go in and see where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2304" target="_blank">00:38:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you're maybe not getting that much value? This is a conversation my wife and I had the other day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We were walking in the neighborhood, and we were like, "Well, if we had $5,000 extra a year to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">spend on something, what would we be excited to spend it on?" Great question. And then we said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"If we look at the marginal $5,000, if we look at what we had to cut out of our budget,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are we getting as much joy out of the first $5,000 to go as we would from the next $5,000 to spend?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And if not, then we should absolutely just cut that $5,000 and swap it out."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we threw savings as a third option. It's like, "We have $5,000. We could save it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we could spend it, or we could spend it more optimally." And did this get you anywhere?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2347" target="_blank">00:39:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">No. What a surprise. I mean, it's a good conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm shocked. I'm so shocked. The minute you said the word "marginal," I was like, "God damn it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is going nowhere." So two people who are too smart for their own good,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a great example where I love that you brought it up and talked about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but I actually, for most people listening, they're not going to use the word "marginal,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and $5,000 would actually be very meaningful. So I totally agree with you that there are places</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2375" target="_blank">00:39:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we can look in our own spending and optimize it, 100%. That comes after identifying what you love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I use the CEO strategy. You can cut costs, you can earn more, you can optimize your existing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">spending. Optimizing would be setting up a reminder once a year, check your insurance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">negotiate your cable, check all the benefits on your credit cards and evaluate whether you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">really need them, evaluate your subscriptions, and many other tools that are available that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">can help people do that. That right there can often save you well over $1,000 a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">well over it. Now, here's the key. Everybody forgets. If you save $1,000 or $2,000 a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure you redirect that money to the places you want, otherwise it will simply get sucked up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">by day-to-day life. And that's a lesson that I learned from someone who's very wise. He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a little older than me. He told me, "Rameeth, when you have kids, if you don't prioritize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">your relationship with your partner, your kids will suck up every minute of your time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's great to spend time with them. Of course you love them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but you've got to set pillars in the ground for you and your partner. And that's the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with money. If you don't prioritize where your money flows, and it's not flowing to something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that's part of your rich life, it will simply get sucked up by random expenses and you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have no idea where it went." So you brought up budgeting a lot. Is that at least a practical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2460" target="_blank">00:41:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">way to get a sense of where you're spending if someone doesn't have a good sense of it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to budget for the last 30 days of your spending, fine.

The approach I try to take is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"What would make this trip magical?" On a recent trip, we went to Japan.

I like that. Actually, what it really reminds me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of is creating rules for the important things in your life. So I have my own 10 money rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife and I are starting to create our joint rules. And so for example, when we travel somewhere,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we talk about where we're going to stay. We talk about how long. So we have one rule,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a minimum of four days because leisure is the ultimate luxury to be able to slow down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and not have to rush around. We recently got a photographer when we were in Japan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to take some photos of us, and we just loved it. We're like, "Wow, we're always going to remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this trip because of these awesome photos." And so we go, "Cool. Let's make that a rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time we travel somewhere, we're going to get a photographer so we can remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3088" target="_blank">00:51:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that experience." Again, these can be really inexpensive things. One person I know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the day they land, they go out to eat.

And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3348" target="_blank">00:55:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">okay if your number is different than somebody else.

It's absolutely fantastic. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or your partner is a high net worth person, or one of you is cheap in the relationship,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JdAFzIF60&t=3395" target="_blank">00:56:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or sometimes both of you are cheap, listen to that one.
