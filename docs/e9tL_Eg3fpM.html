started Answer.AI to help as many people as possible take advantage of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we did that by creating courses to teach people how to use AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which at that time basically meant training your own models.</span></div><div

much easier to use AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and cheaper, and faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Out of that came stuff like ULM

the modern language model movement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and we built software to make it much easier to use AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the foundation, and that worked really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like most of the top practitioners I talked to today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">tell me that Fast.AI has been part of their journey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But I guess what's really exciting is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we're now at a different stage where you don't have to train your own models anymore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and AI can do a whole lot more stuff than it could when we started Fast.AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why Eric Ries and I started Answer.AI to basically go to the next level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, to say, well, we can be more bold now, we can do more with this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">we can get funding to build a team to go even further than Fast.AI could.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think, compared to Fast.AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">what do you think is going to happen with the audience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">or the target persona that you're able to reach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of being able to use AI now versus the way it was before?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So now, you don't need to train a model, and in fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">just like there was a point at which you could suddenly start using the internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">without knowing anything about TCP/IP and SMTP and whatever, you just like, you know, kind of...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That was possible a long time before the iPhone, but in some ways the iPhone was the thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">brought that to most people's fingertips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think ChatGPT was the thing that did the same for AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It meant that now lots of people can use AI without knowing how to code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">without knowing how to train a model, without having lots of computers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that meant that suddenly we've gone from the original Fast.AI target market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">which was anybody who's already pretty good at coding will teach you how to use AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and now our goal is to say, you know, we actually want to basically teach everybody to use AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Having said that, there's still a lot of benefit in knowing how to code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of people now are using AI that really don't know how to code at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've decided... So two things. Fast.AI has become, is now part of AnswerAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And Fast.AI has access to all that additional resources, funding, people working on the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And through that, we can now... And they have now built a new kind of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just a new course. It's a new kind of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">This kind of course has never existed before. It's like a course that is only possible with AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to teach people to solve problems that they previously didn't know how to solve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">using code and AI together. So it's called "How to Solve it with Code". That's the name of the course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">When I said it's a new kind of course, it's not just going to be me on YouTube anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We've literally created a whole new tool with language models built into it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">which people will be able to use to work through the material in "How to Solve it with Code".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've built a whole new platform for this new kind of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Tell me a little bit about this kind of new kind of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">From a more, like, okay, let's zoom out from the tools. Let's talk about, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the new way that you can teach something, or the education, the way it's delivered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, how is this actually different?

And in fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the content didn't change much either, because it was very, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">it was not ephemeral kind of stuff.

But I haven't done another course since 2022. And the reason why is I felt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't make sense to create the same kind of course when the technology has now shifted and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of people that can use the technology is now shifted.

So I didn't feel comfortable creating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">yet another course that was basically the same, because things aren't the same now.

So this is like the first beta version of this new kind of course. I think things are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to go a long way from here. But the basic idea is, like, let's make AI part of the learning process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Not a little add-on chat box in the corner or something, right? But a whole program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">built in and around AI as part of what is taught and how it's taught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about that a little bit more. A lot of people, when they think of AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">they think of it as something they can use to do things for them. I think a lot of people don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">consider them in ways they can use for learning. Can you talk a little bit more about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">what that means in terms of learning with AI? Yeah, okay. I think the question that I start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">with is, well, why are we teaching a course how to solve it with code, when we're saying, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">people don't need code as much anymore? Why is that the first course that we're teaching in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">new way? And you don't really need a course to say, like, how do you use ChatGPT? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get help with prompt engineering and stuff like that.

It's about how to solve problems. And actually, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you're creating an app or a dashboard or whatever, that consists of solving lots of problems.

And we're one of the very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">few groups that are entirely focused on building stuff that combines humans and AI together in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">best possible way. So, that's why, you know, we've created this very new kind of course and very new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of tool to power the course. >> And tell me a little bit more about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the tool and the gap that it fills. Specifically, you know, like, you have all of these tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">like Cursor, Cloud, and they write code for you.

And so, you end up with something that's generally a lot less lines of code than you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">have had if AI had spat out this big thing for you. Why is that? Because, to be honest, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">these language models have not been trained to create -- they can't yet create particularly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">high-quality code, particularly concise code.

And so, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">just ends up being overly complicated and not really customized for your particular problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're solving.

Well, here's a good example, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Our dialogues contain messages.

And, you know, I realized it would be nice to not, like in a chatbot, not always add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">messages to the bottom, like normally happens with chatGPT. But sometimes I'd actually like to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I wish I'd asked a question earlier, you know, and then that becomes kind of part of the dialogue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I wanted the ability to insert a message between two messages. And I, it's like, how do I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">do that? Because my messages have like a primary key, which is an integer, you know, and like you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">can't insert something between two integers.

Gee, that would be weird, you know. But then I could insert it between two messages by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">taking the average of the two float keys. And so, I started this conversation, you know, where I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">like, hey, here's some code I've got. You can see the issue with the primary key. I can't insert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">messages between them. I was thinking of making it a float instead. Is that, like, possible? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the AI is like, oh, yeah, that's not actually unheard of at all, you know. You could use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">something like this. And I was like, okay, well, is this a known technique, you know? Does it have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a name? And it's like, oh, it does actually. It's called fractional indexing. I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I've never heard of it. And I looked it up. And so, then I came back and I was like, oh, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">here's some lines of code to implement this fractional indexing idea.

Because it's got to be like, hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tL_Eg3fpM&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">can you make a float a primary key and use the average of keys to add things?
