This is actually the question from the same guy, James here. He asked both these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">questions.

I got life insurance following the birth of my first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">child.

It's just kind of -- they were kind of like, "Do you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a half a million dollars or a million?"

Just because you make more as a spouse does not mean that you shouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">have insurance on a nonworking spouse or a spouse that makes less than you.

And so that's something to consider as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">well.

So they're saying if we just waited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">or if we took it early, we wouldn't have to pull that forty two hundred from our portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, they've kind of it sounds like they've done the break evens here. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">in my thinking, isn't this just a wash? And then there's other ancillary things you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to think about, like the portfolio withdrawals or minimum distributions or taxes, all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">other stuff. Isn't that kind of what you're getting down to? You're whittling things down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, what I would think about here is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I ran some just some basic some basic numbers here. And I think if you and I'm sure this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't the case, but if the Social Security payments were exactly equal for for each spouse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">here, the break even on this, if you delay, i.e. what what amount of money at what age</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">would the delaying the payout make sense as far as you've now collected the same amount</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of dollars? It's it's just to age 80. So from 70 to 80, you know, you're you're you're catching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">up and you're catching up quickly on those previous eight years. And if you live to 90,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the number ends up being something in the neighborhood of an extra six hundred thousand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars in benefits. So obviously, the longer you live, the better that trade is. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a variable we obviously can't control. Rick Edelman last week, as you mentioned, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty shook after that episode for a lot of reasons. But I think if if you're if you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">got, you know, a decent idea that you're probably going to live into the 90s, then I think delaying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">probably does make sense on paper. The other thing that, you know, we obviously can't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">opine on because we don't know the makeup of the investment accounts here. But if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about RMDs and doing Roth conversions, those kinds of things are going to drag your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">income forward, your ordinary taxable income forward. So if you are doing if you're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">your Social Security at 62, you're doing Roth conversions at 62 through 70. If you're taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">one hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year in whether it be long term cap gains</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">or money from your money from your IRAs, all of a sudden your taxable income is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">be relatively high.

So, you know, there's this is one of those things where, like we tell people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all the time, you can't Google expertise.

Right. And then one question leads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to another question and another one.

So, you know, you know, I'm not sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">here as a as a shill saying, give us a call.

No, they're not. So it's really a question of what are you trying to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">accomplish with the money?

Are you trying to leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">a legacy for kids and grandkids?

Right. So there's a lot of different variables here. But I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I think delaying it could be helpful because you just know that on the back end, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have a guaranteed income. That's also shows what a great deal Social Security</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is for some people. Seventy three hundred dollars a month is I mean, we're talking close</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to ninety thousand dollars a year in income.

And again, like just going back to the tax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">piece of it, like that is the devil's in the details with this stuff. And if you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">really thinking about taxes, you're not thinking about, oh, well, if I do these Roth conversions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=2025" target="_blank">00:33:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and my ordinary income rate gets bumped up and now I'm paying a higher Medicare subsidy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11CdSQcSzP0&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
