Of course, being Pinecone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">their whole thing is vector databases retrieval, so they're pretty good at that sort of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now with Assistant being made generally available, that comes with a few new features. So those are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's a great summary of everything in this article here as well, but those are probably the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">most exciting, in my opinion, the custom instructions, which obviously is pretty useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're building your own agents, and this, which is very cool, so new input and output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">formats. So the input formats, I mean, that's nice, so we have markdown and duct files now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is cool, in addition to PDF and text, but then what I do like here is the output format.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There is essentially a JSON mode, so your agent can output structured output now, and generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking, I'm always a big fan of that because basically everything that I've had to build with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">agents, especially, well, I'd say more recently, but for quite a long time now, that ability to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">output structured text is just incredibly useful, at least to do that reliably. So that's pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">big, in my opinion. Region control, so EU, US, so obviously GDPR if you need that, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I shouldn't say finally, because these are also pretty important, but there are also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's also a new chat API and a new context API, so we'll take a look at all of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, before we jump in, I will just say, so this visualizes things pretty well to why you might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actually want to use PyCon assistance over like OpenAI assistance, which would be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">most similar thing out there. Generally speaking, and we will see this in the example that we walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">through, PyCon assistance is, it's just very good at grounding everything it tells you with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sources. So it's much more trustworthy, much less likely to hallucinate and make stuff up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">than you would find in OpenAI assistance, and you can see some metrics here, but yeah, we'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actually in the example that we walk through, this is the case as well. So the example we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">going to walk through, there will be a link to this example in the description video and also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the top comment video, I will make sure that is in there, but we're going to go in and we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to build something very simple. So we're going to build a assistant, it's going to help us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">understand some, like an AI paper, and it's going to be, it's going to be from Yorkshire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so it will be, well, we'll see, we'll see what it will be like. So first thing is, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">API key, this will be free. So you can go and get an API key, it's app.pycon.io. I did include a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">link here, there. So you can go there, you get your API key, and then you just enter it. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be creating my new assistant called the Yorkshire Assistant. Right now, I don't have any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">assistants, okay, so you can just list those like that. So I'm going to go ahead and create him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So my instructions, of course, one of the key features here is those custom instructions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to go with the typical, you are a helpful assistant that must help with some queries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we're going to modify it a little bit. So he's going to be helpful, and he's also going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to be from the Yorkshire countryside and will always respond with heavy Yorkshire slang,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">colloquialisms, and references to that great county. They will, or he will try, he, she,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">will try to use relevant metaphors to explain, explain concepts to the user. And then one thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that I really like about more recent models is that they do tend to go with markdown output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I found that with assistant, it didn't go with markdown output, which is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">probably not a bad thing. By default, I would maybe rather defined, I would like that. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">just telling it's here. So, you know, format your answers in markdown whilst maintaining the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yorkshire accent. So we create our assistant. Here I'm doing another quick check, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just making sure we don't actually have that assistant already. Then we do create assistant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">passing our name, instructions, and then timeout here is just, okay, how long are we going to wait</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">before we just return? You can, it doesn't really matter, but it's there. Now we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">download a kind of interesting paper. I haven't been through the whole thing, to be honest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but it looks pretty interesting from the abstract. So there is this reasoning language models or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">large reasoning models, a blueprint. So it's just kind of talking about these new models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which are getting a bit of, you know, people like them. It's basically, people are very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in these. It's like the O1s, O3s, and a few of those other ones. So there are quite a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">few of these out there and a lot of people are very interested in them and they are pretty cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have this paper and I want to learn a little bit about it. So we go on, we download it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just going to download it. If you're in Colab, it's going to download it here for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are, of course, local or somewhere else, it's going to just, it's just going to put it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the same file folder that you are working in right now. Okay. We're going to go ahead and I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to take my file name, which is this, I saved it right here, and I'm going to upload that file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I had this metadata, you actually don't even need this and I don't even use it, but you basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just put in some stuff in here. Actually the type of this is a paper. Okay. So, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you can put that in there if you like, you don't have to, it doesn't really matter. But what this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">will do, this is now going to go ahead and it's just going to upload our file. It does take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">moment because it is, well, it's waiting not just for the upload, but also for the file to finish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">processing and also being made available. So you can modify that as a, I think it's a weight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">parameter, if I'm not wrong. And that will basically just say, okay, wait a little bit or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">not. It might also be timeouts, but anyway, you can use that if you want. We're just going to wait.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So that is now uploaded and we're going to go through and just try out these various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">APIs that are available. So very quickly just summarize what those are. There's three, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just three. So there's a chat API. This is like the standard API, which we use to interact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with our system. Think of this like chat completions from OpenAI, but it is Pinecone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">version of that, which obviously has the, you know, the other fields and stuff that are relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to what you're doing here. Okay. So this is the one that you're probably going to want to use if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're using this entire system as essentially a chatbot or like a full-on agent. This is what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">would use. Okay. And we'll, we'll use it in a moment. The other one is the context API. So that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is okay. In some cases, maybe you don't want to use the agent part of what Pinecone is doing here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or what the assistant is. Instead, maybe you just want to, you know, take advantage of Pinecone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieval component, right? So the retrieval of Pinecone is obviously pretty good. So this will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the context API just allows you to take the documents that you have uploaded, the files</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that you've uploaded. They obviously get processed, they get stored, indexed, you know, whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they're doing there. And then this context API basically allows you to retrieve everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It doesn't, it doesn't go through the whole generation. There's no agent that's deciding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, I need to search for this. I'm going to retrieve these. I'm now I'm going to generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">an answer. There's none of that. It's just the retrieval component, right? So if you, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">look, it's basically in retrieval augmented generation, right? That I mentioned here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like the retrieval augmentation parts. So then what you get is all of your citations. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">don't call them citations. They're called snippets. And those snippets are, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's basically your context or your chunks of a document that you can then take and send to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">downstream agent, LLM, you know, whatever you're doing. Okay. So it's up to you to define that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">generation part in the case of using the context API, which I like, I like that they're breaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this apart a little bit because I don't always want to use like the full thing. Then finally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">check completions API. This is the chat API, but it's just an opening eye compatible one. So we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about this later. Yeah, I'll leave it for later, but that can be useful in some scenarios</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. Cool. So let's see how the chat API works first. So chat API, we're going to go in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to create our message lists of messages, which is just role and content,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty familiar format there. And of course, this is a list. So you can have many messages in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You might, you know, when you're obviously using this as a chat bot, you're going to be adding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple messages. It's going to be a conversation. So you would be appending those to your messages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">object as you go or messages list, I should say. So we create our messages. Then we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">go assistant chat. Okay. That's it. It's just assistant chat, super easy. And we just pass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">our messages into the messages parameter there. And then we get a response. Okay. The direct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">content generated by our system is going to be going into a response message content. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going to ask what is a reasoning language model or RLM. And we'll see what happens. I'm not using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">print here, because I've asked it to output things in markdown. So I am just asking one formatting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that into markdown. And you can see here, there isn't actually any markdown necessarily being used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But occasionally there will be some. So it depends on, you know, what is it answering?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't always need to. So we say a up. And RLM or reasoning language model is a type of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">model that sends, you know, so on and so on with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Okay. They're built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on these three main pillars, so on and so on. Right. So it's just explaining what an RLM is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have the traditional sort of Yorkshire AOP there as well. We can run that again, see what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we get. Okay. It's being a little more Yorkshire here. So AOP and RLM or reasoning language model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is a rate fancy type of AI model, which is great. Rate. This sort of stuff, I don't even know how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you can pronounce. Large language models with advanced reasoning mechanisms, complex problems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">solving tasks, integrating structured reasoning processes like Monte Carlo tree search. Okay. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we have that. In essence, RLMs are the next step in AI evolution, combing the best language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding, and advanced reasoning to solve complex problems more effectively. So it's all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right. I mean, I would like more Yorkshire in there, but it was not bad. And it was definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">accurate. So cool. Chat response. We have this. So I just want to show you like the full response,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what we have in there. So what we just extracted out here is this. Okay. So we have this bit here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but you see, there's a ton of other stuff in here as well. And this is useful. This is incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">useful when we're, you know, the whole point of grounding our LLM or agent responses, assistant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">responses, whatever you want to call it, the whole point of grounding them with citations and truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is for the most part to provide users with a little more trust in the system. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's a whole thing of, you know, it wouldn't be able to answer the question if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't give it this information. That's a big part of it, of course. But part of the, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">returning citations is that trust component, which can be very useful. But of course, reading this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't necessarily know where this information is coming from as a user. So one thing that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">think a lot of us would like to do downstream is modify this to actually include the citations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or at least include the sources somewhere in our responses or in our, you know, interfaces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever we're doing. So let's go through this and just see how we'd actually do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So Pinecone does return these citations, okay, which is great. So we have citations. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">citation, it shows the position in the text. This is a character position where that citation is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">coming from, okay. And then it mentions the references. And references is actually a list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So we have a list of these reference objects. Most importantly, we have the pages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right. We have the file that that comes from, which is useful. But I actually think more useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually that we get the signed URL, right. So the signed URL is just like a private URL that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we can access to go ahead and actually see our PDF, right. And this is a PDF using language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is being stored by Pinecone. And then they've given us this link to go and access it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, we can then go and share that link. So in our interfaces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd be taking that signed URL, pushing it forward into like a UI or whatever else. And, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">getting, we're basically able to provide users with, okay, this is exactly where this information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is coming from, which is pretty cool. So we have that. I'm not going to go through this right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Close this. But we have those two bits of information, which are pretty important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in my opinion, and we can do a lot with them. And, yeah, you can see here within the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">references list, I think we have another reference. Yes. So references is actually a list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of references. And we can implement those as we wish. But in this example, we're just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">implement the first reference for each citation that we get here. We have another citation here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">position, you know, a little bit later in the text. That's coming from page three, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so on and so on. You can see it continues going. So we have a few citations in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's see how we might want to integrate that nicely with our response. So within,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as I mentioned, citation object, we have that character position. We have our references,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which includes pages and assigned URL. We're going to use all of that. So what I'm doing here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm creating a citation in markdown. So in markdown, I want to take that pages text or,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, list of pages. And I want to take where that goes to. And let's see what that looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So it looks like this. Pretty messy. But you can see that this is actually just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">markdown format. So we have square brackets followed by link within the standard brackets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we display that in markdown, it's going to look like this. Okay. So we have this nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">little citation. We can click on this. And it'll take us back through to that PDF, which is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can actually go ahead and insert those into our response. So let's go ahead and do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're doing, I'm just taking out the response content. I'm converting it into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">string. So I'm not like overwriting the original. Then I'm going to loop through the citations that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we have in reverse order. So we're going to be inserting them. You know, if we insert them in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the original order, basically we would have to modify the position count for every new insertion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't want to do that because that's complicated. So we'll just do it in the reverse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">order. Okay. So reverse order, we build that citation, which is what I just showed you here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to build this. That's what we do here. Then I'm going to just insert it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have our content. We're going to take the content up to that position, insert our citation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and then content, you know, following that position. This will insert it right after a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">word. So we could also add a little bit of like a space here as well, if we wanted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and that should look a little nicer. It's up to what we would like. Okay. We can see this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So now this is our text, and we have those citations right in the middle of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Which is pretty cool. Great. So we have that. Now, the one thing I did mention before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is that using Pinecone Assistant, you generally get better grounding of knowledge than you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with like OpenAI Assistant. So let's ask a, you know, a kind of relevant question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but this information is just not contained within the paper. Okay. So how many organizations are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">adopting RLMs? That is just not mentioned. So let's see what it comes up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this is the sort of question where typically you're probably fairly likely to end up getting a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucination. And yeah, here we avoid that, fortunately, which is, you know, one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">pros of Pinecone Assistant. So we get a lot. I can't give you an exact number of organizations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">adopting RLMs, but I can tell you that these models are garnering a lot of interest in various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sectors. RLMs are being used in various fields like healthcare, so on and so on. Yeah. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot more Yorkshire in here. And I think that all looks pretty good. So we have that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's saying, okay, I can't give you an exact answer, but, you know, this is probably more of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like an opinion more than anything. So that's pretty cool. Now, context API. This is what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned before. So basically what we have with the chat API is like agent, rag, document processing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that's kind of wrapped into one thing. This is breaking up part of that pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So context API, you're still doing the document processing, right? So that's all handled when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you obviously upload your files, but then retrieval, right? It's extracting out that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the retrieval component or the retrieval augmentation of rag and, you know, getting rid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of the sort of chat or LLM agent component. So let's see, let's have a look at what this looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like. So we're going to say, what is an RLM? Okay. Just see what we get. Okay, cool. So that gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you a lot. So let's try and like pass through this a little bit. So we get this context response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">object inside the context response. We have snippets. That is a list of snippet objects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which contain mainly this content. That's probably what we're most interested in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, you have all this content and these are basically like chunks of document that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant to whatever you've asked, right? So what is it? RLM is probably quite a few relevant chunks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in there. It includes also includes the file with the link as well as before. So you can pull that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">information through if you like, which is useful. And also pretty useful here is the basically the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">pages or the page number where this information is coming from. So, you know, if we're wanting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a little more, a little more control over what we're building, this is pretty good. It means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can use a part of, you know, Pinecone's assistant without using the full thing, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">nice. So yeah, we would take those snippets, feed them into some downstream LM agent, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever it is that you're doing now onto the final API, chat completions API. Now this isn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no new functionality with this API beyond what we have in the chat API. However, what it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">does do is essentially copies, or it does, it copies the OpenAI standard format for chat completions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and allows us to essentially swap out a OpenAI or other LLM that uses the same format as OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It allows us to swap out that API endpoint for Pinecone's assistant, which is pretty useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's, let's see how that works. We go here. We need to get our assistant host,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">assistant name, right? So we're basically constructing a URL here. We have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because we're going to be essentially replacing where OpenAI is pointing to this. Okay. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have our, this is our host. And then we also have in here, this would be Yorkshire assistant. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we put those together to get our base or just URL. Okay. Which is this. And then what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do is actually initialize OpenAI client for API key. We're actually passing in our Pinecone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">API key, but for base URL, we're swapping the standard base or default URL that OpenAI would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">use, which would point to OpenAI with this. Okay. So we run that. And now we can actually interact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with Pinecone assistant as we would with, you know, chat completions through OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can run this. This is exactly the same format that we would use with OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can see here that we are replying to the question before where we're asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about organizations using the new RLMs and we get our rate. Let's have a gander at what we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">here from the search results. It ain't exactly clear how many organizations are adopting RLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So there we go. We we've got our answer. Like it doesn't know again. Right. Which is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is what we want it to be saying. We don't want it to be saying like making things up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That's kind of, you know, just exactly what we don't want it to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is good. And okay. Why would we do that? You know, why, why would we use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">chat completions API? Well, it's basically just to allow us if we're using OpenAI or other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">providers, we can just quickly swap out and sort of test and demo with Pinecone. Or even if we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, if we're offering more, if we've built something and we're offering multiple LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">providers, we can go and just swap that out in our code very easily, which, you know, when you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to move fast, this is incredibly useful. Okay. So with that, we're actually done. So that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's everything with, well, not everything. That's probably the main features of a system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">where we, you know, we should be aware of. Now, finally, when you are done with your system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you might want to delete it so you can go ahead and we'll just run delete your system. Easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I would recommend, so there is this article from Pinecone, so that the sort of blog release</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on this, I think is super helpful in just understanding what is actually going on here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrSJKBfQZM&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which is just incredibly useful.
