Groupmate asks, how do you effectively manage group projects in college? You don't, you know, groupmate, group projects in college are pretty hit or miss, usually pretty bad. You elaborate here that because you're a Cal Newport type, you are organized and therefore you basically end up doing a lot more work because you're not on board with the typical college strategy of, Hey, this is due tomorrow. Why don't we stay up all night and do something kind of crappy. You actually want to plan your workout in advance. And so you end up doing most of the work. That is the price you pay to have your act together in college. You're not going to love group work. The only two pieces of advice I can give is a avoid it when you can, because it's not going to go well for you. B, work with the very best people you can. I mean, I remember having this experience as an undergraduate computer science student with problem set groups, and I was good at computer science. I'll put this the humble way. I was good at computer sciences, as you might've predicted based on my later career trajectory. I learned pretty quickly that there was a lot of people who wanted to be in problem set groups with me because they would get all the right answers. It wasn't very useful to me though. Right. I would basically just do the work. And eventually I found one or two students who were really smart. And these were the students I would come back to, to work with again and again. And we complimented each other and it made these problem set groups really effective. I actually got a note like a year or two ago. It was actually pretty cool. I'd forgotten about it, but it was a group mate I worked with in a lot of courses. I really liked working with, and he came across on my writing or something recently. So this is, you know, 15, 16 years later. And he sent me a note about, Hey, I remember working on problem sets with you back at, back at college. So that was pretty cool. Um, and, but that was really useful. So pick the smartest people, the most organized people you can, when you can avoid group projects when you can't. And when all that else fails, I'm just going to validate your frustration. I'm not a big fan of group projects in college. And so you're not doing anything wrong. It's just kind of the price you pay. Yeah.   (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
