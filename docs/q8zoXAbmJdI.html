It's great to be here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My name is Grant. I am one of the co-founders and the CEO of Gamma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We are basically, as alluded to, building the anti-PowerPoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are trying to reimagine how people create and share content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make that dead simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this all started with kind of just trying to solve my own problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was previously doing consulting and, like many of us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have probably seen a page or a slide that looks like this, the blank slide,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and just had this feeling like there's got to be a better way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've been spending the past four years just really trying to reimagine the building blocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How can we make it dramatically simpler so that we're not spending all this time designing, formatting boxes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">aligning boxes, resizing them, figuring out the right layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can focus on the content itself and let it feel more like a content-first approach versus a design-first approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, we have grown over the years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for us, we're really trying to deliver both speed and power to our users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of what we pride ourselves in is giving people simple tools to really mold and shape their presentations, their content much simpler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And longer term, we're trying to build what we call tools for imagination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the whole notion of how can we help people really sort of stretch, shape their ideas in a way that's way easier for them to share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we can do that, maybe we can help kind of push innovation forward in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this talk isn't about any of that because, you know, most of the talks today, really great talks around really innovation, obviously AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very much a product, you know, centric lens that people are applying, which is amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to take a step back and, you know, I think a lot of founders are great at applying sort of first principles to thinking about how do I build product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would encourage everyone to think about we're in an era where we can also apply those first principles to think about how do we build a team?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we innovate on org design?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're obviously still learning ourselves, but I just want to share, you know, some of those lessons along the way to hopefully inspire you to all think about maybe there's a different way about building teams in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the old way. We're all used to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's many, many different flavors of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once an organization starts getting big, inevitably you have a bunch of hierarchy and that could take shape in itself in many, many ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, what traditionally happens is once a startup starts scaling, you'll bring on the sort of VP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The VP will go on and hire their directors. Directors will go on and hire their direct reports and you get this sort of cascading effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this happens across every single function. And you can go from a small team, a tiny team to a team that ends up becoming much, much bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can happen overnight. I mean, we've all lived probably through the blitz scaling phase of startups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, some of that still exists, but I do think there today can be maybe a new way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for us, you know, we've reached over 50 million users now. We're still a team of 30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, this is only more recently that we've become a team of 30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, again, these are things that we're still learning along the way and trying to think about what are some of the themes that we're starting to see that we can start talking about and sharing and obviously getting input from you all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then for us to continue to learn, learn and adapt. So this kind of impacts three different pillars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first pillar is obvious. Where do you begin? Who do you even hire for us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk a little bit about kind of the rise of the generalist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What does that look like in practice? The second is, OK, now that you have a team, how do you manage that team?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk about this notion of introducing the player coach, something that is very critical to how we build and manage the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last is, how do you scale? You actually have a team, whether it's 10, 30 more, how do you actually prepare for the next phase?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean you don't hire at all. It just means relative to maybe where you were to companies before, you're just much smaller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For us, you know, at our scale, I would say we're probably one tenth the size of what we would have been if we were started just a few years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just a different way of like framing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's first talk about kind of what I call the rise of the generalist and what does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This notion of a generalist is, you know, in engineering, you might have an idea, this notion of like a full stack engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It applies to many different disciplines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This one concrete example I'll provide is, you know, a generalist on our team is our head of design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was also happens to be our first hire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He is a designer that is both, you know, super visual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He actually knows how to code as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in addition to that, he can actually really go deep on the core UX.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he loves researching, talking to users, doing all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that empowers him to really what I call kind of connect all the dots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You might be able to pull in and really empathize with, you know, your engineering counterpart by knowing like, okay, deeply what is, what are we actually capable of building?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that when you go off and vibe, go to prototype, it's actually something you can ship and actually deliver in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so understanding that comes with just being able to actually play with everything and have much deeper empathy for what you're building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He also has this really willingness to sort of adapt and reinvent himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So every phase of growth, he's had to kind of change it up a little bit like early on when, you know, there's really no product itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you're trying to think about, okay, what is the basic, most simple UI UX that we can deliver to a user?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As a, as the product becomes much more complex, you need to iterate really fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's the one coding prototypes, getting in the hands of users, setting up user tests, interviewing them, getting feedback, getting that back into the hands of users, iterating that a ton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're also at a scale now where he's also able to look across the team and actually provide, you know, guidance and mentorship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll get into sort of player coach in a second, because he's actually one of those as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Inherently, I think what makes a strong generalist is someone that both likes to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And likes to teach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think learning, it's one of those things like if you're a continuous learner, especially in this age, it's very valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=376"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you can do is rather than just having the head coach make all the calls, make all the play, call all the plays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in football that could be you have a quarterback on the offensive side on

player coaches on the field that are able to actually understand how can we adapt?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=470"

context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">understands the nuances, can

this really, really lean team where, you know, we still have the ability to mentor and coach the individuals that need it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have deep domain, like technical expertise in places where, you know,

brand and culture?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I say brand and

target="_blank">00:09:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Brand is ultimately a reflection of your culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your culture is your values as a company, and you really want those two to go hand in

is a little bit more obvious, but when you're a small team, what ends up becoming super important is like every new team member you bring on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to believe that they share your same values, that they operate the same way, because you can't afford that not to be the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a living culture deck that we've maintained basically since the beginning, and we rewrite it all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We look up at the makeup of the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We kind

target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we share that back out to the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We onboard new employees with the same culture deck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an ongoing evergreen sort of exercise that we go through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think what comes out of this is like this feeling that this tiny team can have this feeling of being a small tribe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that tribe is something that's pretty magical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It allows you to have this feeling of continuity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It allows you to have this like feeling that you are in it together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you have that continuity, there's just so much like, it's hard to even quantify that value because you're not having to retrain people, re-onboard people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like people just get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's that tribal knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do think there's a lot of magic that happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That translates into just, in my mind, higher productivity, transparency, shared context amongst all things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have in our team, and it's easier to do this when you're small, is we have like three standing all company, all hands meetings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The very beginning of the week, we start with like going deep on metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We talk about, we have this thing called the wall of work where everybody's showing like what everyone else is working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wednesdays and Fridays, we do company-wide show and tell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a chance for people to also dog food our own product, use Gamma, present, share what they're working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be a small project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be a

continuity just allows everyone to feel like we're still in a small room sharing this, you know, big, ambitious, long-term vision and do it together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there's a lot of talk of like, oh, maybe there'll be the one billion, one-person startup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know, maybe that will happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But my thought is like, why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's so fun to build with a team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like why do it alone?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're having a ton of fun building as a small team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of that is like, we really want to, you know, preserve that magic for as long as humanly possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this, you know, talk started with me talking about how the Gamma journey began, which is me thinking about, hey, from a product perspective, you know, there's got to be a better way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And my, you know, I guess challenge to you all is as you think about building your own teams, really thinking about, hey, you know, there's the old playbook, the old way of scaling and building up a team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's totally fine, but is there today a better way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully you guys can find your own path and hopefully share back and we can all, you know, do this together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess we have a few minutes for questions if anybody has any.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With AI moving so fast, if you could go back, what would you do differently about building your current team now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was with AI moving so fast, what would I have done differently?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually started, you know, four years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was before like the more recent, you know, wave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I do think, you know, when you're early on, whether you're using AI or not, you're going to probably spend some time in the idea maze.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're really trying to navigate, figure out where is their true user need and what problems are we solving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do think they're the temptation today is the move super fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I can do everything for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you just jump onto the thing and start building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I still think people can afford to go be much more patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think even for us, like when we initially started doing our first AI launches of two years ago, I almost wish like in hindsight, we could have like really just taken our time to appreciate how much things are changing and evolving before going to like full steam ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, let's just build, build, build because part of that, I think, realization that we did have starting to build is that, hey, because things are moving so fast, like are there infrastructure decisions we should be thinking about earlier, much earlier on before things become too late.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You get to a scale where it's impossible to unwind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's helpful to think a little bit more about that way earlier on in the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Doesn't mean you should slow down, just means you should be thoughtful of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have an example of an infrastructure decision that you would have come back and done differently?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not something I would have done differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I would have prioritized maybe more effort around even more so is we have a lot of infrastructure built around experimentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's obvious now, like given all the different tooling, like, you know, especially have a big user base, experimentation is a key to velocity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we did do some of that pretty early on, but it was more of a sort of gradual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we would have, you know, really taken our time to think about, okay, what should we do and like put more weight behind it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, if it would have changed anything, I'm not sure, but I think that's one thing, you know, I would have kept in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have two, go here and then here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you might already be there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At some point, you probably will have to bring in people, whether they're like communication experts or legal experts, that maybe don't gel quite as much with maybe like the technical or engineering led culture you might have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have any advice for like how to make how to not like ruin some of that culture, but also make sure that they don't feel completely excluded?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the way we've been trying to do it is for the founders or other leaders to try to do the job first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is outside of engineering, basically, how do you, you know, potentially not mess things up by growing too fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, we're still learning there oftentimes a lot of the jobs for me, for instance, a lot of marketing, sales, customer experience was all done by me first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have some sort of baseline understanding because, you know, I was in a previous life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've never hired for those functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do I even know what good looks like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I try to do the job myself, oftentimes not a great job at it, but understand all the nuances that take the really goes into that job, know what great looks like, and then go out and finally hire that person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We going back to the player coach, we still go out and find player coaches for that role, so that it doesn't end up becoming this sort of cascading effect of like really, really big and bloated teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the player coach stuff sounds like you're hiring a lot of high agency people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you judge high agency when you're hiring people? That does not necessarily come from their resumes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What kinds of questions do you ask? What kinds of processes do you follow during hiring to judge for high agency?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, totally. It's probably stuff that you have heard before, but a lot of times, you know, you want to, if someone has prior work experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you dig into their most challenging project or problem they had to encounter, and you ask them, you know, basically how they solved it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What you'll find is people that have high agency or just a sense of ownership in general, they don't immediately jump to what the solution was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll talk about how they try to understand the problem, and then how the problem, what they understood at the surface level is actually five levels too high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to keep on drilling. And if they can articulate what the true problem was, like keep on going down, and then not only talk about what the solution was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but all the attempts at the solution, I think that goes to show that someone wasn't just like taking orders and like, hey, I'm going to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like, I need to fund, one, understand the layers of the problem, and then two, navigate and actually explore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people, when you start asking them like the second order or third order whys, they can't get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they can't, then it's pretty clear that they probably weren't doing much of the thinking themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, thanks for the comments. So hiring is probably one of the most important things that a company can do, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's either for better or worse. What are some, if there were any major failures that you have experienced that you could share with us, that would be very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the biggest failures were actually when we didn't, when there was a role that there was some ambiguity, and we weren't able to do a work trial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So work trial is also something I didn't talk about, something we deploy, where people actually do the job for a certain amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Much easier if they're obviously not currently working, and we've had great success when someone's in between or has been doing fractional work, we bring them to do the job first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we do that for a few months, where we had some roles where we weren't yet sure what we're looking for, and we brought them on, and they didn't do a work trial, they just went straight in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It oftentimes wasn't a good fit, because neither them or us knew kind of like, okay, what were we actually, what was going to be that sort of good fit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you can, if you're lucky enough to be able to do a work trial, whether it's two days or three months, in our case, we default to three months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would encourage you to try to do that, especially if it's a role you haven't done yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you had situations where you didn't work out then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The work trials have actually all worked out, which is great and a few data points. And we've done five plus of them. And then in the cases where we didn't, it's actually pretty high. Again, going back to the role that we weren't certain about what we're hiring for is actually pretty high failure rate for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that it? All right. Thank you, everyone. I'm on LinkedIn if anyone wants to connect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8zoXAbmJdI&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, everyone wants to connect.</span></div></div></body></html>
