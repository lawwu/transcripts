Now, the question is, how do we get there? Once we've got the clarity on the thing, once we've tried to figure out what our emotions are getting in the way, at some point, some stuff is just kind of boring and you just kind of have to do it.</p><p>So how do you nudge yourself to just get started? At this point, some people would say that motivation is a thing. You've got to motivate yourself to do it. You've got to really want it. You've got to want it so much that you can't breathe or whatever these motivational videos say.</p><p>And that's fine. But there's a great book by Jeff Hayden called The Motivation Myth, which basically argues that motivation is a bit of a myth. We don't summon up the motivation magically to do a thing. We do the thing. And by seeing a small success, that then helps us summon the motivation to continue to do the thing.</p><p>And so really, motivation doesn't lead to action. Action leads to motivation.</p></div></div></body></html>
