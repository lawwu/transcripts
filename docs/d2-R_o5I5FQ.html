When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">should I not? So I want to just start by framing this. LangChain is one of, if not the most popular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">open source framework within the Python ecosystem, at least for AI. It works pretty well for a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">things and also works terribly for a lot of things as well, to be completely honest. There are massive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">pros, massive cons to using LangChain. Here, we're just going to discuss a few of those and see how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">LangChain maybe compares a little bit against other frameworks. So the very first question we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">should be asking ourselves is, do we even need a framework? Is a framework actually needed when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we can just hit an API, you have the OpenAI API, other APIs, Mistral, so on, and we can get a response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">from an LLM in five lines of code on average for those. It is incredibly, incredibly simple. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that can change very quickly when we start talking about agents or retrieval augmented generation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">research assistance, all this sort of stuff, those use cases, those methods can suddenly get quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">complicated when we're outside of frameworks. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, right? It can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">incredibly useful to be able to just understand everything that is going on and build it yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But the problem is that to do that, you need time. Like you need to learn all the intricacies of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">building these things, the intricacies of these methods themselves, like what, you know, how do they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">even work? And that kind of runs in the opposite direction of what we see with AI at the moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">which is AI is being integrated into the world at an incredibly fast rate. And because of this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">most engineers coming into the space are not from a machine learning or AI background. Most people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">don't necessarily have any experience with the system. A lot of engineers coming in that could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">DevOps engineers, generic backend Python engineers, even frontend engineers coming in and building all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">these things, which is great, but they don't necessarily have the experience. And that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that might be you as well. And that's not a bad thing because the idea is that obviously you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">learn and you're going to pick up a lot of these things. And in this scenario, there's quite a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">argument for using a framework because a framework means that you can get started faster and a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">framework like LangChain, it abstracts away a lot of stuff. And that's a big complaint that a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">people will have with LangChain, but that abstracting away of many things is also what makes LangChain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">popular because it means that you can come in not really knowing, okay, what, you know, RAG is, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">example, and you can implement a RAG pipeline, get the benefits of it without really needing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">understand it. And yes, there's an argument against that as well, just implementing something without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really understanding it. But as we'll see throughout the course, it is possible to work with LangChain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">in a way, as we will in this course, where you can implement these things in an abstract way and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">break them apart and start understanding the intricacies at least a little bit. So that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">actually be pretty good. However, again, circling back to what we said at the start, if the idea or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">your application is just a very simple, you know, you need to generate some text based on some basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">input, maybe you should just use an API that's completely valid as well. Now, we just said, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people coming to LangChain might not be from an AI background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So another question for a lot of these engineers might be, okay, if I want to learn about, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">RAG, agents, all of these things, should I skip LangChain and just try and build it from scratch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">myself? Well, LangChain can help a lot with that learning journey. So you can start very abstract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you gradually begin to understand the framework better, you can strip away more and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">more of those abstractions and get more into the details. And in my opinion, this gradual shift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">towards more explicit code with less abstraction is a really nice feature. And it's also what we focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">on, right? Throughout this course, that's what we're going to be doing. Going to sign abstract,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">stripping away the abstractions and getting more explicit with what we're building. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">building an agent in LangChain, there's in this very simple and incredibly abstract create tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">agent method that we can use. And like it creates a tool agent for you. It's, it doesn't tell you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">anything. So you can, you can use that, right? And we will use that initially in the course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but then you can actually go from that to defining your full agent execution logic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is basically a tools call to open AI. You're going to be getting that tool information back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but then you've got to figure out, okay, how am I going to execute that? How am I going to store this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">information? And then how am I going to iterate through this? So we're going to be seeing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">stripping away abstractions as we work through, as we build agents, as we do, as we build like our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">streaming use case, among the many other things, even chat memory, we'll see there as well. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">LangChain can act as the on-ramp to your AI learning experience. Then what you might find,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and I do think this is quite true for most people, is that if you, if you're really serious about AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering and that's what you want to do, like that's your focus, right? Which isn't for everyone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for certain. A lot of people just want to understand a bit of AI and they want to continue doing what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they're doing and just integrate AI here and there. And maybe those, you know, if that's your focus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you might stick with LangChain. You know, there's not necessarily a reason to move on. But in the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">scenario where you're thinking, okay, I want to get really good at this. I want to just learn as much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">as I can. And I'm going to dedicate basically my, you know, my short term future of my career</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on becoming AI engineer. Then LangChain might be the on-ramp. It might be your initial learning curve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but then after you've become competent with LangChain, you might actually find that you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to move on to other frameworks. And that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have wasted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">your time with LangChain.

And it still uses a lot of LangChain objects and methods, and of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">concepts as well. So even if you do move on from LangChain, you may move on to something like LangGraph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">which you can't know LangChain for anyway. And let's say you do move on to another framework</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">instead. In that scenario, the concepts that you learn from LangChain are still pretty important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So to just finish up this chapter, I just want to summarize on that question of should you be using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">LangChain? What's important to remember is that LangChain does abstract a lot. Now, this abstraction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">of LangChain is both a strength and a weakness. With more experience, those abstractions can feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like a limitation. And that is why we sort of go with the idea that LangChain is really good to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">started with. But as the project grows in complexity or the engineers get more experience, they might move</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on something like LangGraph, which in any case, is going to be using LangChain to some degree. So in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">either one of those scenarios, LangChain is going to be a core tool in an AI engineered toolkit. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">worth learning in our opinion. But of course, it comes with its, you know, it comes with its weaknesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just good to be aware of that it's not a perfect framework. But for the most part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you will learn a lot from it, and you will be able to build a lot with it. So with all of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll move on to our first sort of hands-on chapter with LangChain, where we'll just introduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-R_o5I5FQ&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">LangChain, some of the essential concepts.
