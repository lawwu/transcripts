href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=3" target="_blank">00:00:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this final segment, I want to mention the books I read in December 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=9" target="_blank">00:00:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you might recall, December for me is Thriller December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is the month in which I like to read adventure or thriller novels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the genre that I really like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of holidays in December, so it's a tradition of mine to read more thrillers than normal in December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I read three thrillers in December, Jesse, and I will go through them all right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, the first one I read, The Apollo Murders by Chris Hadfield.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a action thriller that takes place in an alternative timeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's in the 70s, and it's positing an alternative timeline where we did a few more Apollo programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't want to give too many details away other than there's gun battles happening in space with the Soviets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What was cool about this book, what attracted me to it is that Chris Hadfield, the author, is an astronaut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this actually has realistic, realistic details of how all the 1970s era Apollo space program technology actually worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He actually understands space and what this world is like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I like that idea that it was written by an astronaut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A book about astronaut murders is pretty good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The next one I read was Recursion by Blake Crouch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to flag this book for a second because I read a lot of thrillers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Recursion is about as platonic of an example I have found of perfection in pacing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a master class in thriller structure and pacing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Really, this piece of it is brilliantly done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's datelined chapters, and you're moving back and forth between two timelines, and those timelines kind of catch up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way it moves back and forth, back and forth, and ratchets up is just a precision plot construction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a book that's really hard to put down once you pick it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was really impressed by it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I was so impressed by it that I was a little bit disappointed when I went back to read a prior book of Blake's, which was good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But man, with Recursion, he has the pacing just locked in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the best thriller pacing I've read, one of the best thriller pacings I've probably ever read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When was it written?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This book would have been, I don't know, the last 10 years or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a time, I won't give away everything that happens, but the way it opens is it's playing with time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's a techno-thriller writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's like our age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not like, I used to say relatively young.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess we're not that young anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's this virus sort of happening where people are having memories of different lives suddenly appear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it seems to be contagious, like people nearby have the same thing happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a detective that's trying to unwind what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it starts to unravel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you get a plot line from back in time and it catches up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it gets crazy at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyways, perfection in structure and pacing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The last thriller I read in December was The Last Juror by John Grisham.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just had it from a little free library here in Tacoma Park.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the thing about being a writer like John Grisham.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have that one or two huge successes early on, you can just keep writing books that don't have to be blockbusters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if The Last Juror was written by someone else, you know, like us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But because he wrote The Firm, because he wrote The Pelican Brief and The Client, and he became such a superstar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you could just write these books where they don't have to be bangers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just, it's a guy starting up a newspaper in the small Mississippi town that he likes to write about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a trial and 20 years later, like some of the jurors start dying out, like being killed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they kind of figure out what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I enjoyed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I enjoyed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if, if, if this was the book you ran instead of The Firm, you wouldn't know the name John Grisham.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a good gig if you can get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's another thriller I didn't quite finish in December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">So I really read four in December, but the fifth one I didn't finish until into January.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll get it with the next list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I read two other books as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Non-thrillers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One was called Living with Frankenstein by Stephen Schoen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is I'm working on some things with artificial intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is like a small philosophical tract about machine sentience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like a gentleman scholar has this thesis about, you know, what does it really mean for technology to be conscious?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he has a much lower bar for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And things were already there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I needed it for something I was doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What I enjoyed more was John Meacham's And There Was Light.</span></div><div

biography.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Very good.</span></div><div

the lens of in part ethics and in part religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the virtue ethics worldview of Lincoln and then also the impact of religions on Lincoln.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the early part of Lincoln's life, I really enjoyed the way this Meacham treated it because what he does good in this book, and I've read a lot of Lincoln books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What he does good in this book is set context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of primary sources that he pulls from to set the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's one of the better, for example, depictions of Southern culture and, uh, during the pre-war period, because he, he pulls from sermons and newspapers and headlines to try to really understand the reactionary culture that was emerging in the South in defense of slavery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And like understanding that really helps make sense of some of the big historical things that happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He goes to primary sources to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, another thing I learned from Meacham, which was really interesting was I didn't know this, and I read a lot of Lincoln that, you know, Lincoln's family, when he was a young kid was attending a church at one of these rural churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was, um, it's very antislavery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was, he was exposed to antislavery thinking in part because of this was the early exposure he had to it was in church, which I hadn't heard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I had heard about the, there's a labor argument, you know, his dad, um, was a working poor working class white and Illinois were worried about the economic ramifications of slave labor coming into their state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had heard that piece of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he grew up in an antislavery household, but he was inculcated with a religious antislavery message and Meacham went back and like found, here's the preacher and here's the type of things they talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought that was all good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once they get to the war and the presidency, it's like real fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He just covers it and you know, 70 pages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just, it moves by really fast, but enjoyed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, Jesse, those are my five books from December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Next month we will talk about the five books I read in January.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CorpTFhQ2go&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span
