So in other words, this is an experiment. It could fail. Okay, like any good experiment. Exactly. All different, yes? You want to mix them? Sure. Shuffle them as much as you want. This is just one way to do it.</p><p>No, I'm not good at shuffling. Whatever you want. I'll just do this sort of like a kindergarten shuffle. There's probably a kindergartner out there that can really shuffle cards. As you're doing this, I want you to think of a card. Please, but don't say it. Just think of it.</p><p>Okay. So right now, as you're doing this, the location where that card is changes. Because every time you cut, complete, shuffle, it's in a different location. We don't know where it is. Let's do this. Even if I know exactly where it is, you don't know where it is. Correct.</p><p>Name the card. Jack of hearts. Again, you don't know where it is. I'll do it super slow, and you say the word "stop" whenever it feels right to you. It does not matter to me when. Stop. Okay, I was about to move more. Should I stop? No, you can move it.</p><p>The one card? One last move. That's good? Yep. Let me ask you a question. Do you want the card to be first or second? One or two? Your choice. Second in the stack. So not the first, second? Correct. And the card was? Jack of hearts. So not the first, second?</p><p>Correct. Let's see. That's the first. Eight of diamonds. And you want second? Yeah. To be the jack of hearts. That would be amazing. I'm shocked. I'm shocked, too. I'm shocked, too. Because I "shuffled" the deck. You did shuffle. Yeah. So when you think of a card, let's give them a little mix.</p><p>When you think of a card, okay, don't say it. Say the word "stop" any time you want. Stop. This one or this one or this one or this one or this one. Whichever you want. This one. Even though you stopped on this. Sure. Place your finger right on top.</p><p>Tight, tight. Okay. Let me ask you a question. How crazy would it be if this is the card you're thinking of, merely thinking of? What's the card you're thinking of? Ace of diamonds. It's a common card. If you want, you can change it to a different card or stick to this one.</p><p>Ace of diamonds. Ace of diamonds. It's great. And it could be any. And you also, you had the card the whole time right here with your finger on top of it the whole time. Right. What? It's not the ace of diamonds. It's not? No. Oh, goodness, my friend. It's still not.</p><p>So, here's something I didn't teach. I didn't tell you this. The queen of hearts, she's considered a psychic card. She knew you're going to say the ace of diamonds. So, in her pocket, she took it out and she's holding it. Take a look. She's holding the ace of diamonds.</p><p>I mean, can I expect -- Yes. Is this true of any other card in the world? Yes. A lot of people don't know this, but most queens, they hold flowers. Let me show you. Here, flowers, flowers, and flowers. This is sort of, but not quite. Wow. Let's do something with your phone.</p><p>Open your phone. Open your phone. Let's do something with your phone. Open to your calculator. Zero it out. I don't want to see what you type. I'm going to turn around. Punch in four digits, but make it random. Don't overthink it. Four digits. Do plus. And now I want you to put a four-digit number that's meaningful to you.</p><p>It could be a code. It could be an address. It could be anything, a date, a year, anything you like. And then equal. Okay. So, right now, it's a combination of a number that's meaningful with a number that means absolutely nothing. Correct. Can we see it? Do the equal sign.</p><p>You did it at the end, right? Yeah. Okay. That's the combination of both? Yeah. Perfect. Can I see? Yep. So, that number means nothing to you. It's 12915. I don't know if it's meaningful or not. It's a meaningful number plus a, you know. And you did zero out between.</p><p>I did. Okay. Take these. Give them a bit of a mix, as much as you want. Okay. People can make fun of my shuffling again. No, no, no. I want you to think why the number is important to you, but don't say it. Why that particular number is important?</p><p>Just think, yeah. Okay. Yep. It's not a code, right? It's not quite a code, is it? It is a code. It is a code. But it also means like a date or something like that? Part of it? No. Really? Yeah. It's an important code. It's an important code. It's an important code.</p><p>Hmm. So, let's do this. As I go through these, okay? I want you to pull one or two or three or four cards. In one group. One group. Go ahead. As a group. Yeah. As a group. As a group. Okay. One or two or three or four cards. In one group.</p><p>One group. Go ahead. As a group. Yeah. Four. How many do you have? There we go. It's four, right? Take four? Yeah, sure. Okay. No, no. Put them further. Uh-huh. And these are the cards. Four or five? How many? Let's see. It should be four. Yeah, four. Perfect. And you plucked them from somewhere in here.</p><p>Yeah. Could have been anywhere from here. Right. The number that's important to you, what's the first digit? Seven. And then? Six. Seven. No way. There's only one person on this planet that knows this number. No, everybody does. Unfortunately. Nine. Goodness gracious. That makes no sense. I mean, it makes sense that you would get it right because you're you.</p><p>That's amazing. This combination harkens back to something that I learned when I was like six years old and was passed to me by somebody that would never, ever reveal that. Yeah, amazing. Wow. That's crazy. That's crazy. Open your camera. Okay. Take a very bizarre photo. Okay. If you don't mind.</p><p>Yeah. Of you just holding my wallet. So, usually I have my ID for this show. I took everything out. Sure. That's a nice wallet. Right there and right there. Nothing there, right? Take a look. Nope. Okay. Nothing. Good for you? Yeah. Okay, let's do this. Just look at me.</p><p>There's a bit of a... Well, you got it. Okay. I took one photo. Can you please close that first? Lock it in and then close it again. Let me ask you a question. You know, we already spoke about it. The idea that I can make you choose certain things or act according to what I want you to do, right?</p><p>So, if I ask you to name any playing card, seriously, any playing card, what would you name? Doesn't matter which one. Three of diamonds. Are you sure or do you want to change? Three of diamonds. Okay. So, it could be really any one of these. I'm telling you this.</p><p>I'm going to try to kind of force you. Don't let me. So, you know what's happening. So, just take any one you like, any one that you like, but halfway out, halfway out. Okay, halfway out. Okay, if you think I made you take that, push to take a different one.</p><p>I don't, but for sake of... You're okay. I like that. I like that. Sure, sure. Take a different one then. It's okay to move that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go with this one. So, you said three of diamonds. Correct. If that's the three of diamonds, would that be impressive?</p><p>That would just be wild. Can I ask you an honest question? Yeah. How impressive would it be, considering you've seen me do stuff before? Be honest, between one and ten. It would be a seven, because I want to leave room for no. I'm going for much, much better. What if I do this, and the three of diamonds shoots out and lands right here?</p><p>That would be wild. That's a ten. No. What if it lands under my wallet? That would be spectacular. What about inside the wallet? That would be, what's the technical term, effing spectacular. This has been here the whole time. Can you open it yourself? Can you undo this? No, no, right there.</p><p>Okay. Open. No way. What the? There you go. Goodness gracious. Let's do this again. Can you close it again? Just lock it all the way in, lock it in, and put this in your pocket, or anywhere. We'll do this again. Okay. The only criteria is that you do choose a different card, okay?</p><p>Okay. I'll just do this, and you say the word "stop" whenever it feels right. Stop. Take the card. And just-- Whichever, doesn't matter. Yep. Not the three of diamonds, I hope? Nope. Okay. Push it anywhere in the middle. The wallet is there? The wallet is here. Name the card.</p><p>Three of hearts. In the wallet. No, no, not this wallet. Remember we took a photo of you holding the wallet at the beginning, empty? It traveled to the wallet in the photo. Three of hearts, you said? Take a look at the last photo. Zoom on it. It's the three of hearts.</p><p>Wow. Goodness gracious. Wow, wow, wow. Wait, and if I go to the photo right before it, it's actually a video of Cal Newport, a previous guest. So just to prove that it's not like multiple photos, not that that would explain anything. And then our cameraman, Martin, got a cameo there, too.</p><p>Mind blown. Oh, my goodness. What the-- I don't know. Sorry. That was great. For once, I'm speechless. Good. Amazing. That's amazing. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks for--I don't really know what to say. There's a neural circuit going--and there's another circle--neural circuit, excuse me, that's involved in awe, which is just going--good.</p><p>And you don't want to know how, right? You know, in this case, not only do I not want to know how, it places the brain into a place of there's no way how, but it just happened. It's a good place to be. Yeah, it is a good place to be.</p></div></div></body></html>
