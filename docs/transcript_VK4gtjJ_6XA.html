And I think the only thing I see going wrong in people's lives is I've seen people get fired from their jobs when they don't disclose that they have a side hustle.</p><p>And I think it like eats at your soul a little bit to not live in the light. And so as an owner of a business, I think personally, if people are working in my business and on my business, and really they're like focused on something else, they want to be doing something else.</p><p>And remember, when you own a business in the future, you will be the person with employees that might be distracted. So I always kind of push people to think like you already are an owner and then ask yourself, what would you want your employees to do? That's my only caveat to side hustles these days.</p><p>I think those sites where people have like, you know, the Reddit sites where they have 400 different jobs. And, you know, these people who talk about having 37 side hustles, I actually think it makes you distracted, it makes you less happy, and it often makes you less money.</p></div></div></body></html>
