And now, dear friends, here's Jack Weatherford. Genghis Khan, born in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">1862, became the conqueror of the largest contiguous empire in history. But before that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">he was a boy named Temujin, who at nine years old lost everything. His father, his tribe, living in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">poverty, abandoned to the harshness of the Mongolian steppe. From a boy with nothing to the conqueror</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of the world. So tell me about this boy, his childhood and the Mongolian steppe from which he came from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The story of Genghis Khan, like the story I think of all of us, it doesn't begin at birth. That's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning of life. The story begins long before birth. And sometimes it can be many generations before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and sometimes only shortly before. But I think with Genghis Khan, a crucial thing is to understand how his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">parents met and then how he was conceived. And that is that one day, a cart was coming across the Mongol</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">territory. And only women drove carts. Men rode horses. Women also rode horses. But women owned the houses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">which were called gears, the tents. They owned all the household equipment. And so they had to have carts for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">moving back and forth. And the fact that a cart was moving meant that some woman was moving from one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">place to another. And in fact, her husband was with her. She was a new bride. And her husband was on a horse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happened was a man named Yasuke. Yasuke, the future father of Genghis Khan. Yasuke was up on a hill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">He was hunting with his falcon. The words of the secret history of the Mongols were very clear. And he looked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">down and he saw her and he could barely glimpse her. But he knew she was young and she was a new bride.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And he rode back to camp. He got his two brothers and they came racing down. And they came and first the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">husband of the woman looked around and he decided to flee. Not because he was a coward, but he figured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">he would probably pull the men after him. They would chase him. And they did. They chased him. He went far</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">away. He circled around. He came back. He arrived back at the cart where his wife was. Her name was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Erlun. And Erlun had time to think while he was riding around, being chased by the Mongols. And she decided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's more important for him to live. And she told him when he came back, "You must flee. If you stay here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">they will kill you and they will take me. But if you flee, they will take me, but you will have the chance to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">another wife. There are many women in the world. You find one and you call her Hulun, after my name. And you remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">me when you're with her." It's a very dramatic moment. And he rode away. And he looked back and forth. And it said that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">pigtails or the braids that were hanging down were whipping back and forth from his chest to his back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">He was divided, obviously, in whether he should go or stay. But the three men were approaching again. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">were headed straight for the cart this time. And they came in and they took Erlun. She didn't say a word until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">he said, "Her husband was over the ridge." And when he was over the ridge and she could no longer see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">him, she began to scream and wail. And one of the brothers said to her, "It doesn't matter if you shake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the waters out of the river. And if you shake the mountains with your screaming, you will never see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">this man again." And he was right. And that was the moment that Genghis Khan's mother and father met.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the beginning of his story in this kidnapping. And it's going to reverberate. Every detail of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">will come back again and again, not only throughout the story of the life of Genghis Khan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's going to continue on with the feuds and the issues caused by it all the way into the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And to some extent, in certain parts of the world, you could say it still exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So the meeting is fundamentally sort of a mixture of heartbreak and dark criminal type of kidnapping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And from that is conceived this conqueror of the biggest contiguous empire in history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">What I was really interested in was how did this happen? Who was this person? As Wordsworth wrote in his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">poem, the child is father of the man. And it's the childhood that created him. And it's that episode</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that was before he was born. But all the things that happened throughout his childhood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">made him into the man that he became. And so he was now suddenly, this unusual situation was created,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">where a child is going to be born to a kidnapped woman who is being held by strange people, the Mongols.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They were not her people. And he already had another wife, her husband. He had a wife named Sochigo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">He had at that time already one son. Later, he had another son with her. It was a very odd situation. And in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">fact, the father, Yasuke wasn't even there when Temujin was born. He was off fighting the Tatars. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this campaign against the Tatars, he killed two Tatars. One of them was the name of Temujin Uge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">which is sort of person of iron, is what it means from the Turkic. But today, a part of also Mongolian language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So he came back, he had a baby, and he decided to name him Temujin, the person of iron, or iron man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we might call him.

So he's a kidnapped mother.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">She's a second wife now.

It was not an auspicious beginning. And in fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">just episode after episode in his childhood was inauspicious. The father and mother moved camp one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">time when he was quite young, and somehow they overlooked him and forgot him.

There was something about Temujin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">having been lost once and found by the Taichyut and reunited with the family. And now his father takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">him off at age eight.

On the step, everybody kind of figures out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">who everybody is. And they figured out who he was. And supposedly, they poisoned him. He got on his horse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and was able to ride back home.

And so, she came and she was angry that she had been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">left out.

And the banner after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">death contains the soul of the person. So she raced around and they were a little bit nervous. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">they camped for one night.

So once they've sworn this relationship of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Anda, then a couple of years later, they swear it again. But this time, they're slightly older boys,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and they have bows and arrows. And so they exchange arrows with each other. In fact, the text is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">specific that Jamukha took the horn, cut it off of a two-year-old calf, and he whittled it down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and then he drilled a hole into it in order to make a whistling arrow, which is used for several purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">among the Mongols. It's used for signals, for one thing, from one person to another. But also when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you're hunting, if you want to move the animal in a certain direction, you send a whistling arrow in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">opposite direction to make the animal move. So it had a lot of uses. So the boys had exchanged roebuck knuckles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This time, they exchanged.

He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">himself did not go. He was too old. But he sent some troops. And then Jamukha and his troops. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">basically just Temujin and his family.

That's all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They set off to find the Merkut people up the Seleng River, which flows into Siberia and on into Lake Baikal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">They had to go through some extremely rough territory.

And he's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1736" target="_blank">00:28:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">rather critical of the elder people. Wang Han's people came late and he gave them this long lecture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">about we are Mongols. And if we give our word, our word is our promise forever. And rain or sleet or snow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't matter. We be there on time. And so he's dressing down his superiors. He's very aggressive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but he's very helpful. So these troops, they move in on the Merkut camp. They also come in at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a small amount of warning because some men are out hunting sables, the Merkut men,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and they race back to the camp and they tell the people.

So Temujin comes in and there's a full moon that night so they could see what they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's really searching for her.

She knows who it is. She jumps off the cart and she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">runs to him and they're reunited and he grabs her, embraces her. And then he said, "This is the goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">This is why we are here.

He was very clear about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was his first full-on military engagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, aside from the things, yes, his first full-on military engagement. Now, along the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in addition to escaping all these horrors, he had killed his older half-brother, Bechter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And that too was a deeply formative experience.

But Bechter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">was the older child of Sochiko.

So it would have been common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that Bechter eventually, when he passed through puberty, would then perhaps marry Mother Erlun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I don't know that that happened, but I think either it did or Temujin was trying to prevent it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">because it was bad enough that he was the older brother, but he becomes the older brother and a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">stepfather. I think Temujin just couldn't handle that. And already Bechter was ordering him around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">so he would take things like a fish or a bird that Temujin had caught, and that's perfectly acceptable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Mongol hierarchy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So Temujin would catch a fish and Bechter would take the fish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.

And the fish is a symbol of that. And so here he takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">matters into his own hands.

So it was an unusual gift. And I don't—it has meaning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but I don't know all the meanings behind it.

Today, women wear belts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, but they still use the word, buskui, buskui, with no belt. So it's a very important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">symbol of manhood. So he gave that to Temujin, and they celebrated. And in the words of the secret</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">history, they slept apart under the same blanket, apart from the other group, and they were happy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">together. And then when the baby was born, Temujin named the baby Tzuch, which means visitor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people say, "Well, it's because the child was really the market child." Other people say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, it's because he was a visitor on the territory of Chamuk at that time."

The more meanings the word has, the more power that word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">has.

He said, "Kill me without shedding my blood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me die.

So, they—obviously, Temujin did not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">participate in the killing, but he ordered the killing.

The blood contains part of the soul. And if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">lose it, you're losing your soul before you die. So, they usually wrapped them up in felt carpets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and then beat them to death or trampled them to death with horses, something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a couple other methods, but I think that's probably the method by which Jamukha was killed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, he was killed. And then Temujin had—or Chinggis Khan had his remains taken up and buried in a high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">place.

So it was 1228. Chinggis Khan had died in '27. So he wrote down, it begins with what we would say are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the myths. Although I'm not sure they're myths, but the origins of the myths. It begins with the marriage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of a gray-blue wolf with a tawny deer. Then some people say, "Well, that's some kind of myth. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">totemic." And Mongols mostly, they look at me. I asked them about this. They said, "What?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">He was named blue-gray wolf.

And they think they're real people. Maybe they were or not. I don't know. But so this earlier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3636" target="_blank">01:00:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">history is just the genealogy as it should be.

So it's a confusing mess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but I tend to think it's probably accurate. He has a lot of good information. And by the time you get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the life of Temujin, the reason we know these intimate things is because that person, Shigihutuk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3673" target="_blank">01:01:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">he was there sleeping in the same gear with the people. So we even see in there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3678" target="_blank">01:01:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">he will record instances where Bersta sits up in bed and tells her husband, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3684" target="_blank">01:01:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you got to do this.

So it's a very intimate document. And this is one reason that it was secret. It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">only for the family. They were trying to uphold Tsingis Han's prohibition against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">putting out information about the family. So it was secret for a very long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So much so that scholars began to think it didn't exist. And then in the 19th century,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3711" target="_blank">01:01:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a Russian academic who was working in China at the time in Beijing, he discovered a manuscript,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">which was very, very odd that people didn't think was anything because it's all Chinese characters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but it makes no sense in Chinese.

You're not exactly sure what the name is or something like that. But it was a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3758" target="_blank">01:02:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">unusual document.

So that was very helpful to me because some of the Persians I trust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3770" target="_blank">01:02:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">very much. And I liked their work very much. And so it was helpful that it already existed. And all of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">some of it existed in Mongolian, other Mongolian sources that were written later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of it was just incorporated.

Like sometimes for a Temujin, they call him Chinggis Han. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">he wasn't the Han then.

It was not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3819" target="_blank">01:03:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">published in English until 1982, but Francis Woodman Cleaves at Harvard University translated it in the 50s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3827" target="_blank">01:03:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It was ready for publication, and he was having trouble with the publisher. And so it didn't appear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for nearly 30 years. It was supposed to be two volumes. The first volume is the translation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3838" target="_blank">01:03:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The second volume was going to be the notes, and the second volume was lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">To this day, it hasn't been found. I would love to see that. But anyway, now it's in all languages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just about in the world. Can you clarify? So there's two volumes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3857" target="_blank">01:04:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The 19th century Chinese manuscript covers the first volume.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. That was translated and then published by Harvard University. But the notes were just the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">notes from the scholar Francis Woodman Cleaves. Those were his notes, not Mongolian notes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">There are Chinese notes that went with it because the Chinese had trouble understanding a lot of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3880" target="_blank">01:04:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And they also, they disapproved of some things. So they would try to put their own notes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3885" target="_blank">01:04:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">in the margins to kind of correct the story and explain away why the Mongols women would be often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">marrying their stepson. It just did not match with Confucian ethics. You know, so there's several</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3900" target="_blank">01:05:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that that they try to skip around. But so it's interesting just to read the Ming Dynasty notes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that are attached to it. But the document itself, it's just so important. And for me, it was the guiding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3917" target="_blank">01:05:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">document. I didn't want to be guided by anything else first. Everything else I would check to correlate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and fill in blanks and give more information. But I went to Mongolia to travel around to those places,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">because they are so exact in there and to feel it. And it's so important, I think, because history does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3938" target="_blank">01:05:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">not live in books. History does not live in archives or even libraries as much as I need them for my work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But history lives in the people. History lives in the memory of the people and the culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And for example, the episode with the kidnapping of Berta. So I went to that place and I didn't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">when it happened, what season it happened. It was very important for figuring out the bursts that came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3963" target="_blank">01:06:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">afterwards and other events that were being correlated. Very important to me. And so I'm just talking to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3968" target="_blank">01:06:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the people who live in that valley, the nomads there. They said, "Oh, it's clear. It was the winter." I said, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3977" target="_blank">01:06:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">where did you read that?" I said, "No. Granny Kowalski was on the ground and she could feel the vibrations."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=3983" target="_blank">01:06:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">She said, "Look, this is summertime now.

And he was absolutely right. It could only happen in the winter. And that also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=4009" target="_blank">01:06:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">correlates with the time that raiding was done. So it correlates with other historic factors. But then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=4013" target="_blank">01:06:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that gave me the time basis for figuring out a lot of other things. History lives in the people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=4019" target="_blank">01:06:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to link on that point, you visited different places that were important to the story of Genghis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=4027" target="_blank">01:07:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Khan.

What kind of plants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=4081" target="_blank">01:08:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">are growing here. You begin to get a feeling for how he was thinking. And then you begin to see, "Ah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I know which direction they came from.

That was the age limit. The cutoff was six years old at that time. And so you had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5114" target="_blank">01:25:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">someone who's three years old racing out there.

And of course, at that age,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5120" target="_blank">01:25:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">they can't even have a saddle because it can't even be used.

The horse has been trained to do what it has to do, and they just stay on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5129" target="_blank">01:25:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But by staying on it, they learn the horse, they become one. And not just one horse with one rider,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5135" target="_blank">01:25:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">but one rider with several horses.

And this ability that you shoot, you have to defend your animals. There are wolves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5147" target="_blank">01:25:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">around, there are foxes, other things. In some areas, there were even tigers and other animals that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5153" target="_blank">01:25:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">come in.

I mean, in an earlier version,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5182" target="_blank">01:26:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you had the Huns who came out of Mongolia.

Every soldier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5474" target="_blank">01:31:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">had to be able to sew.

It was a very odd thing when you think about the army of Chinggis Khan and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5487" target="_blank">01:31:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">carrying everything themselves. They don't have any pack train behind them. And that one of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5491" target="_blank">01:31:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">they have to carry is needle and thread in order to sew up things. So complete self-reliance in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5497" target="_blank">01:31:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">regard. Yes. They also carried dry dairy products, otter it's called, where they dry curd and they can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5505" target="_blank">01:31:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">keep it for a couple of years even. But you dry it and then when you need it, you can put it in a flask of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5511" target="_blank">01:31:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">water.

It's said that the Mongols could easily go three to five days without ever building a fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5522" target="_blank">01:32:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They had enough food there. So all these little things at the lowest level were important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5527" target="_blank">01:32:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as the highest level of his loyalty, of his men to him. And it went all the way down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5534" target="_blank">01:32:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Loyalty was extremely important. And he organized the army into left wing, right wing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5540" target="_blank">01:32:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">or east and west. Mongols, the word for left is east, the word for right is west. So those two wings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5548" target="_blank">01:32:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the middle was the kol, the center, this moving center that was his bodyguard and his unit in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5557" target="_blank">01:32:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the middle. Then usually they'd have a vanguard and a rear guard. Sometimes the vanguard would go out as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5564" target="_blank">01:32:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">much as two years in advance to clear the land, run the people away, scare them, make them go away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5570" target="_blank">01:32:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">so that the grass is left there for the army when it moves through. And they never marched the way other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5576" target="_blank">01:32:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">armies do in a line of one following the other. They would always go in long lines spread out in wings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5583" target="_blank">01:33:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">so that each horse is on its own path, you can say, but all parallel together. So they had very precise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5592" target="_blank">01:33:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">ways of doing things. And this, I think, was the secret with him. And he used the best people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5602" target="_blank">01:33:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but he also, he was willing to train them as much as possible. He never punished them for what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5611" target="_blank">01:33:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So Shiki Hutuk, for example, the supreme judge, he was in command one time of a group in the battle in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5617" target="_blank">01:33:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Afghanistan, and he lost the battle, which is very, very unusual for Mongols. So Genghis Khan went out with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5625" target="_blank">01:33:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">him, said, "Okay, let's go to the battlefield together and look it over. And you explain to me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5631" target="_blank">01:33:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">what you did, and then we will talk about it." So he was very thoughtful in the way that he was training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5637" target="_blank">01:33:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the people around him. And they knew they weren't going to be punished. It's not like these countries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5641" target="_blank">01:34:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">where the general comes back and gets executed because he lost. No, Shiki Hutuk knows every general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5646" target="_blank">01:34:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to try 100%. And if they retreat, fine. They're saving Mongol lives. They know what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5652" target="_blank">01:34:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">He respects that. So all these things like that fit together. But I think a part of it that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5659" target="_blank">01:34:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">important for him… So he had this base from steppe warfare already, the horse, the archery,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5667" target="_blank">01:34:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and how that all fit together. But he was very quick to embrace any kind of other technology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5676" target="_blank">01:34:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that he saw. I think that sedentary armies, like sedentary civilizations, they get stuck in their ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5683" target="_blank">01:34:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">This is how we do it. And we're going to make it a little faster. We're going to make it a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5688" target="_blank">01:34:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">bigger, a little stronger. But this is how we think. Chinggis Khan had no sed way to think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5694" target="_blank">01:34:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And when he encountered the first walled cities around 1209, after founding his nation in 1206,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5700" target="_blank">01:35:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">he went out on these raids. And I really think they were raids, not wars at first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5705" target="_blank">01:35:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So he went into Tangut territory of what's now northwestern China in the upper reaches of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5711" target="_blank">01:35:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yellow River. So he went there. And of course, the cities have walls around them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5715" target="_blank">01:35:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a man who's never encountered a wall in his life. Well, he did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5719" target="_blank">01:35:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but they were made out of felt. The walls around his tent are felt walls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5723" target="_blank">01:35:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, just imagine what it's like for the first time in your life seeing a wall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5728" target="_blank">01:35:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">When you come from the Mongolian steppe, there's very few even natural wall-like things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5736" target="_blank">01:35:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Well, they have the wall cliffs in some places. They're familiar with that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5740" target="_blank">01:35:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and they can climb them.

And like we said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5756" target="_blank">01:35:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">for a Mongol, anything that moves is a potential weapon.

Well, they did it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5777" target="_blank">01:36:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and they didn't know exactly what they were doing, and the embankments weren't high enough. And too much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5783" target="_blank">01:36:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">water came in from the Yellow River and actually flooded out the Mongol camp. But, okay, it happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5790" target="_blank">01:36:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We learned that lesson.

And that became a strategy that actually worked for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=5796" target="_blank">01:36:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the Mongols for the next 50 years, all the way to Baghdad.

And all of a sudden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=8581" target="_blank">02:23:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">he raises them up above scholars.

For example, they get to be taxed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=8588" target="_blank">02:23:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">one time.

So trade was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=8625" target="_blank">02:23:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">extremely important. And then the Mongols, they also, they supported trade in a very odd way. And that is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=8633" target="_blank">02:23:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the merchants would come in and they would ask for an outrageous price for some goods, you know, much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=8638" target="_blank">02:23:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">more than they should get, waiting for the Mongols to bargain them down. And the Mongols would say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=8645" target="_blank">02:24:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'll give you much more than that."

capitalism—because this is 20th century already—versus the idea of like a philosopher king, which he saw in Kublai Khan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

So he did. He called the sons together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=12669" target="_blank">03:31:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is Zuch, the oldest boy who was born while the father was allied with his Anda,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=12677" target="_blank">03:31:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Jamukh.

There was no big education there in the family. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15325" target="_blank">04:15:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow got to college. My father told me to go. He didn't want me to go to the war in Vietnam,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15330" target="_blank">04:15:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">so he volunteered to go because there was the rule that they couldn't send two people from one family</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15336" target="_blank">04:15:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">against their will.

So I got to college and I can't say, "Oh, I was drinking and having a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15346" target="_blank">04:15:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">party and not serious."

My grades were so low overall. So it took me a long time to confess this to my wife after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15368" target="_blank">04:16:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we met. I met her. I briefly had known her in high school, but just not well or anything. But anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15376" target="_blank">04:16:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we met later, and I told her, and she just looked at me. She said, "What does a professor know? It's just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15383" target="_blank">04:16:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">professor. You can write anything you want." And she had the power to make me believe everything she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15388" target="_blank">04:16:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">said. I don't care what she said, I would believe it. And I would say, "Yeah, that's right. That's just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15394" target="_blank">04:16:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">professor." And she inspired me, but she supported me all the way through graduate school. She was taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15404" target="_blank">04:16:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">some courses of her own and she was doing graduate work, but she inspired me. But she told me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15411" target="_blank">04:16:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, "I want to write for more people than just for other scholars. I've done this dissertation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15416" target="_blank">04:16:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">a PhD, and it's just dry as the Gobi Desert." And I didn't know what to do. And she said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15426" target="_blank">04:17:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">"Just tell the story to me, but I can't see you while you tell it.

Just tell the story to me." And to this day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15440" target="_blank">04:17:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">almost every word I write has always just tell the story to her the way that she would like it. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15448" target="_blank">04:17:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I always read the books to her.

And in the last years of her life, I gave up the teaching. And we went back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15467" target="_blank">04:17:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">our original home in South Carolina and I said, "Okay, we're just going to live here and watch the ocean and do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15473" target="_blank">04:17:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that and just be worthless teenagers." And my wife used to have episodes of clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15481" target="_blank">04:18:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said, "I have no idea what caused it. It might be two hours. It might be seven or eight hours."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15486" target="_blank">04:18:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And we would talk a lot. And so, one time she said to me, she said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15496" target="_blank">04:18:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">"This disease is going to take my life, but it's taking your life." She said, "You gave up teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15502" target="_blank">04:18:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and you gave up writing." And she said, "How do you expect me to die</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15507" target="_blank">04:18:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">in peace if I know that you gave up everything to this disease?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q&t=15516" target="_blank">04:18:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">She said, "You should write."
