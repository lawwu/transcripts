I'm your host, Kelly Wilt, and today's episode is for the parents who are standing on the edge of a big decision, the ones who might feel the tug to homeschool but wonder, am I really ready for this?</p><p>And if you've ever wrestled with doubts, questions, or fears about starting this journey, you, my friend, are definitely not alone. In today's conversation, I'm sitting down with two moms who have been in your shoes. Lynn and Deedee, thank you so much for being my guest here today. Can you take a moment to introduce yourselves to our listeners, and Lynn, we'll start with you.</p><p>Hello, my name is Lynn Patti. I have been homeschooling for 13 years. Eight of those have been with CC, with classical conversations. My children, I have five children, and they go from seven to 17. My husband is a software developer, so he works at home, we homeschool at home, and our house is definitely very busy.</p><p>It's like Grand Central Station. And I am just very, very passionate about the subject, about getting moms engaged with that conversation about homeschool, where to start, what to do. I love this stuff. So yeah, Deedee, go ahead. Okay. Hi, everyone. My name is Deedee, and I have four kids from 10 years old to 17 years old to 17 years old.</p><p>My husband works at the bank, and we have been in Charlotte for about 12 years now. I used to come from corporate America background, so we lived in California, Florida, and currently Charlotte for my job moving around. So homeschooling now has really been an opportunity to just feel settled as a family and kind of reclaim my sense of motherhood, honestly.</p><p>So I do enjoy talking about this as well, because it's easier than you think to start. I like that. I like that intro to what we're going to talk about today. And, you know, during this podcast today, we're going to talk about what, quote unquote, readiness really looks like and how to prepare for homeschooling, both practically and spiritually, and how God's grace fills all of the gaps that we might feel so deeply.</p><p>If you've ever asked yourself, am I enough? Is this enough? This podcast today is for you. So if you're watching, grab your coffee or your laundry basket, because we've all been there, and settle in. And let's talk about having the courage to begin even before you feel completely ready.</p><p>So ladies, I'm going to start with this question. And Lynn, I'm going to direct this to you first. What first sparked your interest in homeschooling? And how did you know that homeschooling was the right choice for your family? Thanks, Kelly. Yeah, we were living in Los Angeles at the time.</p><p>It was 2012. And I had come from a public, I was an educator and in public schools. I was actually a music teacher. But I was like, let's go tour the local school where my daughter, Emma would go. And we went and I was definitely like, Oh, I don't think this is good.</p><p>You know, and then it's like, well, there's no way we can do private school because that's just out of our budget. And so my friend who had moved up to Washington State, she's like, you know, we're going to do this thing called classical conversations. And I was like, you know what, kindergarten isn't even required in the state of California.</p><p>Like you don't even have to like, put your kid down as a homeschooler in kindergarten. So I was like, I'll just do that. I'll just do what my friend Emily did. And that was it. Like, that was literally it. The other thing that was interesting is that the school where she would have gone for public school, their kindergarten program was like an hour and 45 minutes or something like that.</p><p>So I had a two year old and a six month old, I was like, I'm gonna literally get her ready for school, take her there, come home, turn around. I can't put a baby down for a nap. I can't do, you know, the morning nap or whatever. And I'll have to go back.</p><p>And I was like, I'll just homeschool. It's just easier. I love that. I love that. Devi, what first sparked your interest in homeschooling for your family? Well, I would say it was primarily the idea that I could reclaim my family, my family time. So I was working corporate America when that idea first came across.</p><p>It was actually at a Bible study and this mom probably wearing a jumper. I mean, that was love. It was like, you should consider homeschooling. And I was like, what? No, never. And I think that was just the first seed that was planted. And after the years of working like 70 hour work weeks and yes, in California, everything's like 45 minutes an hour.</p><p>Like it was crazy, but I didn't have the option of homeschooling at that time as early in my career. And I was like, okay, I've got to do this. But honestly, I think that time really prepared my heart to desire it more and to just sink into the gift that it is.</p><p>So what sparked my interest is I want to have more time with my family, but also I think we're just created to want to be with our kids, right? I feel like it's God's design for a mother to want to be with her kids. And homeschooling was a great opportunity to do that.</p><p>I love that. And I, I, my story resonates with you, with both of yours in that I had this desire for something different for my family. I had seen different educational options because I'm a former public school kindergarten teacher. And so I looked at them and thought, Oh, is this really what I want?</p><p>And I think it was driven by the same desire that you're expressing, Didi, where I looked at the amount of time that my kindergartners were with me during the day. And I was, I was a little jealous for that time with my own children. I agree with you that God creates us with that desire to want to be there and speak into the lives of our children.</p><p>But I have to say as a kindergarten teacher, I was a little fearful about bringing that experience into our home. So I'm curious, did you guys experience any doubts or fears before you started homeschooling? And what steps did you take to overcome them? So Didi, what about you? Any doubts or fears?</p><p>What helped me was a neighbor homeschooled and she kept telling me over and over, it's not a permanent decision. And I would say the fear was that if I do this, there's no going back, you know, like I'm in this black hole of homeschoolers that I'll never come out the same.</p><p>And, you know, that's actually a wonderful thing. But it, I was so fearful of, I'll never get the charter school that I was into. I'll never like all the things that I've worked for, to get my kids into the, you know, magnet school, they were in a STEM school.</p><p>I'll never be able to go back to that. And it was, it was a lot of just kind of letting that go and trusting that if, if God is opening this door, he can open the next one at the right time. And so really faith was a huge part of it.</p><p>And my neighbor just encouraging me, my neighbor, Nikki, she was just like, it's not permanent. You don't have to do this forever. And I think that just took the pressure off. So that was super helpful. I love that. Just the thought of a, of a neighbor who's speaking truth into you, just shows the value of good community and surrounding your good community.</p><p>Lynn, what about you? What about you? Were there any doubts and fears and what did you do to overcome those? Yeah. I feel like there were doubts and fears like before homeschool and after, you know, like, yes, agreed after you start, it's like, Whoa, I didn't even know I should be afraid of that.</p><p>Um, no, I'm just kidding. Oh, well, I'm not kidding. But anyway, yeah, I was, I was scared. I think I, I struggled with, um, being fearful of what people thought of me. Um, I, I do, I do think that I'm a little bit rebellious, but then I really do.</p><p>I'm like, Ooh, what are they going to think? You know, what is this person, this family member, this, whatever, um, that was certainly in there. Um, I doubted my ability to, to just to educate my daughter, you know, and I think what Dee said about how it's not a permanent decision, um, is really important because, you know, we aren't given 13 years and, and, and, you know, say, Oh, you have to do all of this for 13 years.</p><p>I mean, you might, but really it's today, right? It's just today. And, um, yeah, I think before I homeschooled or at the very beginning, I just had very little vision. Um, I just hadn't sat down to be like, what is the vision for this? But in the end, I think that that is how like God really wanted it to be for us.</p><p>Um, that I wasn't going to set out this, you know, big, huge thing TM. It was just going to be today and just get through today. And then if you are adding babies and adding moves or building businesses or what else, all of that stuff really only have today because a lot of those things become very uncertain.</p><p>Sleep is very uncertain. Um, so yeah, I, I had a lot of fears, but, um, I didn't know it would last so long. I really didn't like when DD was saying, um, that's like a happy surprise that I'm still here heading into year 14 and, um, we're still doing it, but, um, I definitely, I, I feel like I overcame those fears or the Lord helped me overcome those fears with community.</p><p>It was a huge, huge puzzle piece. Um, and the times that my fear or doubting was allayed was directly related to the amount of time I was spending in the word and prayer and community. Um, and my husband and I being, um, really intentional about our time together. Uh, I can't say enough about that.</p><p>I feel like I haven't heard a lot of people talk about that, but, um, yeah, just getting his, cause he does have vision. Um, and I'm not sure he was like 100% on board when we started, but he was like, Oh yeah, do your thing, babe. You know, like whatever.</p><p>Um, and then as he got more on board, his vision, I really relied on that or really rely on it even today. Yeah. I love that. Go ahead. I was just going to say, I love what you said there about vision. I feel like that's such a good word because I love the scripture.</p><p>That's like, for lack of vision, people perish. And that's something that I didn't know I needed honestly. And I was so caught up and like, but it has to be like this. It has to be school at home. I didn't realize the freedom I had to cast a vision for my family and my friend Diana.</p><p>So kind of walking closer to making that decision. My friend Diana gave me this book called teaching from rest and it gave me this vision for relationship, which is what the deeper thing I was wanting. So it just kind of came together. And yes, my husband was very much like, so we're, we're doing this.</p><p>And that was huge. It was huge to have that support and that vision, that he had as well. I agree. I agree. I think looking back now, having a spouse who could understand the reasons why I was drawn to homeschooling and who was there to say, all right, let's do this thing together.</p><p>That was key for me. I do think, thinking back on my story and where God brought me from before homeschooling, one of my fears was that, and I think one of you already alluded to this, that I wouldn't be able to replicate a school atmosphere in our home. And now that's laughable to me because I think that's not what it's about.</p><p>It's not about creating a school at home. It's about making life educational and fun. And having those experiences together, not necessarily bound to, you know, a desk sitting in a room, but that the classroom, our classroom is the world. And so I think that was one of the things.</p><p>So unfortunately, that information did not come to me until later, like what Lynn was describing, how, you know, the farther you get in, the more questions you have and the more realizations you have. And so I did at first try to prepare our home for homeschooling by making it as much like that classroom environment that I knew.</p><p>I made the mistake of reverting to my comfortable paradigm and bring that environment home. But I'm curious, as you guys began homeschooling, did you have something similar or how did you prepare your home for, you know, and your schedule, quite frankly, for homeschooling? Because when we came into homeschooling, I had a baby.</p><p>I had a squirrely four-year-old boy and a squirrely six-year-old boy who were all, everyone was full of energy and perhaps me not so much because they took all my energy. But we had to definitely do some schedule shifting and we had to think about life in new ways. So I'm curious, I'm curious, Dede, what, what was life like?</p><p>What was home like? How did you prepare for homeschooling once you guys made that decision? And then Lynn, I'm curious to hear your thoughts as well. Well, yeah, we, I felt like we always homeschooled in a way and that's kind of, I guess, the advice or encouragement I would like to give to moms, you're already doing this.</p><p>You might also be sending your child to traditional school, but I don't know of a mom that's not teaching their children the ABCs or manners or how to be kind to your siblings, you know, so you just get more of that. And what you were saying, Kelly, about the idea of bringing school home, that's definitely what I had in mind.</p><p>But honestly, the best conversations have been in between math and English and those spontaneous moments where we're just talking and learning so much and making connections about all of the subjects. We're not just focused, zeroed in on how to diagram the sentence. And we do that, but then it just, it kind of rounds out into this whole, like school, the world is our homeschool, so to speak.</p><p>So the way I prepared is I just kept doing what I was doing. We were memorizing scripture. I remember we went to the Billy Graham library when we first moved to North Carolina and it gave us this bookmark, the ABCs of the Bible. And at the time I was still taking my kids to traditional school.</p><p>My oldest had just gotten into, um, actually my second was in a STEM academy and I was like, okay, we're going to just say this on the way to school. And my kids still remember that like, oh yeah, we did do that. And that just grew and grew and grew until that was primarily, you know, what we did at home.</p><p>But, um, I feel like God just put on my heart, what I was already doing was enough. It was a good foundation. And then finding CC obviously was, was helpful because I feel like I kind of did a couple of things. I did like the unschooling. I was like, we're just going to do it.</p><p>I started with five in a row. I was like, everybody tries it. And that's all we need. But at the time, all of mine were in elementary, so it kind of worked well. But then I thought I am very all over the place. I'm a little scattered. So finding the classical conversations curriculum was great.</p><p>Cause it was like, no, we can just follow this, put my mind at rest. And it was wonderful. I don't know if that answers your question. I feel like I was all over the place. It does. Lynn, what about you? What about you? How did you guys prepare your life, your home, your schedule once you decided, okay, we're all in, this is the thing we're going to do it.</p><p>Yeah. I remember, you know, transforming our dining room and we had some built-in bookshelves. So those ended up being where all of our materials went. You know, talking to my husband about, he's got to get over to his studio, but by a certain time, because I want to start at a certain time, which now that I'm again, starting year 14, it's just so hilarious because I'm like, we, our schedule is like, you know, with all the kids and all the needs.</p><p>But, um, I did, I absolutely, I, I resonate with the wanting to bring quote unquote traditional school home. That absolutely was a thing. Um, I can remember early on, um, Emma was, I had asked her, she's, she was six and she, um, was supposed to empty the dishwasher and she took the plates and the forks and the knives and the spoons, and maybe even a cup.</p><p>And she laid them out on the floor and made this really big caterpillar. And I remember this very like Jekyll and Hyde moment where I was like, but your job was to empty the dishwasher. And then this other side, which I think is my homeschool persona was like, Oh my gosh, this is amazing.</p><p>She's so creative, like blah, blah, blah. So like the reason I bring that up is because I think, I don't know if it was that incident or another, but my husband was like, well, that was her school for today. And you know, that idea creeping in that there's just so much of every day that is school, which is what Didi was talking about too.</p><p>Um, and then, uh, being in the car is a big one, even for homeschoolers, when we are like supposed to be having these conversations in our school rooms, in our whatever, but then it's in the car where a kid asks about, you know, the pineal gland or something. And then you just go from there or the phases of matter.</p><p>These are just from yesterday. Um, you know, stuff like that. It just, it just goes. So to prepare, I think, I just think about that first time homeschooler mom. Yeah, you got to prepare. And if it means that you're going to make a desk or going to make a table or going to make it look like school, you know what, go for it because you got to go through to get there.</p><p>You know, you have to do those things to figure out what is my style. What is my vibe for lack of a better word? Yeah, absolutely. I totally agree with that. I think, you know, looking, looking back, I didn't know what I needed for our individual family until we had begun walking the homeschooling path and it took time.</p><p>And one thing that I wish that I could speak to that Kelly from 20 years ago. Wow. Is that I wish that I had given more grace to myself to discover what it was that I needed to do in order to provide the best learning environment for our family.</p><p>And I felt like almost like what Didi was saying, like it had to be like the magic switch that we did forever. And however we began, that was how we were going to finish. And now I look back and think, Oh, Kelly, you know, I wish, I wish that I'd had, and I know we all have similar regrets, right?</p><p>Now that we've walked to this path for a while, how we wish we could go back and say certain things to ourselves and, you know, communicate like have grace. It will work out, you know, just start walking and align yourself with good community, align yourself with great curriculum. And most importantly, align yourself with God's calling, um, align yourself with him and, um, allow him to speak to you and walk it out friends.</p><p>I mean, really that is, that is the thing. I'm glad that at the beginning, um, I was willing to take the steps, but there was, there were fears associated with that, that we wouldn't be enough that, um, I would do something wrong. And now I look back and think, Oh, I wish that I had more grace for myself.</p><p>I wish that I had more grace for my family. Like what you were describing when, um, where there were teachable moments that God afforded us. And maybe I stole the joy of my child because I was in this, like, Oh, we have to accomplish learning objectives. Yeah. That's right.</p><p>And now I'm like, Oh, you know what? The grace of God was sufficient even for those moments. And even in those times where, man, I love some gaps because I just didn't know the Lord has been kind to fill every single one of those for his glory. So I think we've kind of hit on another part of the homeschooling experience that kind of needs to be spoken about, and that is our families.</p><p>So how did family dynamics shift for both of you once you began homeschooling and what helped you during that time to be able to ease the transition from life before homeschooling into this brave new world that you had chosen to enter with your family? So Lynn, I'm curious your thoughts about that.</p><p>What did you guys do during that transition? You've already told us that you set up an environment, but what about with your family? Yeah. I, uh, these issues pop up real quick when you start, but, um, for me, one of the things, and I'm going to get a little bit like brass tacks here, um, is the house, the cleanliness of the house that became a real issue.</p><p>Um, I had little littles and, you know, I know some people are like, we, we are going to teach our kids to clean the house when they're four years old. And yes, of course, but I'm sorry, they just don't do a great job when they're four. Um, so, uh, we got a cleaning lady.</p><p>That was a big one. Um, we budgeted for it and we are Dave Ramsey people over here. So it came at a cost. It absolutely did. And we gave up other things, but I knew if I didn't have someone helping me with like the nuts and bolts, laundry, cleaning, whatever that I would, I, I found that my pattern was to sacrifice the homeschool to clean because when the kids are little, they do play and they play really, really well.</p><p>And so it could be nine, 10, 11, 12, one, and I'm just doing all of the doing. Um, and I was like, if we're going to be intentional about this at all, I'm going to have to take that off my plate. So I did get a cleaning lady. Um, you know, I had to switch from, I thought I was an extrovert all these years, but when you're with the kids all of this time, I'm actually like, I really needed some space.</p><p>So we also did like, um, I don't know if it was like one afternoon a week or something while the baby was sleeping, I would go out, um, by myself. I can remember sleeping in my van in the Trader Joe's parking lot for two hours or like whatever. Oh, that was you before.</p><p>Yeah, exactly. Um, this was before the phone was such a draw, like to scroll or whatever. So I really did sleep. I really just, um, needed that. Uh, I can remember getting pedicures was a big deal. I would like, you know, not once a week, but like once a month.</p><p>And, and that was like, and I would sleep during those two. Ha ha. Um, anyway, uh, yeah, I think that, uh, date nights, I've already kind of said this before we budgeted for that, found a great sitter to work with. Um, that was so important. I felt like my husband needed a space where he just had me like, just like really had my focused attention.</p><p>Um, because he was building a business, which means we were building a business together. Um, so that was part of it. But then I also needed to say, you know, Hey, what do you think about this kid or that kid? And we still do that to this day. Date nights are a big deal.</p><p>We just don't need a babysitter anymore. Cause we got like three built-in ones, which is awesome. Um, so, uh, yeah, I think so. Didi, how about you? Yeah, I, I would say what changed was, was really my attitude about it. So my kids, my older kids were like, Oh, mommy, can you please homeschool us?</p><p>Because the neighbor was homeschooled that I was referring to earlier. And I was like, what? No, you know why? Because you think it's going to be easier and it will not be, I will not make it easier for you. So, and also my husband's from Nigeria. So we have that cultural, you know, background school is so important.</p><p>Traditional school, that structure, that classroom setting, that respecting your elders and teachers. It's, it is kind of life school too, right? So the things, the soft skills that they learn in that environment are so important. And I was like, I will not homeschool you. I repeat, I will not do this for you.</p><p>And then after feeling like I could do this for a year, I could try it. I saw that my kids were just wanting it so much. They were ready to do the work. They would wake up, they would read the books. We started with a boxcar children and this is a summer.</p><p>We started like just in the summer to try it out. And they wanted to do all the experiments that this other curriculum had laid out for us on account of the books. And I just remember to this day, like very simple things that you could do at home became our classroom.</p><p>And it was just like kind of walking into what God had already laid out before me. Right. So it was more of a heart issue for me and just the attitude of I can do this well and I can, I can love Lord, I can love my kids. And it just, I don't know, it just unfolded.</p><p>I feel like the, the way that I wanted to prepare was not necessarily the best way. Like that idea of the, you're climbing a ladder, but it's against the wrong wall. And I kept thinking, no, I have to have all this curriculum color coded and, and the cleaning and everything, you know, just in order.</p><p>But I think God just said, there's another way and, um, help me understand that. So really it was an attitude. It was a heart adjustment. And that was, that was huge. Hey everyone. We want to interrupt this show to tell you more about this semester's sponsor, Judson college. Judson college is an amazing fit for a CC student because they really do focus in on our three uniques classical Christian and community.</p><p>Listen to their mission statement. They say equipping students to give their lives for the cause of Christ in the church, among the nations, and in every aspect of society. Let me tell you a little bit about what they mean when they say every aspect of society. I know sometimes we think of a Christian college and we think, okay, you're just teaching me to go into vocational ministry.</p><p>Well, guess what? We spoke with a representative from Judson college and he shared with us that it's more than just official ministry. They believe that every believer is equipped and needs to be equipped for ministry, wherever their feet land. So whether that means the marketplace or someone's church, Judson college has a wide variety of degrees for students to choose from, including 25 majors, as well as five years, bachelor's to master's programs.</p><p>And each of these programs are taught by exceptional faculty who are experts in their field and passionate about investing in the lives of their students. They want their students to leave equipped theologically and professionally for whatever career God wants them to pursue. To find out more about what Judson college has to offer, visit judsoncollege.com forward slash distinctives.</p><p>And again, thank you to Judson college for sponsoring this semester of the everyday educator. Let's get back to the show. Right. Right. I remember, um, struggling with feelings of guilt. Um, whenever we first started homeschooling, because I am a raging extrovert by nature. And I experienced something similar to you, Lynn, where I just needed to sit and look at a wall.</p><p>And I felt badly about that because I needed to decompress from a day with active, you know, wiggly squirrely children all day long who needed me, um, so much. And I think Didi, if I had been wise, like what you're describing, and I had my heart posture needed to be adjusted.</p><p>Um, because I think I was being, I was being led around by the tyranny of the urgent. And I did not allow my days to be spirit field filled. I had a rigid schedule and I was like, oh my goodness, we're math from eight to, um, eight 59. And then we have Bible.</p><p>And I just look back and I'm like, oh, you know, I wish that I wish that in preparing for homeschooling, I'd had a better understanding of what life school looks like. And the fact that I can do these things and I can make my environment perfect for what I thought would perfect would look like.</p><p>But the reality is you've got to start with your heart and then have to take steps to allow yourself grace to be that parent that your children need. And I agree with you, Lynn, like for me, like the house, like that's a big deal because suddenly, you know, you're not going out, you're in, right.</p><p>And so you're looking at things and sometimes things can try to be more important than people in our lives. And we have to cast that down. So I really applaud both of you, the wisdom that you exercise to have the right heart posture and to provide the right learning environment so that you weren't distracted by things that maybe were not the most important thing at that particular moment.</p><p>Um, I'm, I'm curious, Dede, you mentioned the box card children, one of my favorite series and a huge part. I know as I look around, like there were stacks of books, the cabinet behind me is full of books, my children have books in their rooms. And as a former classroom teacher, I really, before we discovered classical conversations, felt a tremendous amount of overwhelm because there are so many options available to us as homeschoolers.</p><p>Um, you know, and we do sometimes feel that invisible pressure to find the magic bullet that we'll use forever and ever that will make all of our children, you know, surgeon, surgeon, president. Um, and I'm curious, um, for both of you, you know, looking back, what advice would you give to parents who maybe feel similarly to how I did?</p><p>They feel a little overwhelmed by all of the curriculum options that are available. I'm curious, Lynn, what your thoughts are about that. Yeah, I think, um, you know, if you talk to anybody about homeschool for just a minute, you probably will get to curriculum pretty quickly. But then when I have in mind this, this prototype mom, who's just dipping her toe and just like, wait, is this right for my family?</p><p>I feel like curriculum wouldn't necessarily be her first thing. I mean, maybe, yeah. What worksheets do I use or something? But, um, you know, when I dove in, um, it was like, I had to, I had to kind of get my hands on it for a while before I was like, Ooh, now I want to talk about curriculum and what goes.</p><p>But what, one thing that I had a friend and this wasn't even at the beginning. So now as a friend, I will tell everyone, you know, to really sit down and create some kind of a philosophy of homeschool, you know, what, what, what do I want for these kids?</p><p>And, and maybe even if you are a researcher, even if you're not to look into the different, um, styles of homeschool, because that will inform, you know, how you, um, run your homeschool. And I do think, um, you know, our philosophy as an example, when the kids were really little, our philosophy was developing lifelong learners who love adventure and who give generously.</p><p>Um, and this is all under the umbrella of, um, the gospel, you know, obviously, maybe not, obviously I should say that, um, you know, having that philosophy can drive your curriculum choices. Then you have to sit with the kid that's in front of you and say, is this working for them?</p><p>Because we are not teaching curriculum. We're teaching children. And I say that as an avid CC mom and an avid, whatever homeschool mom, but we are teaching those little souls, those little immortal souls that sit in front of us every day, that's who we're teaching. And I have had many years where I start off earnestly in August with a plan and a curriculum and blah, blah, blah.</p><p>And then by November we're, we're changing it all up. So, um, you know, I think curriculum is, is long and deep and wide and we could get there, but just on the, on the front end of it, I would say that developing your philosophy of homeschool, why you're doing it and you know, what, what, um, outcome you want from even just the first few months or the year or whatever, that's where you have to start.</p><p>I agree. I agree. And if you're listening to this podcast and you're looking for a great place to begin, the scribblers at home curriculum actually takes you through the steps to create and craft a vision statement for your family so that you can think more deeply about your why, because I'm going to tell you right now, friends, that if you don't firmly latch onto that, why it's really easy to make a decision to just forego, um, what you've been called to do.</p><p>And so it is, I agree with you, Lynn, it's so important to understand your family's why so that you have a target. You're not shooting an arrow and then drawing a bullseye around it, but you have a target for why, um, you're making the decisions that you are. Um, Dede, I'm curious, you've already alluded to this a little bit, but, um, there is a lot of preparation for homeschooling that is invisible.</p><p>And I know the theme of practicum this season is seeing the unseen. So I'm curious if you would allude a little bit more about spiritually, how did you prepare for your calling to homeschool? Um, were there steps that you took with your husband or individually that you felt prepared you well, um, or at least prepared you?</p><p>I'll say that because we've all learned things after the fact, um, as well, or beginning homeschooling with your family. Yeah, I would say it's abiding in the word. I think it's understanding that no matter what you're doing, you are teaching your children. If I'm spending my morning on YouTube, looking for the perfect block schedule for my kids, I'm teaching my kids that you need to go to YouTube and find the perfect schedule for yourself.</p><p>Instead of putting up my Bible, reading the word, letting it wash over me, maybe pausing at a verse and saying, Oh, that's interesting. While I'm at the table and my kids are eating breakfast and saying, Oh, that's, that's interesting. And then speaking about it, you know, all of those things are teaching our children.</p><p>So I feel like just abiding in the word and prayer was the most important part of preparing me spiritually. I think the Lord gave me this verse in Ephesians 5 16 that says, um, something to the effect of redeeming the time for the days are evil. And it sounds kind of like looming, you know, I'm like the days are evil.</p><p>We will homeschool, you know, it's like my vigilante over here, but it was more, it was more about, you know what, let's, let's see what we can do to actually love the Lord and love family and his purpose for us through homeschool. And so I love what you said to Lynn about the, why is so important.</p><p>If you have that, why, if you care, the curriculum will follow all those things will happen. And even when you're not bound to the curriculum, right. When you're just sitting in between subjects or it's lunchtime, what you do with yourself, that's still teaching your kids is important. So if you have a worship song, you want to play that matters.</p><p>Um, so I just, I think in preparation, it was, I just had that verse, um, kind of ready on my heart and ready to share. And then just continuing to look for ways to be with my kids and see where they are spiritually as well. So I feel like to start, you just have to be with your kids.</p><p>You, you have to sit with your kids. It's the time that you invest in them. And I had a friend who had homeschooled many years before me. And she said, it's not about choosing the right curriculum or finding the right books. Like you were saying, Kelly, it's not a silver bullet.</p><p>It's that you use the books you have. And that really struck me because I was always searching, always looking for the next great curriculum that was shiny with the stickers. And you go to all these fairs and you're like, no, that one is better. Just use the things you have, use the tool you have.</p><p>We have the Lord, we have our children, we have our husband, right? Supporting us. So when you use that, I feel like you do feel more equipped to do the tasks that you're called to do. Yeah. When I started, I, I'm just thinking about what you said, Didi. I don't think I really understood God's word and the truth of Christianity.</p><p>I don't know if I really understood how important that was in our homeschool. I feel like the last two to three years as my older ones are getting older and like, you can start to see them, you know, as adults in the real world, which is like a whole other thing.</p><p>But I'm like, there's only one thing that matters. Like, it's really true. Like all of those mamas, you know, who were old when I was young and they would say, it's really the only thing that matters. I don't know if I had ears to hear that at the time, but man, I do now.</p><p>And I just, if there's anything that I could say today, it would be that, you know, that the truth of Christianity, that God's word is actually the most important foundation for these kids. Yeah. You know, what's amazing about that is that they see us growing as well, right? They can look back and say, I remember when mom was so into this one curriculum and so on edge about this and our test scores.</p><p>And then, you know, it just became about really good conversation about who God is and they feel the difference in their bodies and they take that with them. And so it is an all around school. Like we're all becoming educated. We're all growing and that's the fruit of homeschooling and in community because your testimony, what you're sharing encourages me that it's still happening wherever we are today.</p><p>Right? Like even now there's, there's something, there's a place God is still taking us and taking these families that are listening. They might not know exactly where, but that's okay. You'll get there. Absolutely. Absolutely. I think we've already alluded to this a little bit and the fact that God's word sustains us, um, that as believers, we homeschool because that is the main thing and keeping the main thing can be difficult and sometimes overwhelming, um, even discouraging.</p><p>So I'm curious, you know, a lot of the people who are listening to this, this conversation might think like, Oh, there are going to be so many mountaintop moments as homeschoolers. And there are, but there are also some valleys that we experienced. And I'm curious, um, if both of you would speak to that a little bit, have there been moments where perhaps you were discouraged because you were doing the right things and you were doing them well, but you got weary, or there was something that maybe was a setback for you during those times.</p><p>Um, and maybe both can allude as much as you're comfortable with, um, how did your faith sustain you? How did your walk with the Lord sustain you through those times? Um, and Lynn, you can go ahead and lead off with that. Um, yeah, I mean, the answer is yes.</p><p>Discouragement is like, it's just part of the, part of the plan. And so, yeah, I mean, there's been health things, business, uh, disappointments, there's been, um, financial strain. Um, there was a brief period where I sent my kids to a private Christian school because I was burnt out, burnt out, burn out is a real thing.</p><p>Um, all of the things, all of the things, um, and you ask, you know, how did my faith sustain me? I don't know if I could tell you how it sustained me. I just know that it did. And that, um, I was thinking about like, I was thinking about that whole concept where we're putting God in the center of, of all of the education.</p><p>Right. And so my faith is, it's not an ingredient in how to make a great homeschool cake. It's like, it's like the house where you're making the cake. It's like the world, like it's so much bigger than an ingredient. And I think when I first started, I thought that faith was an ingredient.</p><p>I thought that the Bible reading the Bible of my kid was a box to check or something, which don't get me wrong. Sometimes it is. They got to check a box. Okay, fine. But that's because we're building the discipline. But now looking back to those early years is like faith was everything.</p><p>It was everything. Um, and, um, I think, I, I don't know if we could put a little bit of a finer point on the idea that faith isn't necessarily the curriculum that we're teaching our kids, but it is that overarching thing. Um, because I know if I were listening to this and I was a mom, like, Oh, I want to homeschool those little old ladies who sit and they say, it's all about Jesus, this is my heart, you know, well, it is, but it, it, it also is about like, well, what the heck do I do?</p><p>You know? Um, uh, we can speak to that, but I know that, right. You know, for this, um, what's germane to this point is that faith is really everything. It really is. I love the idea of, you know, it being the house, like it is, it is, it is where and how we do what we do.</p><p>What about you, Dede? So, yeah, I will echo what Lynn said. Yes. The times of discouragement are there and they're still here. Um, and how did my faith sustain me again, similar to Lynn? I, I don't really know how, I don't even know that I knew it was happening when it was.</p><p>It's just the fact that I, I got through another day. Yes. And I, I wasn't going to bed like, wow, my faith really got me through today. It was like, it was like, Oh my goodness. Are we ever going to make it? And then you turn around and you're like, Oh wow, this actually, these things were okay.</p><p>Like the gaps that I thought were so big and so wide and that I thought I needed to fill. God was filling that God was doing that. And you look around and you have people that have also poured into your kids because of community homeschooling and community. I can't say that enough.</p><p>God designed us for community. And so that's where I feel like my faith, I was carried because other people saw the fruit that my kids were bearing and would say, Hey, your son did a good job with this. Or your daughter, you know, really stepped up in this way.</p><p>And I was like, Oh, they did. Okay. So, so it's okay. And I think those are the moments that really encouraged me to keep going because you really can't fill all the gaps. You just can't, it's impossible, but it's a reminder to rely on God even more because that it is the house.</p><p>It's where we live. That's right. That's right. I love that. I love that. I'll carry that metaphor with me throughout the rest of the day. Absolutely. Um, you know, I look back on the beginning of our family's homeschool journey and I think about the person I was, um, at that place that although I had a formal education to be an educator, um, there were ways that I still felt woefully inept, um, because I was used to educating solo in a classroom, um, by 25 little people who were all the same ages.</p><p>And, you know, at the end of the day, guess what guys, they went home and then I would go home and then I could breathe and relax. And so, you know, coming into homeschooling and realizing that, you know, they're with me all the time and they're not, they're not going away.</p><p>But also a mega adjustment for me. So when, when we began homeschooling, um, I was grateful for the blessing of community because, um, you know, there were other individuals who could speak truth into my life, who can maybe keep an eye on my children for five minutes so that I could have a conversation with a friend or go to the bathroom.</p><p>That's right. Most importantly, go to the bathroom, get a snack, breathe, talk in complete sentences, all those things. Um, I am curious when you guys first began, um, and I already know the answer to this because one thing that I have not told you listeners is that both of these dear ladies are my friends, my personal friends and directors in the community in which I participate.</p><p>So we know each other pretty well. Um, initially when you started this process, did you guys seek out a homeschooling community, recognizing that you needed that support? And I'm curious how the supportive community continues to shape your journey as homeschoolers now, because you've both already said you have younger children, but you also have older children.</p><p>And I know for me personally, we're at the end. It makes me teary. We're at the end of our homeschooling journey as a family, at least with our three children that God has given to us. Now there may be opportunities to homeschool grandchildren down the line. So we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.</p><p>But, um, you know, I'm curious, like how has community shaped your journey? Um, Dede, when you first came into homeschooling, did you immediately navigate toward a community or did you try to go it alone or how did that work out for you? I'm curious. Well, I initially started in the summertime with our, um, you know, just the books that we were reading.</p><p>So we started with the boxcar children and the curriculum I used said, here's how you can pull out a science lesson from that. But I will speak to the idea of community can just be one person. Community can be that neighbor friend that I had said, you can do this because I had relationship with her already.</p><p>And so community doesn't have to be this big group of people that maybe you don't really know. It can be that one person who has walked alongside you and says, I know you, I know your kids. I see what you're doing. You can do this. And it also helped being able to just watch her homeschool and step into her room every once in a while and say, Oh, you guys are doing math.</p><p>Here's what it looks like. I wasn't necessarily seeking out community. Let's say it just kind of found me. And I think, again, that's the Lord leading me to this because I didn't even know what, you know, like whoever's listening. This is great that you're listening to this. I just, you know, I was like, Oh, okay.</p><p>You can do this or that. And they just, I feel like it just found me. And then ultimately classical conversations was that broader community. But even within the broader community, I found relationship like with you guys. And when I was weary and I was low, I could just reach out and say, okay, how do we do this?</p><p>Or how are you doing? And then encourage each other. And I think it's also interesting to how God will allow someone to come across your path that also has a need. So when we're feeling depleted and low, there's someone that needs advice or a word. And you're like, you know what, you could do this, this, this.</p><p>And suddenly you're not so low, right? Like it's just the way that we can see others as well that have needs. We all have needs. So I don't know if that answers your question, but yeah. It does. What about you, Lynn? Were you naturally drawn to community at first or did you start this alone?</p><p>I'm just curious because we're all three in community together now. And I know we've had conversations about community and the value of it. So I'm curious what your experience was. Yeah. I can remember when my oldest was four, four months, four months old. My, um, I think it was through a sermon I heard or something.</p><p>I was like, I'm starting a mom's group. So we had a mom's group from the time she was four months old. And that really informed my sort of like collection of knowledge about community. Um, it was not homeschool. It was just getting through that first year of life. A lot of talking about birth stories.</p><p>That's part of that first year of life is processing through that, which is wonderful. Um, and then, um, so community to answer the question first and foremost is always been a part of my motherhood journey. Um, and then, so when my friend Emily said, well, we're up here, she, she lives in a different state, but we're doing CC.</p><p>And I was like, Oh, I'll just do that. Um, it was, I think as I look back on natural outcropping of what I had already been doing that, obviously I'm going to need to meet with some ladies once a week. Like that's just part of my rhythm and routine.</p><p>Um, I will say that we did CC for five years, the first five, and then we moved and, um, we didn't move far, but we moved far enough that I couldn't continue attending that community. And where we moved to, uh, there was no space for, they had four or five communities and they were chock full.</p><p>And so I could not be a part of community. And so then it got taken away from me. And then I realized like, it was like oxygen. I was like, this is really difficult to do this without community. And I will say just the way that timeline works there, um, that not being in community for me led me to, um, that fall where I, I did send my kids to Christian school, which is, it's totally fine.</p><p>I understand, but I just know that, um, the burnout of having no one around feeling alone, I'm in a new town. Um, it was enough to, to kind of, to get me really low. So, um, you know, after the, the Christian school stuff, it was COVID. So then it was like, well, obviously nobody's in community right now.</p><p>I mean, family became community, family was community. Um, and so when the opportunity arose in 2021 for us to be a part of a community, I jumped on it all 10 toes, like let's go. Um, because I knew that that would, would be life sustaining. And then moving to North Carolina again, I was like the first calls that I made when I knew we were coming here were to find a community.</p><p>Absolutely. Absolutely. I would say if you are a parent who is standing on the edge, the precipice of homeschooling and you're thinking, you know, what are, what are the first steps that I need to take? I think that both of these ladies have, have alluded to the fact that you need to be in relationship, um, with either with your community of one, as Didi said, so, so lovely.</p><p>We all begin with a community of one. There's one person perhaps who shares with you or encourages you, but then also getting to a place where you recognize the need to come into community and be surrounded by others who perhaps have the same mission or have the same goals.</p><p>I would strongly encourage you to seek out a practicum near you this summer. Um, you know, I know that practicum is a great time where you can get together and you can sit across the table and have conversations with others who are contemplating the same things and where you can feel a camaraderie.</p><p>Um, just like I feel with both of these wonderful friends. Um, just knowing that you can have conversations about these things, what God's calling you to what this looks like when it's fleshed out in your own home. So definitely go to classical conversations.com and do a search on the events tab that's on that page and see if you can locate a local practicum to attend so that you can begin to taste the first fruits of community, um, with others who are similarly called.</p><p>So as we start to wind down this podcast, um, we could, we could probably record two or three hours, just a conversation together. Um, and you know, we are, we, we have talked about several things. We've talked about the importance of being connected, um, you know, spiritually to the one capital O who has called us to this, the importance of being connected to community, the importance of preparing yourself physically, mentally, spiritually, for what God has called you to.</p><p>And I'm curious, um, both of you, um, I know personally have a rebellious streak. So I would love to, um, as we wind down this podcast, talk about what does being ready for homeschooling really mean? And I say being ready in air quotes and what are myths about readiness now that you're farther down this journey that you'd like to debunk.</p><p>Um, and I'm going to lead off by saying that you will never be feel a hundred percent percent ready. And that is God's gift in your life. Um, because I think looking back, if I had felt 100% ready, what need did I have for God to sustain me daily?</p><p>Um, don't negate his work, your reliance on him by feeling like you are self-sustaining and that you're self-sufficient and have all of the answers because homeschooling, what you will quickly discover is a walk of refinement. You begin thinking it's a refining for your children, but then somewhere along the way, you also discover that it's a refining for you as you redeem your own education academically and spiritually.</p><p>So I'm curious, Didi, is there a myth you'd like to debunk about readiness? Wow. Um, I guess it sounds so simple. I almost want to say it. You just, you just have to care. You just have to, it's a heart decision, honestly. Like I know I've said that before, but if you care about your kids, the fact that you're listening to this, whoever's listening to this, you're ready because you want to know more.</p><p>You want to understand that's what it takes. Cause that will continue to lead you to the right curriculum and the right community and all those things because you care about how your kids are being educated. So I feel like maybe the myth I'd like to debunk is that you have to have everything set up beforehand.</p><p>Um, that is a myth. You do learn as you go as with everything. I mean, if you were to take an archery class, you don't have to know how to do it before you start, you show up. So you just show up with your kids, you show up with your heart in the right place with the Lord and you will homeschool your kids.</p><p>So I love that. I love that. All right. Then another myth to debunk. Yeah. I mean, I can't echo enough. You'll never be ready. You'll never be enough. It's all, all the things like, um, but I think that there is value in saying, um, that, you know, when, when the babies were little, right.</p><p>They would be like in, in some new stage. Right. And I would be like, Oh, well, she usually takes a nap between dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Or she usually really likes this food or whatever. And I figured out so quickly that we just aren't going to do that anymore.</p><p>We're just not going to say what she usually does because that'll be the day where she doesn't. And, and if I have some preconceived notion about what she's supposed to do or usually. So, I mean, roll that into homeschooling your kids. It's just like what you might think it's going to happen.</p><p>It won't what you think your schedule is going to be. It won't. And so that idea of just like holding your hands open to what the Lord wants to do. And I agree with you. You can't be a hundred percent ready. I don't even know I'm going to be 50% ready, you know?</p><p>Um, cause you really do just need that space for flex for, you know, that kind of thing. And one thing, I don't know if this is a good place to say it, but I think I misunderstood timing. I think I misunderstood with a kindergarten student that, um, how much time would be like the school part.</p><p>Um, and I think I had preconceived notions that it was hours and hours because that's what my idea of school would be. I, I send them away. Well in California, not for kindergarten, but first grade it's all day. And you know, that I, I feel like that's one of the things I tell people.</p><p>It's like, you spend 45 minutes with your kindergartner, like that's it. And they're like, wait, what, you know? And, and I was that same way. And so, you know, are you ready to do 45 minutes a day with your kindergartner? I mean, that's a lot less of a commitment than six hours of school, you know?</p><p>And, and by the way, if you do try to do two, three, four, five, six hours with your first grader, everyone's going to cry. Everyone. Um, so just, yeah, it's really the pressure there. When you talk about the, having grace with yourself, like that's, that was a great thing to learn is like, it's real easy to check the school box.</p><p>If it's 45 minutes, when you start, when they're little. Absolutely. Absolutely. Wise advice. I want to thank both of you for joining me today. And as we get ready to say our goodbyes to you, listener, um, I have one more question for both Lynn and for Didi. I'm curious.</p><p>And we've, we've already talked a little bit about if we had a time machine to go back in time and talk to that version of ourselves who was in the place. Some of our listeners are contemplating this decision. If you can, if you can get in a time machine and go back and tell yourself one thing now with your years of experience, what's the one thing you would tell your considering homeschooling self?</p><p>Yeah. I would repeat what my neighbor said. Just try it. Hmm. It doesn't have to be permanent. Just try it. And that was the biggest gift. So that's what I would say. So good. What about you, Lynn? What would you tell yourself? I would tell myself that having them home with me is more valuable than, um, any other thing that I could be doing with them, like sending them to school or sending them to preschool or whatever it is, just having them home and doing no school is even more valuable.</p><p>Um, that time together, when Didi talked about reclaiming her family time and stuff, uh, that just is, it's very true. Um, that the first step into homeschool is just gathering your kids and having them close to you. Yeah. Thank you both for joining me today for the everyday educator and listener.</p><p>We want to thank you as well for joining us. And if you're still wondering whether you are ready, ready to homeschool, God does not always call the equipped. He equips those he, he has called. And we've already spoken about this at length today, but remember readiness is not about having it all figured out.</p><p>It's just not because I will say as a 20 year homeschooler, veteran of homeschooling, I still don't have it all figured out, but I do rely on him for the grace that I need. It's about willing, being willing to trust, learn and grow every day alongside your children. So Didi and Lynn, I'm going to thank you both for sharing your heart with our listeners today.</p><p>And we hope today's conversation gave you some encouragement, practical insight, and a reminder that you, my friend are not alone in this journey. So if this episode was a blessing to you, would you take a moment to share it with a friend who might also need some encouragement along their homeschooling journey until next time, keep learning, keep growing and keep educating every day.</p><p>Goodbye, friends. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. you you you you you you you We'll see you next time.</p></div></div></body></html>
