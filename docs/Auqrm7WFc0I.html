This won't be a super zippy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">get-it-done-fast thing, but I want to just kind of go through things a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">gently and slowly and carefully, and show you around to help you get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It will probably help if you've done a little bit of web programming before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'll try to introduce everything as we go to make it as accessible as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let's get started. So this is the FastHTML homepage. I imagine you've seen this already,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">given you found this video. And on the homepage, you can see some quick examples of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what FastHTML looks like. So here's some code on the left. This is pretty short. And on the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is what it renders. In this case, it's all being done by a Python component called Card3D.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these kinds of components, you can wrap them up, they can contain styles, they can contain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">JavaScript behavior and so forth, or they can be combined out of other Python components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">FastHTML websites are dynamic, they're running on a server, but they are interacting with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">browser via JavaScript automatically on the whole. So these are the actual temperatures in America</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right now, as I talked to you. They're coming from an API function here. And so we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have dynamically updated weather on our homepage. And as you can see, it doesn't take very much to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">do that in terms of the code for it, assuming you've got the weather API hooked up, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The kinds of components that you can create can be kind of server-side data-driven APIs like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or they can be kind of GUI-type components like this. So this is like an example of an accordion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, it's written in Python, it's accessible from Python. And so not the most exciting looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, but this is actually, again, a dynamically generated in real time on the homepage. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the actual code for it coming from a database. As you can see, it's as simple as saying db.create,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can define it in basically one data class, or it's not even a data class, just one regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Python class to say what the data is. And then to convert a table into an unordered list, you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">say unordered list, and here's the table. So as you can see, this kind of thing really is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">easy to get started with. One good way to get started is to look at lots of examples of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">writing stuff. So we've got four examples here on our homepage, so you can check these out as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But today we're going to get started on our own. There is a lot to learn when it comes to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">learning to do web programming. There's a lot less to learn with fastHTML than with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">most current approaches. But you can't expect to just jump in and start coding right away without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing any basics. So to help you learn the basics, we have this learn more here, which takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you to this mini site, which talks about the kind of basic principles of fastHTML, all the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">technologies that it's built on, you know, the component, the foundations, the technology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">how components work. And so this is a good place if you want to understand more of the concepts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how this is all put together. It was interesting when I built this page is I kind of thought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like, hmm, how am I going to do this? It would be nice to build it with fastHTML. I wonder what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that would look like. And it actually worked out really nicely. I had it basically written in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple of hours. So here's the actual source code for that page. As you can see, I've just got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">markdown, and I just created this little markdown wrapper here. So this is basically the code other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">than the prose to generate that page. And so you might be thinking, okay, well, how does markdown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">work? Well, the nice thing is, because we're using Python here, the markdown function I wrote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">simply calls something that I found on PyPy, which is the Python markdown library, and wraps it up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in a div. So, yeah, as you can see, it's kind of like, you can create all kinds of different types</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of applications and pages and sites in fastHTML without necessarily needing, like, special purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">blogging systems or whatever. Maybe I'll show you one more example of something I wrote the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">day, which I quite like, is I find it really helpful often to have a markdown version of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">documentation, so I can kind of provide it to a language model, for example, if I'm using Claude</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or ChatGPT. So often I find I want to, well, let's look at an example. So if we go back to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about page, let's say we wanted to include this as context in a, for a ChatGPT or Claude</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation chat. You wanted a markdown, so if I wrote this little thing, so I can copy the URL,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">paste it here, say load, and you can see here it is loaded up. And it's kind of cool, because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I want to, for example, get rid of the navigation, and so you can see here I can, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">grab, okay, that's the whole div, there's the nav section, and that looks like this is the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here we are, this is the main content. So I can just close up the whole nav section, select it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">delete it, and then we could probably get rid of the footer. Delete it. There we go. And so once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done that, I can then immediately, you can see underneath, look, there's the markdown right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">here, and then I can copy it, and all done. And so you can see here it's an interesting kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">combination of, like, you know, a JavaScript component, and, you know, everything happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically. As soon as I click load, as soon as I edit something here, it automatically changes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So if I remove the word using, say, and you can see, yep, it's gone. So, yeah, these are kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of applications that can be quite interactive and incorporate JavaScript and Python functionality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">together, and styling, and so forth. So you'll also see here the link to the documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully by the time you read this, there'll be even more, but we've got a kind of a bit of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">quick getting started here, and maybe the best way to learn is through examples. So we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of examples of, you know, end-to-end. This one's actually got one, two, three, four, four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">full examples. Image generation, chatbot, multiplayer game of life, so forth. All right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so let's get into our own example now. So I've just literally got a totally empty nothing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't need to start with any kind of skeleton or anything like that. We'll just create a file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and we call our main file main.py. And we're ready to get started. So one way maybe to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">get started here is, okay, you need to pip install it. Obviously I've done that already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And here is our minimal app. So why don't we just copy that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we will paste it, but I can even make it more minimal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll explain the components in a moment. But for now, let's just run it. So python main.py.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so as you can see, it now says application startup complete, and it tells me here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the link that I have to go to to see my website. So all these applications are running in the web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And here is my website. Hello, world. Okay, so what actually happened here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so fastHTML, we try to make it as easy as possible to get all the symbols you'll need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for most fastHTML apps. So we've got this special common namespace here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty common when using kind of widget frameworks and so forth to just say import star.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That way you just get kind of all the divs and p's and everything else you need. So that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I prefer to do. An alternative that works also pretty well is to say from fastHTML import common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as fh. And so in that case, then it's going to be fh.fastApp, fh.div, fh.p, fh.serve. So one kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">nice thing about that is that you can immediately kind of see all the different options that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you have, which could be helpful. And so if I save that, you can see as soon as I save it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it automatically reloads. So that's handy. It doesn't automatically, by default,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">reload the website itself. So to make it auto-reload, I add live equals true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Save that. You'll see it automatically restarts the application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll refresh this once in order for it to read. Notice that it's now live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So now that I've done that, I should be able to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I am alive. And I'll hit save. And you can see as soon as I do, it updated itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's actually happening here, let's just go back to how it was. I find that a bit more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">convenient. So one good way to understand what's happening here is to take a look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what's actually happening in the application. So one good way to do that is to open up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">developer tools, which you can see here. And as you can see, it's command option i on my computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And here I've got the network tab. If I refresh this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see it's loading up a whole bunch of JavaScript. That is all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">happening automatically. But the most important thing is this actual very first thing that gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">called, which is to see what's actually going on here. And so what's actually going on here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is it's going to my web browser has asked for the page at localhost colon 5001. And so you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the request, localhost 5001. And what's it asking for? It's asking to get the page. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this is called the HTTP method. So this HTTP method is get. There's a number of HTTP methods</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll use. And all we do is we name the function with the same name as the HTTP method we want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you just go to a website, you type it into a URL and you hit enter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">your browser always calls get. And in this case, I didn't put any path up here. So that means that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got the default path, which is just slash. So here's the whole URL that it got.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what happened after our browser asked for that information? Well, it hit our web server,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which is running here. We've written serve. So that causes our web server to start. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this here is our router. Our router is created when we ask for a fast HTML application by writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">fast app. We get back two things. We get the application object and we get the router.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we say, OK, for the router, when you get a request for slash, so that's the default</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">root level request, and it's a get request, I want you to do this and send this back to the browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we got that request. Our web server ran. And you can see here the response it gave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's more than just what we asked for. Here's the bit we asked for, which was a div</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and a paragraph with hello world. And so fast HTML for us has auto generated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">an appropriate header. And also this little bit here, which is added for the live reloading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">functionality. Let's start to make this look a little bit better. So there's a number of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">little conveniences in fast HTML. It would be nice if the title of the page was something other than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just fast HTML page. And it'd be nice if it looked a bit better. So there's a little convenience we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have, which is just to say titled, which means return a page with some particular title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is our greeting page. And so the title requires two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">As you can see here, it requires the title and then a bunch of things for the page itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in this case, we just got the original page. So if I save that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">here it is. So we've now got the title. It also appears as an h1. And you can also see that now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've done that, it's made it look a little bit better. The reason it's looking a bit better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is that by default, we use something called Pico CSS, which is a nice little minimal style sheet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">type thing. And so here's some examples of what it looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in Pico, everything has to be wrapped in a container. And so that's part of what thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that happens automatically. And that's why it's starting to look a little bit better than it used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to. To see how these things work, they're generally very little code. So I can just jump to it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here's titled. And you can see that all it does is it's just returning a title, an h1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Whatever I asked it to display, it's setting the class to what Pico wants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's wrapping the whole thing in main.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can see here that main is actually itself a HTML element. So basically things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are here, which are not specifically defined, are generally going to be HTML elements,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ditto with title. FastHTML automatically handles making sure that if you've got a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">HTML header like title, it puts it in the right place for you. And so you can see that all works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">nicely. Okay, so maybe let's start adding a bit of interactivity. So behind the scenes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of what we do is going to rely on this really nifty little library called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">htmx. Htmx is something which basically removes some constraints from your web browser. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">allows the web browser to do things which, I mean, when you learn about them, you realize,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, they just make a lot of sense. They probably should have been how web browsers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">were built in the first place. And maybe in the future, web browsers, there's thoughts that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">might actually change to support some of the stuff in htmx directly. But for now, we have to use htmx.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So FastHTML adds that automatically. And htmx is something where we can basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">respond to these HTTP requests on the server and do all kinds of things with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's look at the most simple kind of HTTP request, which is to create a hyperlink.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And so this hyperlink says /change on it. So if I save this, you'll see here now we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this link. And if you look at the bottom of the screen, it's going to say change. And if I click</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">on it, it says not found. And that's because I don't have a root for /change at the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go and create one. So to create one, I just say create a root for /change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Change is good. I don't know. Whatever. Okay. Save that. And so now, when I go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">localhost colon 5001 /change, it'll return this. Well, that should be get, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm using this thing called cursor, which sometimes tries to use AI to change things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically, and it doesn't always know what to do. There we go. Change is good. So go back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">click the link. Excellent. And so we could, for example, add an additional one here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which just goes back to /. So now we can link. Maybe put this all in titled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, we could just put it just directly here. Titled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Save that. Link. There we go. So you can see, using this way, we can create a website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know? And our website can do Pythony kinds of things. So, for example, numbers equals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, maybe we'll do something like, well, let's make them as a list,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So we'll create an unordered list of list items.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Row and range 10. That sounds good. So we'll put that all into a list comprehension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And in FastHTML, when you pass lots of things like that, you want to use star to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">unpack them. So it's going to send them all across as separate arguments to the UL call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So UL is an unordered list. And so maybe now we'll change that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there they are. So to explain what's going on here, you can see that the HTML that we have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so the HTML that we have has like a UL and all these LIs, P, A, so forth. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we're using Python functions with the same name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">P, A. And so that's part of what FastHTML is providing to us. So this means that we don't need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">templates or like anything like JSX or anything like that. Because everything's just Python,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we can just, you know, do this stuff quite easily. So for example, if we wanted a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">function to create lists of any size, you know, we could factor this out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">into like a numbered list component. We'd pass in, say, 10 to say that's what we want to get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">number list going up to. So it goes up to i and make it range i. So let's change that now to 15,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">say. Save. And you can see there, it's now going up to 15.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But not the most exciting component, but you can kind of hopefully get the idea here that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we can add more and more interesting components. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that about page that you saw earlier, these kind of components, you know, that do things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">creating the hamburger menu automatically and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">making sure that our captions wrap well and adding this little auto updating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">thing on the table of contents. So that's all being provided by a framework called Bootstrap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the source code for the about stuff is very small, as we've seen before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the key reasons for that is that the work is being done by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a Bootstrap component library. So things like this navbar, for example, that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">make it bold, basically depending on where you go to and so forth, are all happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">inside here. So let's see, we've got -- here's our navbar, for instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's still all written in Python, which is nice, but, you know, it takes a bit of work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to figure out how Bootstrap works and figure out how best to, you know, present it. So it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">nice when somebody else does that for you, and then you can use Bootstrap directly from Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">without thinking about it. So that's the kind of goal of this -- that's kind of the goal of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this approach here of being able to create these Python components. Okay. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">not a particularly exciting application so far. And it's not really taking advantage of it at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">all. Like, when I click this, it's giving us a whole new page, and that's not really how modern</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">JavaScript -- modern web applications tend to work. Things tend to happen kind of in place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So to show you how we can change that, we create a div here. We'll give it an ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we're going to do is we're going to make a change here to this hyperlink.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to change it from an href to hxget. Hx is what htmx uses. Normally it uses hyphens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We use underscores anywhere you'd normally see a hyphen, because Python is not happy using hyphens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in parameters. Okay. What happens when we say hxget instead of href? Well, what actually happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is that htmx will call this in the usual way, and it's going to call get, because we said we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">want to get. But it doesn't replace the whole page. Instead, it replaces or inserts or changes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the existing page DOM, the existing page in some way. So actually, probably an even better way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do this is I'm going to -- really simple. I'm going to put it on this div itself. And so this is one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the interesting things about htmx is that it lets you respond not just to clicks and hyperlinks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but to literally anything. In this case, it's going to be a click on a div. It could respond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to a scroll or a movement of a slider or a mouseover or anything you like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So when we click on this div containing these numbers, it's going to call /change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then by default, what it's going to do is it's going to replace the contents of the div.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to change the contents of the div with, say, this paragraph. Change is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So I'll say save. And then I'm going to click on this div.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you can see, it's changed it to say change is good. So what actually happened there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">might be interesting to look at the actual what's happening over the network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to -- so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say refresh. Okay. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the usual page. Looks exactly like it did before. And so it's the usual page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Just contains all this HTML. Okay. Now, what happens when I click on it? So I'm going to click.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happened when we clicked on that is it's called localhost/change. It called it with a get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The response was exactly what we asked for. It's just the paragraph. But as you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it actually updated the page. And so the reason for that is because we used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">htmx. Now, behind the scenes, it doesn't really matter how it's actually doing that. But if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">interested, behind the scenes, it's because htmx adds various headers to tell it what to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which is that's how it all happens automatically. So you can see here that we now have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the start of an application which is doing kind of dynamic calculations on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">server side and updating the kind of inside of the web page on the client side. And so we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of got the pieces that we need to create, you know, pretty much anything we can think of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's keep going with that. So the next step I think we'll do is we will add a database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at FastApp, you can see it's got a lot of different things that can be passed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And over time, we'll see what all of those do. Not in this video, but over time. But perhaps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the most interesting ones is the database. This is where we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">easily create a database. And we can pass to it some keyword arguments, which will be used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">define what that database contains. If you want just one table, which is all we need for now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want more than one table, then you can actually pass in a dictionary of all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">tables that you want. And this is all just, like, convenience. You can also do this through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">any other mechanism you like. But it's super convenient just to do it through here. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to create a database for a to-do list. So it's going to contain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to-do title. And that's going to be a string.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's going to be a, is it done or not? And that's going to be a bool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's all we really need for now, I guess, right? So then we need to say what's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">name of this database going to be. So we'll call it todos.db. So by default, it's going to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">something called SQLite, which is an incredibly fast database engine that sits actually in a file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">directly on the same machine. So it's the lowest latency possible that you can have in using a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">database. And FastHTML by default kind of sets it up in a way that makes it, you know, pretty fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and pretty scalable. It should be quite a while before your application gets popular enough that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1787" target="_blank">00:29:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to need to expand it to something more, you know, bigger and more complex. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of big companies now are actually running their, you know, most of their stuff on top of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">SQLite. So you can take it a long way. You can use any database you like, though. But we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to use the one that's built in that's easiest. So this is now means we have a database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing then that it's going to do is it's going to also then pass back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple of additional things. The additional things that it passes back is an object containing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the actual table and an object containing the type of the things in that table. We can call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">them whatever we like. No, I don't need this anymore. So we're creating a to-do list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so to list our table, you just type the table name, followed by parentheses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, we save that and you can see it updates it. And we don't see anything yet because there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">no to-dos yet in this to-do list. So that makes sense. So maybe just for testing purposes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we should just add something here. That looks fine. So I'll save that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah yes, that reminds me. We should also give it a primary key. So let's say id equals int.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it's useful then to tell it what the primary key is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's try again. Okay, so after we add the primary key and tell it what the primary key is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see that it's now displaying a to-do. It's not displaying it in the most helpful way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">One simple thing we could do that makes it slightly nicer would be to wrap it in a list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, maybe before we refresh, we'll just add one more to-do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll go through the list and we'll create a list item with our to-do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that will now be an unordered list of items.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. Accidentally got it twice there, but that's fine. We'll fix that one up later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so we have a to-do list. Why do they look like this? Well, the FastHTML, FastApp,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is basically creating a data class for us behind the scenes. And this is how data classes get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">displayed. So we'd like to display them in a nicer way. So to say how you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">render your objects, you define a function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, like so. And so it's going to take a to-do and it's going to return something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll just return a list item with the title. So now we have to tell it what our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">render function is. So we'll say render equals render. And save.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. Oh, and now, of course, we shouldn't be creating list items for our to-dos at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We can now just say to-dos. Because it's going to auto-render them. There we go. That's better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's maybe add a check mark as well. Plus, let's see. That looks fine. Save that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, that's more like it. So none of them are done yet. So that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, what should we do next? Maybe we'll make it so we can mark them as done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or we could also delete them. That might be quite useful as well. So let's add something to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">toggle whether they're done or not. All right. So to do that, maybe we'll just put a little link</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">before it. Let's call it toggle. It's fine. Toggle equals. Okay, let's see what it's done for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So yes, we're going to have a thing called toggle. And it's going to get a new path,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which is /toggle/todoid. That all sounds pretty good. So now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I might actually put it at the start. Okay, so we'll save that. There we go. So we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2096" target="_blank">00:34:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">now got our links. Okay, and now we need to say what happens when you go to this path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way we say what happens when you go to a path is we create a handler for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this path's a bit special. It's got a part for it which we're going to be passed in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a todoid. And so you can put that in curly brackets. And what happens when we toggle that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so what we need to do is we're going to grab our todo. And a simple way to do that is just to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">use this square bracket here. Okay, that looks pretty good. todo.done equals not todo.done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And what are we going to return? Well, remember that by default, it's going to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">well, actually, what we want to do is we want to change the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">todo that this button was clicked on, this link was clicked on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a number of ways to do that. But one simple way to do it would be to grab the todoid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the list item, we can give it an id. And so basically, if you've,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">anything kind of keyword arguments you pass to these tags are going to just become attributes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to the tag. We'll see that in a moment. So then when we click toggle, what's going to happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what we're going to do is we're going to, first of all, we want to update our todos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just pass in the updated todo. So that's fine. And then we're going to return the todo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">itself. So what's going to happen to it? Well, it's going to be rendered using the render function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and placed somewhere into the browser's DOM. And where does it go? Well, by default,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it replaces the thing that clicked it. So by default, it replaced the link that says toggle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is not what we want. So to tell it instead what element it should change, we can use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">target id to say this is the id. And we just say tod. And actually, no, we should probably do what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it just said there, which is to change this to f, like so. That's better. Great. So now it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">actually got a string, todo dash something will be the id. So I'll save that. And we'll take a look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">at the -- and so you can see here now each list item has an id. And it has a tag, which is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to get toggle something in particular. And it's going to then target itself with the result. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so the result will actually change that DOM element. And actually, that doesn't work because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we did make one critical error, which is that when you add -- and I also forgot to talk about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">When you add something like this in curly brackets, it says take whatever's here and place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it into the parameter list of this function. So it's going to be passed the todo id. And as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">can see, we added it to our path. So we're going to pull it out of our path. But we also have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tell it what type it is. And we've got to tell it what type it is. And it's very important here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">because this is actually an integer. Because when we created the table, we said that's an integer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2336" target="_blank">00:38:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to make it an integer. And so now if we say toggle -- and so you can see it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fast. You know, as soon as I click, click, click, click.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, what's happening behind the scenes, if we click, you can see here it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sending a request to /toggle/3. The request is a get request. And then our server does the stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that we told it to do. And sends back the updated response. Which now has the tick in it. One thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that can make things a bit, you know, more concise is actually all of these things like update and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so forth actually return the object. So we can just actually return that. Let's save that. Make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sure it still works. It does. Great. All right. So the next thing, let's make it so we can delete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this extra one we didn't want. So that should be easy enough. We kind of know what to do now. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">let's go ahead and copy this line. We'll call this delete. Okay. It's going to call. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">interestingly, it doesn't matter. We can certainly use delete here. Or funnily enough, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2425" target="_blank">00:40:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we can actually just use slash. And instead of HX get, we can say HX delete. It's not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that one's better than the other. You know, whatever you like. And so this time our route</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is still on slash. But now it's going to call the delete method. We're going to be passing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">an ID. So we've got the ID here. So we'll go todos.delete. And then what happens? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what we actually want to happen is this whole list item to be deleted. So we've got the target ID</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">equals TID. And if we return nothing at all, then by default, Python actually returns the special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">none value. And so it's going to replace the target, which is the list item we click on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2480" target="_blank">00:41:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with none. And that'll actually cause it to be deleted. Because it's being replaced with nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is actually all one liner, which is kind of neat. So if we save,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, we also need to add our delete here. There we go. So now save. So there's our delete. Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">try getting rid of one of our deletes. And actually, while we do, let's have a look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So delete. Okay. It was close. Oh, I know why that didn't work. And that's because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">also by default, it actually changes the contents of the thing that we're returning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't want to change the contents of the list item. We actually want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2537" target="_blank">00:42:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">change the whole list item. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">these are -- there's not very many core attributes in HTMX. But one of the core</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">attributes is when you basically tell it what you want to happen with the result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the HX swap is the attribute that we use. And one of the values for it is -- so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it says the default is innerHTML. So we're going to change it to outerHTML,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which tells it to replace the entire target with nothing at all. So HX_swap equals outerHTML.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Save that. And then we'll refresh. Okay. So let's now try clicking delete again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. That worked nicely. So we've now got our toggle working and our delete working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got one key thing that we now need to add for it to be somewhat usable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2608" target="_blank">00:43:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the ability to create additional todos. So we've got our get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got our toggle. We've got our delete. So now we need a create.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So let's put this here. So what I tend to like to do is to look at the -- there's a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of places you can look. One is to look at the Pico CSS documentation, if you're using the default</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2640" target="_blank">00:44:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Pico. We've got other style approaches you can use. But there's a component section. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">can kind of see like, okay, how do I want things to look? Here's a form section. Input. Or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2654" target="_blank">00:44:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">other thing you can do is on our docs, if I go to component extensions, we can kind of have a look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see that there's a number of examples here, along with like what they actually look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like when they're rendered, which is quite convenient. So I'm going to use this group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">approach. And it's useful to look at the source of these things. Because when you do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, group, you can see it's like literally a single line of code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2688" target="_blank">00:44:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that's what -- when you look at the Pico CSS docs, it says, oh, you have to create a field</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">set and give it the role group. So in some ways, even creating this group function is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2699" target="_blank">00:44:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hardly necessary. But I think it's kind of nice to have these things directly available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So we're going to have a group with an input. And with a button. That sounds perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, we might as well just copy that. All right. So let's create a form. And that's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to contain our group. And so form generally doesn't call get, it calls post. Post generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">means I'm creating something. And now, what do we want to do with that? So again, in this case, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">target is going to be the to-do list itself. So let's give that an ID. Jeremy, I said to give it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">an ID. ID. There you go. Right. We'll put our form at the top. And maybe we'll put that in a --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, we'll put the whole thing in a card. That can be quite nice. So we'll create a card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">where the header is the form. And so you can see what a card looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll have our little header. We'll have our body. Okay. Actually, the header,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2788" target="_blank">00:46:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's a position -- so the header has to come after -- okay. We've got a card with an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">unordered list as the body. The header is going to be the form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I save that -- okay. We've now got that at the top. So that's nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll change this button to say add. And maybe this one, we're at a placeholder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's looking good. Okay. So when we post this form, we're going to need, obviously, a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2827" target="_blank">00:47:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">post. And so the way that forms work is that they actually pass their data directly, basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">as headers. And so we're going to be passed all the information we need for it to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, how do we make sure that that happens? The trick is to make sure that the names of each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">our elements are what we need. So in this case, we only really have one element, which is the input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we give this the name title, then that means that it's going to know how to create a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2865" target="_blank">00:47:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to-do with the correct title. Okay. So what we're going to do, then, is we've got this new to-do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got to add it to the database. And in doing so, it's going to return the added to-do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we go to dos.insert. That will return the newly added to-do. And where do we want to put it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to put it at the end of the list. So the list has the name to-do list. So we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2895" target="_blank">00:48:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">say that the target ID is to-do list. But we don't want to replace the to-do list with our single to-do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, we want to insert it at the end. So if you look at the hxswap documentation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not hwswap, hxswap, there is a before end. Insert the response after the last child. That's exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">what we want. Okay. So we're going to change our swap to before end. Okay. Save. Let's try that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Hello. Add. Wow. Amazing. Done. Delete. That's so cool. Wow. Okay. So I think there's just one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">more thing I want to do before we wrap up, which is that, well, actually, while we're here, why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">don't we just have a quick look again at the dev tools. We go to the network tab. Let's just see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what this looks like. What does this look like? Add. And the answer is a request to slash. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">method is post. And you'll see that it now has a payload, which is a form data that's added to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">request. And the response, as per usual, is just the actual item that we want added. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see behind the scenes, it's setting things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">hx-target. So it knows what to do with it. Okay. So after I click add, I would like to delete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the contents of this. So that's a little bit different. It's the first time we're saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that when we click this button, we want two things to happen. We want the to-do to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">inserted at the bottom. And we want the text box to be cleared out. So there's only one target.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3041" target="_blank">00:50:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the one target is the to-do list. And it's swapping to before the end. So we want to add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like a second target. You can't do that here. Instead, what we have to do is an out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">band swap. And that's where the thing we return, this post, has to return an additional piece of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">information, which is to say, change something else. So the thing we want to change is the text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">box. We want to change the input box to basically have what it originally had, which is this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So a simple way to do that is we can factor this out into a function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll call this make input. Okay. And we're not going to change it. We're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3088" target="_blank">00:51:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to leave it like that. I kind of prefer to put these things above where they're used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how my brain works. Okay. So just check this still works. Yep, still working. Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going to add another new parameter here, another new attribute here, which is hx,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3113" target="_blank">00:51:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">hx, I think it's called hx swap oob, isn't it? Yep, hx swap oob. So hx swap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3130" target="_blank">00:52:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">oob. And so when we do that, what it says is if you return this as a separate bit of HTML,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then it says to find the thing with this ID and replace it. And actually, at the moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3145" target="_blank">00:52:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't have an ID. So we should add one. And actually, if we just change this name to an ID,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">FastHTML automatically adds a name to it as well. So let's just try that out. Refresh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if we have a look at our input box, you can see here, look, it's got an ID title and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">got a name of title. So here's the trick. Rather than just returning the inserted to do, we also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">return our new input box. So we're returning two things. So if I refresh that now, we'll say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3181" target="_blank">00:53:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">clear me, please. And we'll say add. And you can see there, look, it's added it and it cleared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this out. So what does that look like in the network? Add. You'll see that the request is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just the same as it was before. And again, the payload's just like it was before. But the response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now contains two things. It contains the thing to add to the end of the to-do list. And it also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">includes our input with a placeholder and this special HX swap OOB. And so this is the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually replaces the target ID. And then this thing replaces whatever has the same ID as it has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. And so now we have a to-do list. Not the most amazing one ever. But, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we -- it's all in Python. We haven't had to write any JavaScript. We haven't had to write any CSS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not too much code. All right. I think the last thing that I want to do then is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">deploy this so that everybody can use our amazing to-do list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So currently I think the easiest way to deploy fast HTML applications is to Railway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is Railway.app. To deploy it to Railway, you install the Railway CLI, which you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3289" target="_blank">00:54:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">see their website for documentation on how to do that. And then here's our directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, yes. So there is one change you're going to have to make to have this work. Which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it uses the data subdirectory of your -- Railway uses the data subdirectory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3311" target="_blank">00:55:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of your folder for -- it's kind of where it mounts the persistent storage. Because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3317" target="_blank">00:55:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to mount a volume for us. So -- and the other thing we should probably do for production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3324" target="_blank">00:55:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is to change live to false. I'm not sure it matters too much. But we may as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't need live reloading in a production app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we should change this now to data/to-dos. And let's just make sure that still works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Looks fine. That's good. So we can now deploy this. So once you've installed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3356" target="_blank">00:55:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the Railway CLI, you type Railway login. And I've done that before. So I'm all logged in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So at this point, all I have to do is type FH for fast HTML. Railway deploy. And if you add a dash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">H, you'll get the help. So the first thing it needs is the name of your project. So I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3373" target="_blank">00:56:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to call this demo hello. And then do you want to create a mount? We do. The default's true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that should all be fine. So that's going to make sure that it stores our data for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3387" target="_blank">00:56:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And Railway's quite neat. It doesn't, like, charge you anything other than the bytes you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually store. And it only charges you for the time that people are actually using your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's only cost me a few cents a month, I find, to set all this up and test it lots and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So I'll say deploy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3406" target="_blank">00:56:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this takes -- it varies a bit. Sometimes, like, 30 seconds. Sometimes a minute or two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So that one's finished. And so it gives me a domain that I can check out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll copy that. Head back over here and paste it in. And there it is. And actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it even copied our little demo database across as well. So that's why our data's already here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And there it is. It's all working. Excellent. Okay. So I think that's everything I wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">show you for today. Obviously, it's a very kind of brief, quick start. Creating, you know, having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3462" target="_blank">00:57:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the ability to create any web application that's possible through HTTP, HTML, and JavaScript,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">CSS. It's a big territory to cover. And we only covered a fraction of it today. But hopefully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's enough to help you get started. And my suggestion is, as a next step, is to check out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3479" target="_blank">00:57:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the many FastHTML examples. Because pick one that does something that you like, pull it apart,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3486" target="_blank">00:58:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">change it, and see all the secrets in there. And over the coming weeks and months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auqrm7WFc0I&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll be creating a lot more tutorials and documentation to help you learn from.
