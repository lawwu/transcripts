You've been friendly with Elon, even though technically as a competitor. What do you think about the robo-taxi efforts that Tesla is doing? We don't compete with Tesla directly. We are not making cars, etc., right? We are building L45 autonomy. We're building a Waymo driver, which is general purpose and can be used in many settings.</p><p>They're obviously working on making Tesla self-driving too. I've just assumed it's a de facto that Elon would succeed in whatever he does. So that is not something I question. These spaces are such vast spaces. In all future scenarios, I see Tesla doing well and Waymo doing well. We've always been a deep technology company.</p><p>Waymo is a version of building an AI robot that works well. This year, we've scaled up a lot and will continue scaling up in 26. Like we mentioned with the Neolithic package, I think it's very possible that in the quote-unquote AI package, when the history is written, autonomous vehicles is like the big thing that changes everything.</p><p>Just the complete transition from manually driven to autonomous. In ways we might not predict, it might change the way we move about the world completely. Second and third order effects, as you're seeing now with Tesla, very possibly you would see internally with Alphabet, maybe Waymo, maybe some of the Gemini robotics stuff.</p><p>Because we should remember that Waymo is a robot. It just happens to be on four wheels. You said that the next big thing might be in the space of robotics. Demis and the Google DeepMine team is very focused on Gemini robotics, right? So we are definitely building the underlying models.</p><p>So we have a lot of investments there. And I think we are also pretty cutting edge in our research there. So we are definitely driving that direction. We obviously are thinking about applications. We are partnering with a few companies today, but it's an area I would say stay tuned.</p><p>We are yet to fully articulate our plans outside, but it's an area we are definitely committed to driving a lot of progress. But I think AI ends up driving that massive progress in robotics. The field has been held back. I mean, hardware has made extraordinary progress. The software had been the challenge, but you know, with AI now and the generalized models we are building, getting them to work in the real world in a safe way, in a generalized way is the frontier we're pushing pretty hard on.</p><p>Transcription by ESO.
