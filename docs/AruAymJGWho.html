and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">scaling up test time compute papers

another minute some people are needing passcodes they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">just not using the right link but okay once we hit 50 we should be good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">okay we've got a new link posted and then we're good to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah um can you see the screen yep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">uh okay so the today uh i want to cover a two paper but both of them are about the test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">time scaling and the latest uh hot topic the idea is that we want to build lm which uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so we want to increase the performance so we know from latest models like openai gemini</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and tropic already that reasoning works the uh the thinking works so uh idea is to we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">want to replicate that work and this paper from stanford is trying to replicate the reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">step with uh like um only 200 or something like that so only a small budget the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is that uh so uh they collected 1k samples uh in some way i'll take uh i'll take a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and uh yeah idea is that they train qn 0.5 uh 32b and it outperforms or one preview actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on the mass and reasoning data sets that's the idea and um they uh they created some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of technique which is pretty simple i think and yeah mostly it's for the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like me who don't have a lot of budget and resources to train the model and still have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ability to train reasoning elements so uh yeah objective is to to create a simple simplest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">approach to achieve this time scaling actually so uh to deep dive into the methodology um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">let me scroll a bit um yeah the first thing is that they somehow created uh 1000 examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and uh what they did actually to took some mass data sets like numina mass uh aj ibel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on and they generated uh tracing reasoning tracing using gemini 2.2 flash thinking and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they did some uh pipeline after that so first is that uh they collected uh almost like 60k</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">examples then they filtered using the quality which means to drop some examples based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the formatting some uh ascii errors as i remember and uh yeah after that they got 54k uh and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah then they filter uh based on the difficulty and what they did is that took two model like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm not sure if you can see the image perfectly but they took uh two image qn.57b and 32b</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and they asked the question on both models and if any of the model uh responds correctly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they just filter those examples so they the idea is that they want to choose the hardest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">question that none of the model can answer and they evaluate the the correctness using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the claw 3.5 sonnet and after that they got uh 25k uh samples uh and also they uh took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the the length of the reasoning so uh reasoning trace so you can say that if the the length</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is the peak maybe it's a more like challenging problem or something like that after that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">uh the the key point is to take some so since the idea is do we want to uh run and train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the model and uh small uh samples they have to take some uh sampling right so they took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">uh some llm and cluster those examples of 25k and after that took some uh just do some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sampling to collect 1k examples and uh took them based on the reasoning trace length actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so yeah after those pipelines they collected 1k examples okay data sets which replace like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the question the reasoning and the answers uh so if there are any questions about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I can stop a few seconds and I can continue because it's important to understand that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's simplest approach I mean but yeah it's pretty good to collect and uh yeah take some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">data okay uh after that they trained a qn 2.5 stemming to b and yeah as you can uh imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they got some good results so yeah another thing that we uh that I want to explain before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I show the result is that uh after creating data set they um create uh some technique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">uh to increase the test time scaling so the name is budget forcing or something like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as I remember and the idea is that if you want to generate more tokens and more thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">steps you add the word wait in the output and model understand to continue the generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you want to stop the thinking process and for the generation you add the final answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that those words in the generation and it stops the um the process yeah that the budget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">forcing here so they have the maximum number of tokens the minimum number of tokens and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the ability to control the length of the traces based on those simple words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the idea uh yes okay and about about the results that first thing is that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it outperforms or one preview and we also it's comparable to everyone this deal from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">deep seek qn reasoning and also the sky sky one t which is a few weeks ago um yeah also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting thing that we can see um is that uh if you increase it uh the thinking time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so the if you generate more tokens the performance increased for some uh data set like mess time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and qa uh okay yeah that's the example if you want to see how it works so let's say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how many are in the raspberry uh and as you can see it got the the wrong answer and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">add the word weight which

target="_blank">00:10:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah return the correct answer okay um yeah another uh good thing is that uh as you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">see after some time the results uh converge so if you generate a lot of tokens or if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">add a lot of weight awards in the generation after some time it converts that's another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">uh result and also they compare those methods for other uh methods like majority voting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or other else and found that the scaling law for the test times for those uh techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">are different so as you can see uh for um for this budget forcing uh results goes up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but for majority voting yeah a little bit um yeah yeah that's also an interesting results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so as you can see this is a their model the final one and they compare the results for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">openai gemini and qn uh and other open weights and open data models also as we mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that the data the model all of these are open source so you can check it uh yeah and test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then data as well okay so yeah as you can see it outperforms for uh or one preview</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on math data set and for amy and not for pqa and the same results for all mini uh for gemini</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we only have one results uh for other tool that i remember they can't test it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">gemini blocks some uh blocks some uh api requests and for amy this is only 30 or 40 examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so they test it manually in a google ai studio and that's why we have only those results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's nearly comparable to the gemini and the idea is that they kind of a distill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">uh gemini right and uh with only 1000 example they got comparable results to gemini actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">another interesting thing is that uh this is the base model that they took uh and yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the gain of the performance is a lot so like 30 uh for me and so on which is a huge yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and uh some results from uh deepsec is comparable as well but the idea that they mentioned is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that uh in date in uh in those case they only took 1000 examples so for deepsec they distill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">uh 800k examples to to train their models okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">okay after that they do they did some ablations uh and uh found some good interesting things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">i think uh so uh first one is that um how you choose uh 1000 examples from 60k and yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they choose like from for example from random from the diverse like based on the clusters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to cut the 1k based on the lengths of the traces and just train on the full data set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and as you can see it outperforms all 1k examples but it's comparable and yeah full data outperforms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit but the idea is that we only use 1k examples rather than the 60k and got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that mostly the same results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">uh yeah i found that last section pretty interesting basically uh they these results show that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if they didn't go through their like four step approach of filtering to a thousand samples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">their results are 40 30% worse right so their whole thing of like step one see if the questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are easy step two cluster and take like diverse samples that alone to like get the thousand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">high quality versus just a thousand random samples 30% net difference so pretty big importance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in their little filtration pipeline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah exactly so the pipeline is pretty simple i think but maybe one of the good thing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to filter based on the the quality and uh based on the model response i think rather</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">than that like the formatting i think doesn't matter actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah the model response if i'm not mistaken from the two base plan models was basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just throwing out a lot of it so like when they use the quen 7b and quen 32b the base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">models basically what they did was they ran their 60 000 questions through these if the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">two basic models could answer it correctly then we just throw out the sample it's too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">easy so step one you know that filters a good bit just to get hard questions but yeah high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">level their whole pipeline was pretty interesting um yeah that seems to be like half of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">value so yeah a lot of it was just yeah there's good at 1000 samples the other one was kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of the budget forcing right so you want to i think explain a bit more about how the budget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">forcing is working and what it's doing i thought it was pretty unique yeah just to summarize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">those are the important things so data sampling those data pipeline and budget forcing actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for the data uh side actually i test this idea for my use cases not for the uh the reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">uh thing but uh i collect and i mix the data set based on this technique and yeah it really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">works because you can choose the high quality data based on that and yeah about the body</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">budget forcing um as i mentioned so you can uh you have ability to control the size of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the reasoning so let's say you have the minimum number of token that you want to generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and maximum number of token that you want to generate right and you can control this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">uh the length based on the wording so if you want to generate more you add wording like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">weight like as you can see here and model uh continue the generation and generate more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens and you can do that several times like two or three times if you want to generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">more and if you want to stop the generation you can add the final answer word and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">total generation so you can control the maximum number of tokens based on that yeah that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea i'm not sure if any other work is uh doing something like that um but yeah so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">after this came out some other people started doing it essentially what people are also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">saying is it's a way some people are saying this is the distinction between o3 mini low</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and o3 mini high and it allows you to control how much thinking you do right so as we generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens autoregressively eventually we generate an end of sentence token end of text token</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we stop generation so what they're doing is anytime the model the next likely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">token is the end of token end

| <span class="t">so hmm what should i do and like it continues thinking and now at inference time you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of just force more thinking or if it's rambling too much you can you know force it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to end once it's given an answer if

<span class="t">like final answer and start boxing your answer but the the interesting thing here is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah it also played quite in effect so they show their scores of um with and without budget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">forcing but it's essentially like a inference time hack to control the amount of thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right so if you think of like as an api consumer if i want thinking to be like 30 maybe i add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:25:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens like how does that compare because it's a little bit apples to oranges to compare to</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:25:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">said we distilled the big ones here you go they're good here's how they perform but like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

they did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for distillation except for i

target="_blank">00:26:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's a little different too because like this is trained on um outputs from gemini that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">be on outputs of r1 so like there's a little stuff different but directly to your question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">deep seek

target="_blank">00:26:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">fact check or make a note i don't think the deep seek paper paper said how many samples are used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

anyone figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is that the same is

target="_blank">00:27:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">so um two two things one is i think what they're going after here is sample efficiency right so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they want to show how you can do it in a couple thousand samples and two i think we can look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the um r1 distill so apparently r1 distill is better according to my quick let's ask chachi pt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but it could have hallucinated so yeah i just i just do it it's like r1 distill is better i don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">trust okay so it looks like um they did give numbers i remember this so they used um 600,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sft also thanks um leah for pointing this out so for the r1 the original deep seek paper they used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">800,000 samples 600,000 sft plus 200,000 reasoning traces and i think they actually yeah they do put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it in the paper here so uh it performed they have benchmarks of r1 distill right there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's the third row

target="_blank">00:28:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">technical distillation was different right so that is the largest yeah totally not like totally get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">uh like this is it's going after something different just one it's an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">comparison but i guess i yeah so that distill presumably is that 32b quinn yes it is uh 800,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1725"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea is that most of the model that we already know generates the reasoning and thinking tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in the output right and in that paper they create the architecture which doesn't produce explicitly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens in the generation so with things and reason in the architecture itself that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">main difference so now why do we need that kind of model because uh if you want to generate like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">as you can see the latest models like generate thousand tokens in their thinking and reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so it takes a lot of time also you need to have a big context window and which doesn't work for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">small models and also as i mentioned there are some reasoning abstractions that you can explicitly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">say by words so you need to have some high dimensional latent space where the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">resonating itself in the architecture yeah that's the idea and about the methodology so they create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the architecture so they add some recurrent block in the transformers and the idea is that when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">train the model you run several ties in the loop so as i remember they took random numbers so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes you run three times maybe five times and so on and yeah that's the most of the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so they took a 3.5 b model and they train on 800 billion tokens and as i mentioned it is equivalent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like 50 billion parameter models so the result is pretty impressive as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah and as you can see the result in the first case as you run the loops in the test time so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">performance increase and for some benchmarks it converts quickly but for gsm8k it has a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">improvements actually okay um yeah so uh why why they train the models as i mentioned that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't you don't in this case you don't need to have uh the specialized data for the for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">training uh also this technique uh takes less memory memory so idea is that you use a small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">model but more compute to increase the performance and yeah as i mentioned it takes more flops</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's more efficient since you have small models you don't need to have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah that's the architecture uh yeah there are some uh sections uh the the topics why they use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the embeddings and uh yeah some uh some improvements in the efficiency because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they train this model on amd hardware uh with specialized gpus as i remember and as i mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they uh needed to create some kind of tricks and uh to make some uh fast training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">uh yeah so and as the previous paper also they published their pre-training codes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and uh the model and the data okay so uh what they did actually that uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">since they have they don't have a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">model on mass and reasoning tasks so most of the data comes from the holding and

mixing strategy maybe is not the best but the idea is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just to test if this module architecture works so um yeah um and they did some uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they published the parameters hyperparameters uh they did some packing and so on one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">problem that they have in the training was to uh since it's a different architecture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they mentioned that hyperparameters and the setup uh matters actually so in the first run this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the the orange they don't have a good performance but after some tweaking like learning rate and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2055" target="_blank">00:34:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">some hyperparameters they get some good results the blue one which is the latest the main model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and yeah loss goes down um and yeah they uh i'm not sure about the the number of loops</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but yeah maybe we'll see in the results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and yeah so when i see the results it doesn't look uh very good rather than the previous paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but we can see some uh some improvements in the in the for loop i think so yeah if you check</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the results it's uh it doesn't outperform most of the models actually so they compare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the old models and pythea which is pretty old i think already uh and yeah the result is uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not so good but uh the main main thing is that performance increase if you include the loop as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">well uh but yeah as you can see 49 and 69 for arc easy um yeah and uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2127" target="_blank">00:35:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah they test on gsm rate k</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and yeah also one thing is that they check if uh if this architecture um emerged some ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like for example a chain of thought and some skills that we know for the other lens right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so they test those ideas and see that this architecture works also for uh with the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so if you give some for example few short examples it improves the performance so just to test the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">idea that it doesn't goes wrong for for other ability uh yeah they publish some early checkpoints</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">as well and uh yeah as you can see performance goes up uh there was yeah also they compare the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">baseline so baseline needs to take the same data set uh and run just uh with the base training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">technique and without those architecture and uh yeah as you can see performance uh is much better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as well so for example 46 and 69 i think this is a good result uh because we know that with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2217" target="_blank">00:36:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">same data set with the um same compute let's say you get much better performance and also they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2227" target="_blank">00:37:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">compare with r equals one and yeah actually it's the less performance than the baseline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that's another uh interesting thing as well yeah they uh checked a few short examples and as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can see if you use the zero shot it converged quickly but if you use uh more shots yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">performance goes up which is good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah so in this case they uh check that uh model uh uh needs more uh loops in the architecture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">uh when the problem is complex let's say so it's like uh for example high school mathematics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">needs uh five loops but uh logical or moral scenarios need much more let's say 20 or 25</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2284" target="_blank">00:38:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">uh yeah some of the inference time loops are kind of interesting so rj asked about the recurrent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">backprop so they have this little section here in chapter four on recur uh truncated backdrop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">backprop where i think they truncate everything except for like the last eight or something and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then so what that allows is you can still have somewhat efficient training but at inference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">time you know the thing can still like roll out its internal thought for as long as it wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2321" target="_blank">00:38:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but they they have a little section somewhere i think it's in chapter section four on truncated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AruAymJGWho&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">backdrop but um
