It's not a coincidence or an accident that it's named in the First Amendment to the Constitution. Without it, no democratic society can be democratic for long. And I'm an absolutist. That is, I believe that, for example, people say to me, but what about hate speech? Well, hate speech is much more important than love speech. And the reason is I'm much more interested in knowing whom I should not turn my back on than I am interested in figuring out who loves me. The following is a conversation with Harvey Silverglate, a legendary free speech advocate, co-founder of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, and the author of several books on the freedom of speech and criminal justice, including The Shadow Universe. The betrayal of liberty on America's campuses. Harvey is running to be on the Harvard Board of Overseers this year with a write-in campaign. So you have to spell his name correctly. Silverglate. Promising to advocate for free speech and to push for reducing the size of Harvard's administration bureaucracy. Election is over this Tuesday, May 16th at 5 p.m. Eastern. To vote, you have to be Harvard alumni. So if you happen to be one. Please vote online. It's a good way to support freedom of speech on Harvard campus. Instructions how to do so are in the description. As a side note, please allow me to say that since there are several controversial conversations coming up, I tried to make sure that this podcast is a platform for free discourse where ideas are not censored but explored. And if necessary, challenged in a thoughtful and pathetic way. It's by having such difficult conversations. Not by avoiding. That we can begin to heal divides and to shed light on the dark parts of human history and human nature. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Harvey Silverglate. You co-founded the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as FIRE. A legendary organization that fights for the freedom of speech for all Americans in our courtrooms, on our campuses. And in our culture. So let's start with a big question. What is freedom of speech? First of all, the organization, when I co-founded it in 1999, was called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. It focused on free speech issues on college campuses in academia. And only earlier this year did we decide to expand our region. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time.

And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. - So you don't think that hate speech can empower large groups that eventually lead to physical action, that eventually lead to physical action, that eventually lead to physical action, to physical harm to others? - No, I don't. I think that we have developed a culture in which it's understood that if you don't like in which it's understood that if you don't like what you hear, you talk back. You write something. You write something. We don't punch each other. We insult each other. It's insulting, great. Well, I don't know, it's okay. I used to, as a kid in Brooklyn, I used to, as a kid in Brooklyn, where I was born, I was born and raised in Bensonhurst, where I was born, I was born and raised in Bensonhurst, we used to say, "Sticks and stones can break my bones, but names can never harm me." And it's absolutely true. What was true when I was five is true when I'm almost 81. what was true when I was five is true when I'm almost 81. So I've lived a long time. I've seen it all. And I'm talking from experience as well as theory. It's what happens when you get in a fight and you reach your 80s. I read that you had this line that you cannot be protected from being called an asshole. Correct. Especially if you're an asshole. Well, that's... But you don't have to be an asshole to be called an asshole. That's correct. And I think the internet has taught me that. Well, the internet has posed a particular challenge to free speech absolutists because some of the stuff that's on there is god-awful. But I have no different rules for freedom of speech on the internet than I have in newspapers or in lectures or in classrooms or conversations among people. What do you think about the tension between freedom of speech and freedom of reach as it's sometimes termed? So the internet really challenges that aspect. It allows speech to become viral and spread very quickly to a very large number of people. Well, you know, we've had revolutions in the modalities of communication. After all, newspapers were the first challenge. Radio and television posed a new challenge. The FCC tried, but ultimately gave up the attempt to control obscenity, for example. And the Supreme Court has been pretty close. The one thing that liberal and conservative Supreme Courts, right now we're in a conservative era due to Trump nominations. During much of my life the Warren Court, it was William O. Douglas, Brennan, the liberal court, one thing they agree on is free speech. They don't agree on much else. But they do agree on free speech, and I think the reason is that they recognize that, well, my group is in the ascendance today, but it may not be tomorrow, and I want to have objective, clear rules so that when I'm in the minority I'm able to voice my opinion. And so, it's one of the few things that both sides of the political spectrum agree on. The only people who don't are the people way over on the right that I call the fascists and the people way over on the left who are the communists. But with respect to most people in this, on the political spectrum, Republicans, Democrats, Socialists, Libertarians, they agree on the primacy of free speech because it protects them when protection is needed. So to you, even on the internet, free speech absolutism should rule? Yes. Nobody's gonna die. Remember, death threats are not protected. Nobody's gonna die. So people are gonna be a little bit insulted. That's the price you pay for living in a free society. And it's a small price in my view. Some people don't have as tough a hide as others. Well, then develop it. I don't mean to sound cruel, but you're living in a free society. Develop a tough hide. So that's the cost of living in a free society. Yep. There's a cost. The thing is that it can really hurt at scale to be cyber-bullied, to be attacked for the ideas you express or maybe ideas you didn't express but that somebody decided to lie about you and use that to attack you. Well, first of all, there are some exceptions to the First Amendment. Libel and slander is an exception. Direct threats are an exception. If you say such and such, I will murder you. That is not lawful. If you say about somebody, "Oh, you know, you beat your wife," that is not lawful if in fact the person knows you don't beat your wife. There are some limits. Defamation is one. Direct threats are another. And so it's not absolute. The First Amendment is not absolute. But it's more absolute than it is in any other society and it's pretty near absolute. For example, fraud. If you sell somebody a car and you say, "Oh, this is in great running shape and in fact it's an old jalopy and it's not going to make it more than 10 miles," that's fraud. That's not free speech. So free speech is not absolute. There are these limits. But they're very narrow, specific categories of limits. But there's gray area here because while legally you're not allowed to defame a person, in the court of public opinion, especially with the aid of anonymity on the internet, rumors can spread at scale. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people can make up things about you. You have to defend yourself. Using more speech. We're big, we're through freedom of speech. We're big boys and girls. You have to defend yourself. You know, in some societies if you say something, if you, right now, if you say something nasty about Putin, you'll end up in the gulag. If you say something nasty about Biden, you end up in the New York Times. Where would you rather be? Well, let's talk about the thing you've done for over 20 years, which is fight for the freedom of speech on college campuses. So why is freedom of speech important on college campuses? Well, it's important everywhere in the society, but it's most important on college campuses. Why? Because that's where we educate our young citizens. And if you are educated under a notion that some dean can call you on the carpet, because you say something which is considered racist, or you can say something which is considered dangerous to social cohesion, then it's not a liberal arts college. Now, the theory that I used in the Shadow University A book you've written, The Shadow University. 1998. You were ahead of a lot of these things, by the way. I'm afraid that as a pessimist, I always saw the bad side of things. The portrayal of liberty on America's campuses, the Shadow University, a book you co-authored with Alan Charles. Yes, with one of my Princeton classmates, Alan Charles Kors, who's now an emeritus professor of Enlightenment history at the University of Pennsylvania. I only taught for one semester, and I can go into that later, the other reason that I did not continue to teach in colleges. It was Harvard Law School. I taught a course in the mid-1980s. But in any event, the college campuses are one of the most important for free speech. This is where people get education. And if you don't really get a good education, if certain points of view are not allowed to be expressed, because education comes from the clash of ideas, and you then have to decide, this is how you become a thinking adult. You have to decide which ideas make more sense to you, which ones you're going to follow, the college experience is transformative. And if there is censorship on campuses, it's highly destructive of the educational enterprise, and ultimately to the entire society. You know, we have in the sciences, we have a scientific method. Scientific method is, you try experiments, and you see which ones work, and then you develop theories based upon the results of experiments. Well, this is not much different from every other aspect of life. You have to entertain different views on different subjects. You hear all the views, and you make a decision as to which one's accurate and which one's not. So the scientific method I apply to non-science, to history, to journalism, to all of these things. So that scientific method includes ideas, hateful ideas, all sorts of things. Correct. If you don't allow hateful ideas, I mean, when scientists do experiments, nobody says to them, "Oh, you know, don't do that experiment, because it would be very bad if that turns out to be accurate, that outcome." That's not the way it works. Every point of view is thrown into the marketplace, whether it's science or whether it's non-science. And that includes the kind of ideas and the kind of discourse that might actually lead to an increase in hate on campuses. The First Amendment prohibits speech which is liable to produce imminent imminent violence. So, for example, you know, the exception is yelling falsely, falsely yelling fire in a crowded movie theater. A lot of people misstate it. They say, "Oh, the exception is yelling fire in a movie theater." Well, if there's really a fire, you're performing a real important function by yelling fire. But it's falsely yelling fire. You could start a riot, people would be crushed trying to get out. So there are these, that's one of the exceptions of the First Amendment as the Supreme Court has defined it. There are very few exceptions. And defamation is an exception. I'm not a fan of that exception, frankly. But if you say something about somebody that has serious implications in their life, in their ability to earn a living, if you say, accuse somebody of being a pedophile when it's not true, that person can sue you. My own view is I think that's an unfortunate exception, but I'm not on the Supreme Court. I think that I'm with, a friend of mine was Nat Hentoff. Nat Hentoff who wrote for decades for the Village Voice in New York. He was a friend of mine. He was a free speech absolutist. And he wrote a fabulous book called Free Speech for Me, But Not for Thee. And he was an absolutist and I'm with Nat Hentoff. Even on the defamation aspect. I mean, I agree with you in some sense. Just practically speaking, it seems like that the way, the best way in the public sphere to defend against defamation is with more speech. Correct. And through authenticity, through authentic communication of the truth as you see it. Yeah. You know, at times the Boston Globe has said something about me that hasn't been accurate. They have invariably published my letter to the editor. I'm also not bashful about getting in touch with the reporter. At the end of every column they give the reporter's email address. And I know people say that I have more access to the media than most people. But all that means is I get the fame more than most people. Can we also comment on, from the individual consumer of speech, there's a kind of sense that freedom of speech means you should be forced to read all of it. Freedom of speech versus freedom of reach. We as consumers of speech, do we have the right to select what we read? We do. And nobody can force us to sit in a room and listen to a radio program that we don't want to listen to. Nobody can force us to read a book that we don't want to read. The whole notion of freedom of speech means that people have autonomy. On their choices. In order to form a complete mind, a complete human being, there's a kind of tension of that autonomy versus consuming as many varied perspectives as possible, which is underlying the ethic of free speech. So on college campuses it seems like a good way to develop the mind is to get as many perspectives as possible, even if you don't really want to. Well that's, that is the theory. Academic freedom is supposed to be the highest degree of free speech. You should be able to entertain all kinds of hateful, threatening ideas, and the way I put it is, there's something wrong when you can say something with complete abandon without any fear in Harvard Square, whereas on the other side of the fence, you can't say it in Harvard Yard. It should be the opposite. And what happens is universities, from the best to the worst, from the most famous to the least well known, have been taken over by administrators. Administrators do not really subsume academic values. They know nothing about the constitution, they know nothing about free speech, they know nothing about academic freedom. They feel that their job is to keep order. And so they develop speech codes, kangaroo courts to enforce the speech codes, and these are very dire developments. I wrote about them in the shadow university in '98, and tried to deal with them in 1999 when I started FIRE. Code started FIRE. And I would FIRE, the reason I'm running currently for the Harvard Board of Overseers is, what I'd like to do is convince the Harvard Corporation the so-called president and fellows of Harvard College, the chief governing board of the university with the real power, the Board of Overseers is a secondary body, but quite influential, to FIRE 95% of the administrators. It would have a salutary effect on the academics of the university, it would have a salutary effect on free speech and academic freedom, it would cut tuitions by about 40%, and it would create a whole different atmosphere on the campus. And the same could be said of MIT or any other place. I think administrators are a very bad influence on American higher education. - Can you sort of elaborate the intuition why this thing that you call administrative bloat is such a bad thing for a university? - Well, first of all, just in terms of the cost of maintaining, there are more administrators in American higher education than there are faculty members. The cost is enormous. Number two, they are inimical to the teaching enterprise and they feel that their job is to control things, to make sure there are no problems and nobody's feelings are hurt. Being called, you know, before a dean because you said something that insulted somebody is something that shouldn't happen in American higher education, yet it happens because you have these administrators who think it's their job to protect people from being insulted. You insult a black student, you insult a woman, there's a disciplinary hearing. Well, there shouldn't be. Black people are accustomed to being insulted. Jews are accustomed to being insulted. Women are accustomed to being insulted. And it's very good to know who doesn't like you. It's useful. It is essential information to know who doesn't like you. If everybody is forced to say I love you and nobody can say I hate you, you get a false view of what life is all about. - Outside of the university. - Outside of the university. You do graduate eventually. - And that's ultimately the mission of the university is to prepare you to make you into a great human being, into a great leader that can take on the problems of the world. - Correct. And you don't do it by treating you like a little flower. - But what role does the university have to protect students? To women, African Americans, anybody, Jews, anybody who can be a victim of hate speech? - They protect you from physical assault. If somebody physically assaults you, then they get punished. But they shouldn't protect you against insult because that is a violation of academic freedom. The freedom of the insulter to insult you. And also, as I said, it's very useful to know who doesn't like you. It's useful for the so-called victim. I think it's essential. I want to know who doesn't like me. It's as important to me as knowing who likes me. - But do you also believe in this open space of discourse, that the insulter will eventually lose? - I think that's true. I think that the insulter eventually will wear out his or her welcome. I do. But I like to know who the insult is. - Because it gives you a deeper understanding of human nature. - Yeah. And usually, by the way, my experience has been that the insulters have generally not been as smart as the people they've insulted. And that's probably one of the reasons they insult them, because they feel inferior. I mean, I'm not trying to be a psychoanalyst here, but a lot of the people who are the haters are pretty low down on the intellectual scale. - Anyway, 95% of administration, you would fire your calling to fire 95% of the administration. People should know, I think people that don't really think about the structure, the way the universities work, are not familiar, I think, with the fact that administration, there's a huge bloat of administration. When you think about what makes a great university, it's about the students, it's about the faculty, it's about the people that do research, if it's a research university. They don't think about the bureaucracy of meetings and committees and rules and paperwork and all that, and all the people that are involved with pushing that kind of paper. And there's a huge cost to that, but it also slows down and suppresses the beautiful variety that makes a university great, which is the teaching, the student life, the protests, the clubs, all the fun that you can have in a university, all the varied kind of exploration, which you can't really do once you graduate. - Correct. - It's the place, the university is a place to really explore. In every single way. So let me just talk about this important thing, because I'm very fortunate to have contacted you almost by accident in a very important moment in your life. You're running for the Harvard Board of Overseers. What is this board, how much power does it have, and what would you do if elected? - Okay. First of all, I have a prediction. - Yes. - That in about five years, they're gonna probably change the name because "Overseers" reminds people of the slavery era, and we're in such a politically correct era now that the English language is being restricted, corrupted is the way I put it, because certain words are forbidden. We have some problems in this country, and I think part of the problem is the educational system has lost the sense of what academic freedom and free speech are all about, and I think it's essential that the educational system begin to take more seriously what free speech and academic freedom really are. That's why I'm running for the Harvard Board of Overseers. - So let me just link on the role of the administration in protecting free speech. So what often happens, I think you've written about this, is there's going to be a few, maybe a small number of hypersensitive students and faculty that protest. So how does Harvard administration resist the influence of those hypersensitive protesters in protecting speech, in protecting even hate speech? - Harvard has done fairly well under the presidency of Lawrence Bacow. I have had a couple of meetings with Bacow. I like Bacow. I have donated to Harvard a print of my late wife, took a picture of Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg when the Rolling Thunder Review got to Harvard Square, and it's sort of an iconic photograph. She's called it the music lesson because it's got Dylan teaching Ginsberg how to play the guitar. And I donated one of those to Harvard. It's hanging in Bacow's office. He, the new president, Claudine Gay, is not known for respecting academic freedom and free speech. People have said to me, well give her a chance. Well, I'm willing to give her a chance, but she does have a record. And she's a bureaucrat. I don't think she believes in free speech and academic freedom. I think she's a progressive, not a liberal. I'm not happy with the appointment of Claudine Gay. And it has made more essential my attempt to get on the Board of Overseers. - So let's talk about the Board of Overseers and your run for it. The specifics, actually. It would be nice because I think you're a write-in candidate and the election is over on May 16th? - Yes. - And I think there are specifics. I'll probably give them in the intro. I'll give links to people. But the specifics are complicated. Let me just mention that you have to be Harvard alumni. So I've graduated from Harvard. - You have to, in order to run and in order to vote. - In order to vote. And the process, I imagine, is not trivial, but this is done online. And if you're an alumni, you should have received an email from a particular email address: harvard@mgelectionservicescorp.com And presumably there's a way to get some validation number from that email. And then you go online, you enter that validation number, and you vote. And to vote for Harvey, you have to enter his name correctly: Harvey Silverglate. And spell it correctly. Obviously, I'm imagining this, because I'm imagining MIT, not Harvard. So I'm imagining the process is not trivial. You have to click on things, you have to sort of follow instructions that are not trivial. And I'll also provide an email if the process is painful, it doesn't work for you, that you can email. Email harvard and complain. IT help at harvard.edu and so on. I'll provide all the links. But is there something else you can say about the voting process, what you're running on, what you're doing? This is my second run. The first time I got enough signatures to get on the ballot. Then the Harvard Alumni Association sent out a letter to all living Harvard alums recommending that they vote for the officially nominated candidates. That excluded two petition candidates of whom I was one. And I wrote to the Alumni Association and I said, "You have now sent out the curricula vitaes and the policy positions of all the officially nominated candidates. There are two petition candidates on the ballot. I would like to be able to send out my positions to the voters." They wrote me back saying, "Our policy is to only send out the policy positions and the platforms of officially nominated candidates. Can you believe that?" Well, this is a liberal arts college, right? Where from the clash of ideas truth emerges. Well, really? This is what I call Harvard's not so subtle means of candidate suppression. Not voter suppression, candidate suppression. And everybody can vote, but not everybody can run. It ill becomes a liberal arts college where the clash of ideas will produce the truth. What about the clash of ideas of the Board of Overseers? The Board of Overseers is important. It doesn't have the same power and authority as the Harvard Corporation, the so-called President and Fellows of Harvard College. But it's very influential and very important and it would be a great perch for me to try to exert influence for the university to get back to where it was before it was taken over by the administrators. Well, I'm pretty sure that most of Harvard alumni, most of the students currently going to Harvard, most of the faculty at Harvard probably stand behind the ideas and the ideals that you stand behind. Yep. The people that love Harvard and what it stands for. See, the alumni were educated in an era when these concepts were taken more seriously and before the administration, the administrators took over. So I do think if I get my message out, I'm going to win the seat. And if I win a seat, I will have a great perch for trying to convince the real power that be, which is the Harvard Corporation, to do the things that I'm suggesting. You know, get rid of 95% of the administrators, get rid of their speech codes, reduce tuition by 40%, all of these salutary benefits. Can you imagine if Harvard became the most affordable college in the United States? Well, the affordability is another aspect, but I think before that, just the freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of thought, at America's greatest universities, I think is something that everybody would agree on. It would have a tremendous effect on the whole country. And is there something to say about the details of how difficult it is for alumni to vote? Well, you could vote online, or you can vote by paper ballot, you could request a paper ballot. And all I could say is that the hard part is getting the message out. My name doesn't appear on the ballot because I couldn't get enough signatures. Well, Harvey, Harvey, he's a great guy. Harvey Silverglate. S-I-L-V-E-R-G-L-A-T. You know, when my grandparents arrived from Russia, the name in Russian was something like Zilbaglate. And the immigration officer had several choices. He could have said Silvergate. Gate is a real, silver and gate are real English words. He could have said Silverglade, G-L-A-D-E. Those are real English words. That's how my name is often spelled, either Silvergate or Silverglade. Silverglate is a nonsense syllable. And why the immigration officer chose to transliterate Zilbaglate as Silverglade, I'll never understand. And it is the cause of endless mistakes in my name. Well, the fundamental absurdity of life is also the source of its beauty. Yes. Anyway, we shall spell it out and we shall get yell loud and wide that everybody who has ever graduated from Harvard should vote for you if they believe in the ideals of the great American universities, which I think most people do. Let me also ask about diversity, inclusion, and equity programs. You've been, you've had a few harsh words to say about those. You know, the idea of diversity I think is a beautiful idea. You said that Harvard's idea of diversity is for everyone to look different and think alike. Correct. Can you elaborate? And be comfortable. And be comfortable. Yeah. First of all, it is impossible if liberal arts education is taken seriously, it's impossible for students to feel comfortable. Why? Because one of the roles of college is to challenge all the beliefs that they grew up with, which mostly are the beliefs inculcated by parents and by elementary school teachers. And the idea is to be able to challenge those thoughts, those ideas. And if you don't have free speech and academic freedom, those views get reified, they do not get challenged. So it is, it violates the fundamental role of higher educational institutions to have any restrictions at all. That's number one. Number two, as I think I said earlier, if people, students are not allowed to be frank with one another, they don't really learn about one another. And you know, I've given a lot of lectures in which I have said, and I think students now understand it, I'm much more interested in hearing from the people who hate me than the people who love me. I'm much more interested in knowing who disagrees with me than people who agree with me. That's how I learn, and that's how they learn, the clash of ideas, which is the theory behind the First Amendment. That truth will somehow emerge, or if not truth, at least a better truth, a truer truth, a more useful truth, if ideas are allowed to clash. Especially in the structure of a university where at least I would say there's some set of rules, some set of civility. I think I would rather read Mein Kampf to understand people that hate. There is also a quality to disagreement that we should strive for, and I think a university is a place where when disagreement and even hate is allowed, it's done in a high effort way. You know, somebody asked me once about what books I would, what I have as required reading in literature courses, and I listed Mein Kampf. And they were horrified. And I said, "Well, it's one of the most important books of the 20th century." Six million Jews died, an enormous number of other people died, because one guy wrote a book called Mein Kampf and took it seriously. It's one of the most important books ever written. How can an educated person not have at least breezed through Mein Kampf? And... It's not a great read, though. He was not a great writer. But you do get a sense for the sociopath that was Adolf Hitler. Yes. Because he really acted on the words that he wrote. Yeah. And it was there, and if people took that work seriously, Correct. they would have understood. It's one of the most important books of the 20th century. And it's politically incorrect to read it. It's crazy. But can you speak to the um... the efforts to increase diversity in universities, which I think is embodied in this D.I.E. effort of diversity, inclusion, and equity programs. Where do they go right? Where do they go wrong? Okay, let me tell you, first of all, this may surprise a lot of people. I am opposed to affirmative action. Um... And I think that what it does is it... labels people by their race, by their religion, and by their national origin. Precisely what we don't want people to do is be pigeonholed in those categories. The reason that affirmative action has become the way that universities decide on who gets admitted is because historically people in what's called marginalized groups blacks, gays, Hispanics have been discriminated against in the admissions process. Now, what I have suggested is that instead of affirmative action, and by the way, here's a prediction. The Supreme Court is going to abolish affirmative action. There's a case pending, a Harvard case. Um... It's... There are two cases joined together, one of a public university and one of a private university. The private university is Harvard. I predict that the Supreme Court will vote 6-3 to abolish affirmative action. It is... On its face, it is a violation of equal protection of the law. Some groups are favored because of race or ethnicity. It is a classic violation of equal protection clause. When affirmative action was approved, the deciding vote was Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. She wrote a very famous opinion in which she said, "I hesitate to vote to keep up, to affirm the notion of affirmative action because it's such an obvious violation of equal protection. But we have an urgent problem in the society. We are not educating our members of racial and ethnic minorities and we have to try to get them into our colleges." So, I think it should be approved for 25 years. And it will... It should be... It should... In 25 years, it should have performed its role. Well, it hasn't. And the 25 years is coming up. I think it's three or four years left. The Supreme Court is going to abolish it. You can take my word for that. Because it is such an obvious violation of equal protection. Why do... Why did affirmative action come into play? Because the secondary and elementary schools are so bad. Public secondary and elementary schools are so bad. Why are they so bad? Partly because of the control that the teachers' union has. Randy Weingarten runs the public school system in the United States. And what I have suggested is that the effort should be to... This is an emergency. It's a national emergency to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education. And one way to do it is to hire teachers who are fabulous teachers rather than necessarily members of the union. I have come to oppose public workers' unions. I am a very strong supporter of unions in the private sector. Why do I think there's such a difference between unions in the public sector and the private sector? In the private sector, management is arguing, bargaining with its own money and with the money of shareholders. In the public sector, there's only one side. There is the teachers' union and then there's a school committee that is dealing with the taxpayers' money, not their own. And so it's a very skewed power balance. So, as supportive as I am of private sector unions, I am in opposition of public sector unions. They're very destructive. And I think without teachers' union, teachers who are really skilled will be able to get jobs. They would not have to worry about the seniority of teachers who long since have given up really creative teaching. And we have to improve the public educational system. I had, my late wife and I had a classmate, we have a son who's now 44 who went to the public schools in Cambridge. He has a friend, first name Eugene, who was a black kid from Roxbury, whose mother understood that the schools in Roxbury were terrible, the schools in Cambridge were pretty good. He lived in our house Monday to Friday, and he went to school with Isaac in the Cambridge public schools. Elsa and I would show up to school committee meetings when there was bargaining between the teachers' union and the school committee. The teachers' union objected to our being there. We argued, we're taxpayers. We have a kid in the school, and we have his best friend lives with us, and goes to school with him. We have a real interest. And the school committee walked out of the bargaining session. The city council then reconsidered its vote, and they voted that citizens, taxpayers, parents of kids in the school, could not show up to these negotiation sessions. I thought that was absolutely outrageous. But I understood why. Because these contracts are crazy. No sane municipality should enter into some of these contracts. And so I am a I have become an opponent of the National Teachers Association. They came to the Teachers Association. I don't think there should be unions for public employees. Because there's no real bargaining going on. And I think that the public school system will never be improved as long as the teachers are unionized. So that to you is at the core of the problem that results in the kind of inequality of opportunity that affirmative actions is designed to solve. Correct. If the educational system in the elementary and high school levels is improved, we wouldn't need affirmative action. These kids would get good educations. So from all backgrounds, poor kids in the United States will get good education if public unions are abolished. Correct. And incidentally, the postal service would probably work better too. That's a whole another conversation. But to you, at the core of the problem of the inequality in universities, that diversity, inclusion, and equity programs are trying to solve is the public education system of secondary education. Correct. Elementary and secondary. Elementary and secondary education. Well then, is there use? What is the benefit? What is the drawback of D.I.E., diversity, inclusion, and equity programs at universities like Harvard? It's an affirmative action, basically. And what it does is it allows the system of elementary and secondary education to be bad. Because they could say, "Oh, we got our kids into Harvard." Yes, but you haven't educated them. And it covers up the wound. And I think we will never improve as long as we're able to cover up the wound. And as I said, affirmative action is going to be abolished by the Supreme Court. It's a clear violation of equal protection. It's what San Francisco Day O'Connor understood but ignored intentionally, but as an experiment. And I believe it's going to be abolished, and that's going to force the elementary and high schools to get serious. Do you see the same issues that you discuss now at Harvard, at MIT? We're here in Boston, so I have to talk about the great universities here in Boston. You've written about MIT. It's a university I love. I'm a research scientist there. Do you see the same kind of issues there? Yes, I do. Do you remember, can you explain the case of the Dorian Abbott lecture that was canceled at MIT? This is not the only incident. There have been incidents all around the country of academics, professors who have views that don't comport the same way. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point.
