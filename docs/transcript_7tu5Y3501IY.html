So I'm just going to take these crazy risks and hope something works out because the old nine to five, put it in the 401k, build wealth slowly.</p><p>That's for a prior generation. And this isn't everyone there, obviously, but I think there is a little bit of that nothing matters. So let's just put it on red or black and see what happens. And I think people do graduate from that mindset eventually. But again, I think the fact that generation has technology and a risk mindset, I think most of them will be okay.</p><p>And I think a lot of them are starting to invest earlier and get experience. And so even if they blow themselves up trading triple levered ETFs or options, same day options, wherever it is, if they're doing it with less money before they start saving and putting stuff away, eventually those habits change and they realize, okay, maybe I need more of a slow and steady approach.</p></div></div></body></html>
