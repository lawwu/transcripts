I actually lost my third gen AirPods and I'm still happy enough with the second gen ones. So I've just kept them. I did try the Pro AirPods and the AirPod Max's didn't like those, returned them. On the computer side, I use an M2 MacBook Air, really love it.</p><p>Got a great sticker on here. My other vehicle is a 401k. Love that. Then let's see, I use a magic keyboard and a magic track pad. I don't use an actual mouse. I really want the new magic keyboard that has the built-in touch ID, but I don't have that right now.</p><p>I kind of wish I did, but it's one of those things that doesn't feel absolutely necessary.</p></div></div></body></html>
