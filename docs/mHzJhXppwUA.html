loop is that you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">a continuous

target="_blank">00:03:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">many ways this talk the short talk is really about like the older feedback loop and how we can accelerate</span></div><div class="c"><span

was at stripe when we were kicking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of a new project before we logged in any major considerations design decisions or really made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe trapdoor decisions we made sure that there was a feedback loop in place and what did that boil down to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">three things we had real users that could see something we had a way to get feedback from them we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">iterate and ship an improvement and the goal was we could do this in less than a day ideally faster if you ask Patrick he would say hours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and and really like the reality is that if you cannot run your loop in a day your process is broken you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">problem you cannot get feedback fast enough and now I know this is easy to say and this gets exponentially harder as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you're in a bigger company and you have a lot of complexity to manage but this should be your goal and I'm not saying that you need to ship every day but the key thing is that you need to be able to ship every day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to be able to get this feedback loop going as fast as possible and this might sound very basic but you need to be very specific about the customers you're building your feature your product for and I know like we all have been running our personas we all been like doing our UXR and user studies and what I mean by being specific is that you should actually work with real people that you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">people that have a name an email somebody you can call and if you don't know any real people but you only have your UXR persona you have a problem as well because you need to get to know your users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and the other thing is that you actually need to understand the real people you're working with how they're solving the problem today you need to be in their shoes and understand and build that empathy because it helps you navigate and actually build out hypotheses and how you're gonna solve it and make it better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we did a stripe is that once we understood the problem we had real people building building building wealth we articulated our hypotheses but we also wrote the PIFQ or the launch blog post</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do think this is one of the easiest steps to miss and I think it's almost always a mistake not to sit down and write the launch blog post</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you writing the PIFQ or the press release of the blog post forces you to write something specific to your audience as to sanity check things you can communicate the product you understand what's being built you know how to shape it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know how to like position it to your users and you know when there was an API we put drafting the API it'd be a rough outline but we have an idea and we were in front of our users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Heck it's 2025 we can bytecode this we can add chat GPT or Claude to do it but just going through this process was critical for us to selling the feedback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we are working with our early users we push shipping this document to them getting feedback before we even went out building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we were doing a prototype in Figma or Bolt these days and this was how we made sure that from day one we had a product feedback loop and we had real feedback getting to us as we were building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And another thing I learned over the years is that it's incredibly hard to do this but you've got to design your best product before you start considering all the constraints like legal compliance financial etc</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What I mean by this is that it's very easy to sit down and when you kick off a product to understand all the legal constraints all the financials</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's not how you build the best product sure like by the day you ship in production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to have a product as financial viable compliant ticks all the boxes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But you cannot let your legal counterparts be the ones that are this applying judgment over your product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The way I've been working with my counterparts and it's really about like they are here to help me understand the legal risks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But they are not the shaping the product and I really think it's just important that you think about like working with your various counterparts in your organization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That they can help you understand the product space but it's your job to actually make those calls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And here in 2025 like the reality is that we can actually build an incredible amount of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think back then we were doing paper prototypes we were doing a lot of things but today we can just bytecode iterations of the product shape</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reality is that you have really no excuse whether you're a product leader or you are an engineer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You have no excuse not to do a prototype because it's gotten so easy to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just think this is important to internalize regardless of whether you have a technical background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzJhXppwUA&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You're mostly
