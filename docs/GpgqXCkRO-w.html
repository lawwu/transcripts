The jerky is a very high protein to calorie ratio, so it has as much as 10 grams of protein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">per jerky stick, and it has something like only like 55 calories.

But it's the same way you formulate a question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then a hypothesis, and then you just go see what is and what isn't.

And then he made this huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5017" target="_blank">01:23:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred million dollar movie.

The problem was when I decided to do the podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5227" target="_blank">01:27:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I had even recorded the first several episodes.

And I said, "I don't really feel comfortable reading ads. I don't think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5243" target="_blank">01:27:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">something I can do well." I said, "I'm cool with the idea of only advertising products I believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5249" target="_blank">01:27:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in or that I use because that's, if I get to essentially promote something, I'll do that with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5255" target="_blank">01:27:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">things that I use, but I don't feel comfortable reading it."

And it was just solving this problem of needing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5284" target="_blank">01:28:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a way to have an advertisement that I didn't feel bad about. And then I got inspired and had this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5291" target="_blank">01:28:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">idea and started making them. And now they're my favorite thing in the podcast. In many podcasts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5296" target="_blank">01:28:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">honestly, when the ads come up, I forward through them as a listener. On Tetra Grammaton, when a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w&t=5304" target="_blank">01:28:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">commercial comes on, I always listen to them.
