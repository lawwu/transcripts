It's not an afterthought, because it's going to narrow down the set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">questions that you're asking. And so accordingly, it's going to narrow down the set of answers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're looking for. If you look at the benchmarks we're using for LLMs, they're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">memorization-based benchmarks. Like sometimes they're literally just knowledge-based, like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">school test. And even if you look at the ones that are, you know, explicitly about reasoning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you realize, if you look closely, that in order to solve them, it's enough to memorize a finite set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of reasoning patterns. And then you just reapply them. They're like static programs. LLMs are very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">good at memorizing static programs, small static programs. And they've got this sort of like bank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of solution programs. And when you give them a new puzzle, they can just fetch the appropriate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">program, apply it, and it's looking like it's reasoning, but really it's not doing any sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on-the-fly program synthesis. All it's doing is program fetching. So you can actually solve all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">these benchmarks with memorization. And so what you're scaling up here, like if you look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">models, they are big parametric curves fitted to a data distribution, which I can't understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're basically these big interpolative databases, interpolative memories. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if you scale up the size of your database and you cram into it more knowledge, more patterns,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on, you are going to be increasing its performance as measured by a memorization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">benchmark. That's kind of obvious. But as you're doing this, you are not increasing the intelligence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the system one bit. You are increasing the skill of the system. You are increasing its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">usefulness, its scope of applicability, but not its intelligence because skill is not intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the fundamental confusion that people run into is that they're confusing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">skill and intelligence. As far as the interpolation goes, so okay, let's look at one of the benchmarks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">here. There's one benchmark that does great school math, and these are problems that like a smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">high schooler would be able to solve. It's called GSM 8K, and these models get 95% on these. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, they always nail it. That's the memorization benchmark. Okay, let's talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what that means. So here's one question from that benchmark. So 30 students are in a class,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">1/5 of them are 12-year-olds, 1/3 are 13-year-old, 1/10 are 11-year-olds. How many of them are not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">11, 12, or 13 years old? So I agree, this is not rocket science, right? You can write down on paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how you go through this problem, and a high school kid, at least a smart high school kid, should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">able to solve it. Now, when you say memorization, it still has to reason through how to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">fractions, and what is the context of the whole problem, and then combining the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">calculations it's doing. It depends how you want to define reasoning, but there are two definitions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use. So one is, I have available a set of program templates. It's like the structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the puzzle, which can also generate its solution. And I'm just going to identify the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right template, which is in my memory. I'm going to input the new values into the template, run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the program, get the solution. And you could say this is reasoning. And I say, yeah, sure, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But another definition you can use is reasoning is the ability to, when you're faced with a puzzle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">given that you don't have already a program in memory to solve it, you must synthesize on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fly a new program based on bits of pieces of existing programs that you have. You have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">do on the fly program synthesis. And it's actually dramatically harder than just fetching the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">memorized program and replying it. I think maybe we are overestimating the extent to which humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are so sample efficient, they also don't need training in this way where they have to drill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in these kinds of pathways of reasoning through certain kinds of problems. So let's take math,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for example. It's not like you can just show a baby the axioms of set theory, and now they know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">math, right? So when they're growing up, you had to do years of teaching them pre-algebra, then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">got to do a year of teaching them doing drills and going through the same kind of problem in algebra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then geometry, pre-calculus, calculus. Absolutely. So training...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but isn't that like the same kind of thing where you can't just see one example and now you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have the program or whatever. You actually had to drill it. These models also had to drill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with a bunch of returning data. Sure. I mean, in order to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on the fly program synthesis, you actually need building blocks to work from. So knowledge and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7B-LHiaNo&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">memory are actually tremendously important in the process.
