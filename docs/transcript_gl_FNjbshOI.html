You're not listening to YouTube inspiration video. Those would be all your voice anyway. (laughs) You're not listening to your top 10 favorite songs just to get rolling and then lace the shoes, hit the books. It's all in here. - All in there. I used to do that when I was fat, Rocky. I mean, people know that that was my thing. Round 14 was my thing. And as I got older and older and older, that started to go away. And I started to create, I had all these people that I used to watch. Rocky was one, Barnes, Elias from Platoon, Jack from A Few Good Men. You know, he's on the stand going crazy. I saw a lot of these characters that I looked at and I was like, man, I ain't got none of that. But they were characters. After a while, I lived a life so disciplined that everybody that I once looked to, these fake characters, I built that as a man. And when I was younger, I had this image in my mind of what does a man look like to me? And I got all these people who were bad-ass characters. And in my mind, I became that. And that's what kept me going a lot, was I had this pipe dream of becoming a little bit of this and a little bit of that. 'Cause when you have no parents raising you and you have no role models growing up, it's not daydreaming. You start to create a reality like, hmm, maybe I can be that. And after becoming this guy, that is the biggest thing I can ever do in my life is I became that guy. That I once looked at all these guys, now look at myself like, God, who the fuck can do that? I can. But what it takes is a discipline that no one can ever even... They don't understand it. They don't understand. Everybody has the ability to do it, but they just don't want to. They wanna keep asking questions and keep going to seminars. And the greatness is right in you. And that's why, once again, I'll say this a million times here, I do not feel sorry for you. I will not sugar coat what I'm going to say to you because all of you know what I'm saying is the truth. Everybody knows it's the truth. This is what it looks like. And you know it too. You know it too. If you ain't got nothing, I hate to tell you what it looks like is ugly. It's not a documentary. It's not an HBO special. You ain't gonna watch it. But hey, man, you guys gotta watch this. No, it's like, oh God, this looks like a train wreck. It's like a nightmare. It's like this guy got, no, it's what it looks like. Hard work looks horrible. It's not motivating. It's not motivating at all. It ain't like "Rocky" round 14 where he gets knocked down and he goes like this to Apollo Creed. It looks like a man being stuck in a fucking dungeon and there's no fucking way out. But you had the fucking key. But you refused to use it. And that's nothing motivating about that. So yes, no documentary on David Goggins. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) you</p></div></div></body></html>
