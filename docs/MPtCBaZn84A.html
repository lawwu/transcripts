We're building multilingual conversational AI agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I know it's a bit of a mouthful. But yeah, hopefully we'll get something going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So different than on the poster, we're not from Evelyn Labs, we're from Eleven Labs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I get a quick show of hands? Have you heard of Eleven Labs? Okay. Everyone has heard of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great. So we can do some nice things today. Maybe look at some new stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you haven't played with yet. So this is me. I'm Thor here on the right side of the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I work on developer experience at Eleven Labs. So a lot of it is kind of the conversational AI agents platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also have my colleague Paul here with me. So if you have kind of any questions, you know, throughout the workshop later on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll be floating around and, you know, happy to kind of, you know, answer your questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So feel free to just put your hand up and we'll be floating around later. Yeah. Paul works with me on developer experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have any feedback as well, you know, on documentation, examples, developer experience, or generally just the product, do let us know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Also this, you can scan the QR code to get the slides. So there's a couple of resources that are linked in the slides, as well as there's a form where you can fill in your email address if you want to get some credits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can give you, you know, a couple of credits for the next three months to sort of, you know, play around with Eleven Labs and kind of try this out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, feel free to just scan this and then, you know, kind of save this for later on. There's the resources linked in there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Yeah. Also, if you're building with Eleven Labs, I recommend you follow our Eleven Labs Devs Twitter account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is specifically for, you know, updates in terms of API versions, client libraries. So anything, you know, if you're a developer building with Eleven Labs, that's a good place to follow and kind of, you know, be in the loop with what is happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, yeah, I mentioned, so if you if you scan the QR code earlier, there's also the link so you can tap on the QR code as well to open the form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you just fill in your email address, we will send you after this workshop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the workshop, you can get started with kind of the free account. That should be should be plenty. But then, you know, we'll we'll give you a coupon code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll send it to you via email for kind of the next three months to to try it out. Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I mentioned, yeah, the resources in the slide. So we'll, you know, kind of tap into these later on and then can kind of, you know, get started building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see as well kind of what folks are building, you know, since we're looking at kind of multilingual conversational AI agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you just want to shout out kind of the languages that, you know, you're specifically looking to unlock with conversational AI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyone, you know, anything else than English? Any other languages? Portuguese.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Portuguese. Very nice. You're looking for like a Brazilian Portuguese accent or cool. Yeah, we can we can look at that. So we've got Portuguese.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Any other languages? Spanish. Yes, we got some Spanish in there as well. That's good. So Portuguese, Spanish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Hungarian. Very good. I'm actually do we have Hungarian right now? We don't. Yes, but I think hopefully soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're working on the version three of the multilingual models. And I do think we'll we'll need to double check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Not that I promise something wrong, but we might be able maybe not today, but maybe in a couple of weeks we can give you Hungarian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great. OK. Any other Mandarin? Hindi. Yeah. Huge population that speaks Hindi. Then again, India has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">50 plus languages, I believe. So we're working on some adding some additional currently with Hindi and Tamil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're working on some additional languages there. OK. So we have a good mix that we can play around with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Yeah. If there's any other languages later, we can, you know, kind of explore those as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe one language that probably doesn't get spoken about often enough is barking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, if you want to build applications for the 900 million dogs that are out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually looked this up. You can use our model. So this is our most recent launch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Two months ago now, I believe that the newest model we launched. So maybe we can can have a little listen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The Dachshund is my favorite, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The Golden Retriever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to have a great use case for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Did anyone see this launch like two months ago? No? Yeah. You saw it? Yeah. The unfortunate thing is we launched it 1st of April, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so everyone thought it was in April Fools. So the timing was a bit unfortunate on that one. But as you can see, you know, text to bark, it's very real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in fact, it was an April Fools. So be careful when you play this to your dog. They might get offended.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the context, we can't guarantee that it translates. But the actual sounds that you're hearing are generated by our sound effects model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we do have a model. If you go to the app, there is this sound effects model here. And you can actually -- this sound effect was also created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But so truck reversing. Maybe that's a good one. You can click generate. And so basically what we do is we generate kind of four different samples for you that you can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, not so interesting for your conversations per se. But like, you know, if you're creating video games, for example. I don't know if anyone is doing that. We might be having some internet. I hope we have internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No? Okay. The internet is looking okay. So, yeah, not sure what's happening here. But so, for example, this was like a drum cowbell I generated recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, we do have a -- if you Google 11 labs sound board. We built this recently, which was -- which is pretty cool. So you can kind of loop -- it's basically like a drum machine. And you can get kind of the --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sound effects. The drums are pretty nice as well. And, you know, they are mapped to like the keys on the keyboard. So you can -- you can play like --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's pretty cool. And then you can add kind of new sound effects and stuff. You know, just to give you an idea of some of the things that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously here, you know, we're talking -- we're talking about conversational AI agents. And so, specifically, if we kind of look at the different components that are involved in building conversational AI agents, we have the user who is speaking, you know, some language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we need to transcribe that speech into text. We then feed that into a large language model, which is kind of acting as the brain of, you know, our agent. So in our case, we currently don't build any intelligence models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we partner with kind of the existing large language models providers. So like your GPT-4O, your Google, Gemini, what have you. And then this large language model, which will act as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of the brain of your agent will generate a text output. And then we basically stream that text output back into speech. So that is roughly kind of the pipeline that we have for building conversational AI agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, with that, there is a bunch of system tools that are built in. So for example, we have this language detection system tool, which facilitates the language switching that we're going to look at in a bit. We also have, you know, function calling, tool calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, if you need to give access to kind of specific functionality to your agent, you can, you can do that here as well. And then, you know, there's different approaches. So like if you've seen open AI real time, for example, so this doesn't actually go through text, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it goes sound token to sound token, which has some benefits. But what we've seen, you know, for deploying conversational AI agents at scale, and really understanding, you know, what is kind of happening. So if you're going sound token to sound token,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you're kind of flying blind, you're kind of flying blind a little bit. So, you know, you're trusting the model that sort of it actually replies intelligently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas if you're going through text, you can have, you know, kind of better monitoring and sort of understanding what's what's going on in your conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So while we're also exploring, you know, kind of sound to sound for kind of the conversational AI agents, for now what we found works best is sort of this, this pipeline that we've built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we deploy kind of all these models very close to each other to kind of bring down the latency as much as possible. Cool. And so now we can look at kind of the individual sort of components within that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, for speech to text. So this is actually the most recent model we actually launched. You know, that wasn't an April Fools. And so this is our speech to text model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So our automatic speech recognition model, so ASR. And this works, you know, kind of benchmark leading across 99 different languages at the moment. So what this does, you know, you can see sort of the functionality that's built in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, you know, word level timestamps, there's speaker diarization, there's audio event tagging. So if you want in your transcript, you know, cuffing, laughing, sort of some of these, you know, audio tags,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tags in there, you can enable that as well. And it's all kind of within, you know, structured API responses, which is really nice. So what you can see here is for example, you know, we have a conference call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you can see here is as we're kind of playing this audio, we see that the model recognizes the different speakers, and kind of text them as speaker one, speaker two, and then we have the word level timestamp. So you see, as I play this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Jonas, four week timeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you can highlight the different words, kind of, you know, word level here. So that's really, really useful. And, you know, obviously, this is available through the API. So actually, one thing I did, and you can try this out yourself, this is just available kind of for free to sort of demo it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're using Telegram, I've built kind of this little Telegram bot where you can forward voice messages or videos to, you know, the Telegram bot, and then you, it automatically identifies, okay, what language is that? And it gives you back the transcript of that message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, you know this all too well, you're sitting in a meeting, and your grandmother sends you a voice message, and you don't know, oh, is this urgent? Is this important? So what you can do is, you can forward it to the bot, and very quickly, you will get the transcript back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you want to try this out, you know, you can, you can do that. So you can see it here. I was actually, I hope you, you recognize this, if you were paying attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyone recognize this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, I was just saying that. So I was just recording a voice message on my phone. Thank you. Someone was paying attention. That's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, I was just recording a voice message, and then I get the transcript back. Now, the cool thing as well, so I actually live in Singapore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you spend time in Singapore, you might have heard kind of the Singlish, right, which is sort of the Singapore English.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Go to hell, this person. Bastard, you know. You ask for a plastic bag, you must put the thing inside the plastic bag for me, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">She never, she just put the plastic bag, throw the plastic bag on the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, anyone understand what's going on? Do we got any Singaporeans in the house? No?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not that easy. Even after six years in Singapore, I still sometimes struggle with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we can do is we can forward it to our transcription bot. We can see, okay, it was received. It's transcribing it now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, go to hell. Bastard, you know, I asked for a plastic bag. You must put the thing inside the plastic bag for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can, you can see these are kind of the problems we have in Singapore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Singapore. Now, another accent that might be a bit challenging. Um, Scottish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Hello there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some things I need to know about Scotland.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Eh, well, you need to know that they're trying to split up the country, you know that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't want that. We want that. We want that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I do some council and that's basically right. That is pretty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyone understand what's going on in Scotland? No? Okay. No Scottish people here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, again, we can forward it. We can see. Um, and so this is, this is really cool actually that, um, you know, even without fine tuning the model, it can actually understand specific accents, um, quite well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you need to know they're trying to split up the country and all that. And we don't want that. We want a decent council and all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's basically that. There you go. I actually now listen to this so often that I can actually hear it. Um, but yeah, you might, you might not be familiar with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, one example that's maybe a bit, um, closer to where you're living, if you're here in the US.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And Mr. President, what we would like to say about the Bangladesh issue, because we saw and it is evident that how the deep state of United States was involved to regime change during the Biden administration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Muhammad Yunus made, uh, Junior Soros also. So what is your, your point of view about the Bangladesh?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And what is the role that the deep state played in this situation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are you seeing here is, uh, uh, president has, um, a translator for English to English, um, translation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we thought, you know, maybe he can just use this transcription bot. So if we forward that, um, again, so even if the audio quality isn't that great, if there's like a lot of background noise, the model is actually very good at kind of identifying that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah, so this is kind of the, you know, one component to it. So we need to, um, you know, understand what the user is saying and then feed that into our LLM, uh, to, you know, have kind of a meaningful conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So for the other part, um, you know, we, we don't specifically provide the intelligence layer. So that's where we partner with kind of, you know, the leading, um, model providers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also fine tune your own model. Um, you know, if you, for example, fine tune and deploy it on say Google Vertex AI, you just need an open AI API compatible endpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and then you can plug in your custom LLM into this pipeline as well, um, which we can look at in a, in a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we have the other component. So once the LLM starts streaming out the response, we then want to start streaming the speech as soon as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so this pipeline is kind of streaming throughout. So we have, you know, the, the fastest kind of snappiest, um, response possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So for, you know, the actual text to speech, what's great with 11 labs, you know, we heard we want kind of, um, Brazilian Portuguese accent, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a huge library, um, of voices that are available on the platform. So we actually have more than 5,000 different voices, um, that you can choose from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you go into your 11 labs account, um, you can go to voices and you can explore, um, different voices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you were sitting, you know, here in this workshop and you were like, Oh, I really like this voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You're in luck. So you can go to the voice library and you can type in German engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm originally from Germany and you find me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">True success is doing what you are born to do and doing it well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that sound like me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, okay. It's, it's trained on some of my, uh, YouTube videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think maybe I talk a bit differently, um, in the YouTube videos, but yeah, this is, this is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing is, so I basically cloned my voice, uh, and I published it on the voice library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so anytime you use that voice, uh, I get royalties. Um, so this is a marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, we actually, uh, recently just surpassed the 5 million US dollar milestone that we paid out to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you know, our voice actors that are kind of publishing their, their voices on the platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, in this workshop, if you use this voice, uh, I'll be very grateful because then, uh, I can have a coffee later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great. Um, no, but obviously, you know, you can use my voice if you want to, you don't have to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the great thing is you can set really kind of narrow filters to find sort of the voice that, you know, you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if you want to choose, um, Portuguese, uh, you can just put the language filter to Portuguese</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you can choose kind of the accent. So here, for example, uh, we want to Brazilian Portuguese.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We can then further kind of narrow this down in terms of, you know, sort of gender, age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's certain meta, meta tags that we can apply. Uh, and then we can see maybe here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Não há fracasso, exceto em não tentar mais.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I don't, I don't know. I haven't spent much time in Brazil, um, so...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, I mean, there's a lot of voices available on the platform, so you can kind of see, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">if you find one that, that sort of fits, you know, the local accent that you're, that you're looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and then what you can do is you can, um, go and kind of put, you know, all these different pieces together into your conversational, um, AI agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So here, in the dashboard, we can go to conversational AI, um, and we can actually configure a lot of our agent, you know, right there within the dashboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can bring that into our application with, um, the JavaScript SDKs, the Python SDKs, kind of depending on, um, what applications you're building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so we can just do a quick demo maybe of an agent that, um, I had built for, uh, a conference in Singapore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, you know, if you're familiar with Singapore, there is, uh, four official government languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're building applications, you know, for Singapore, you actually need to, you know, provide, uh, English, Mandarin, Chinese, Malay, uh, and Tamil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are kind of the official government languages in Singapore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously there is other languages, uh, being spoken, you know, Hindi, Japanese, for example, um, you know, as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But what you can do is you can, uh, we, so we currently have within conversational AI, uh, I think 31, um, different languages that the agent can speak and switch between and identify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we're working on the next iteration, so the V3 of our multilingual models, which will, uh, bring, I believe, up to 99 different languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, yeah, you know, no matter where you are in the world, you can kind of get there pretty, pretty good coverage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so you can see here we can configure the LLM, so we can, you know, choose kind of, uh, any of the, the, you know, big LLM providers that are out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have directly integrated, uh, and kind of co-located with, with our platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, or you can put in your custom LLM, which is just an open AI API, uh, compatible endpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you can put in kind of a knowledge base, uh, you can upload documents, you can, you know, reference your website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there's RAG built in as well, uh, depending on kind of the model you're using, um, you might not want to put kind of the entire knowledge base into the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can, you can enable RAG there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then the tools, you know, this is kind of your standard function calling, um, you know, that you might be familiar with when you're working with, um, large language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, depending on the model you choose as well, um, there might be some nuances with how reliably the function calling works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, kind of the larger ones, GPT-4, um, plus Gemini 2.5, you know, these are generally very reliable with function calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have the system tools that are kind of built in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can see here the language detection system tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we can just enable this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and we have this kind of, you know, configured by default to identify different languages and switch between them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but you can also override kind of the, the LLM prompt to sort of customize that to your use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then maybe we can just give that a little test and see how that works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi there.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what languages can you speak?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what languages can you speak?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what languages can you speak?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is kind of the built-in language detection system tool that we can use to facilitate kind of these multilingual conversations, which is really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is kind of roughly what I wanted to show you, sort of as a start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And now what we can do is kind of we have, you know, the next 30 minutes to play around with this yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're in the room and, you know, if you have any questions, we can answer them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there is various different ways that you can configure your agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, by default, you can get started in the dashboard and you can configure kind of a lot of the behavior and functionality in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, if you go back to the resources, we have, you know, the documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have different examples that you can use around conversational AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, there's, you know, we have examples for Next.js to build that into your Next.js applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have examples for Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to build it, you know, on, like, hardware devices somewhere, you might want to use Python on, like, your Raspberry Pi, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we have the examples there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can then, once you've configured that, you can bring that into, you know, your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Alternatively, you can also configure all nuances of your agents via the API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, actually, if you're building a marketplace where you are configuring agents on behalf of someone else, you know, you would generally do that through the API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also have an MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you're using, you know, Cloud desktop, you can bring in the MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can just tell in natural language, oh, please, you know, set up an 11-lapse conversational AI agent, you know, with this voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll go and it knows kind of what, you know, API calls to make to set up your agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, thanks so much for joining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have any questions, you know, we'll be floating around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also ask the questions now, you know, if you want to ask it kind of in the audience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But, otherwise, you know, please just go to 11lapse.io and create your account if you don't have one already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you just go to app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Go to conversational AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can create here in the agent's interface, you can create a new agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe we'll just start off with kind of the support agent here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can go through and kind of configure this agent with, you know, your voices, your languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, yeah, we'd love to hear a lot of different agents speak, you know, at the end of the next 30 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.320</a></span> | <span

much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do let us know your questions and we'll be here for the next 30 minutes to help you set up your agent yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1710"

target="_blank">00:28:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Did anyone have questions that they wanted to ask in the room?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I think you're welcome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like microphones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you want to just go up to the microphone and ask?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Hello, everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, great presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is related to you said that it can switch to different languages without fine tuning it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what is the background process of it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you explain it a bit more like how well it shifts so perfectly that it can interact in the regional languages as well as the accent is also similar to that kind of thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so here, what you can see is in my agent configuration, so I can actually, within the voices tab, I can assign different voices to the different languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, in Singapore, the most commonly spoken Tamil accent in Singapore is the Chennai accent Tamil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically, I went to the voice library and I found a voice that is a Chennai accent Tamil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I then basically added that to my voice library and just assigned that here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the voices tab, you can configure the different voices for the different languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Which then means that, you know, the, so the actual language detection part, that is the automatic speech recognition model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the ASR model will actually identify which language, you know, with, so it basically assigns kind of a score, like a likelihood score, that this is the language that is being spoken, as well as the transcript.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically, we use kind of with the system tool, based on the confidence score of this language being spoken, we then automatically switch to their language in the background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically use the voice that you configured to reply with for this language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that roughly answer the question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, do you mind coming forward?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So just, because I think it's also being recorded, then we have it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Great presentation, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Quick question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, other than the changing of the language or language detection or whatnot, does it have any other ability to make any other actions throughout the call?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, use case appointment setting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it have actions to maybe call a webhook and to take a look to see if there's any appointments available, either in make or NN and then report back?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we can have that in the prompts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, the configuration of that is a combination of your system prompt together with the tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can configure custom tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, these can be server-side tools, which then would be a webhook call, you know, to your CRM, to your system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is, you know, the standard kind of tool calling, function calling that the LLM supports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, like GPT-40 or like the more modern models generally support function calling and structured outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, as long as the large language model that you're using to power your agent supports function calling, you can add your tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this can be a combination of server-side tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, you know, as you mentioned, like the scheduling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can put in, so, for example, we also have an example with cal.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can put in the API endpoints for cal.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the agent can actually look up, oh, okay, is there availability in the calendar?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can schedule, so it can ask for like the email address.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it can schedule, you know, the meeting for all the parties kind of through the conversational AI agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, one more question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What would you suggest would be a good structure for a conversational agent that has like super low latency?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, the model plays a big role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, obviously, like price and model or like price and the latency are like the two biggest key factors when you want to do like a outbound or inbound dialing agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=1998"

total cost per minute coming down to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You mean like by default?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it kind of depends what pricing tier you're on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you go to the pricing page, so here, conversational AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, depending on kind of the tier you're on, the, you know, there's a certain amount of minutes that are included.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, currently, the pricing is based on call minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, depending on which tier you're on, there is additional minutes that are charged at a specific price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it does somewhat depend on kind of the pricing tier that you're on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to have like an application where you need like really long interaction times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you want to do a companion that will talk to you while you cook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2191" target="_blank">00:36:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there something you can do to mitigate that cost?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The timing cost?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2196" target="_blank">00:36:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think like for those use cases, it might not be great at the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because like if they are just running this like 24/7 to like be able to talk to someone, the cost is pretty significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we, I mean, there's potentially like if you reach out to the sales team, there is some like custom pricing that we can do based on the use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think for now, this is charged based on minutes used like that the session, the session is life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And final question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried to do an agent in your dashboard and it had several tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2241" target="_blank">00:37:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it was one onboarding task, then another follow up task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it kind of got confused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it was not like identifying when to do one task, when to do the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, is there a way to mitigate this or maybe have a multi-agent configuration?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's, we have what we call agent to agent, agent to agent transfers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one way to do this is to, you know, basically set this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this is, this is a system tool as well, where you basically set up different agents for different use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like certain use cases, you also might use, want to use a different LLM to power that use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of, you know, depending on which LLM is sort of best for the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can configure different agents for different tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can configure kind of an orchestration setup that basically will then route kind of in the background to a different agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you keep the voice the same, this actually happens somewhat like silently without the user actually knowing that they're being transferred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's not like, it's an immediate transfer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It just means that you can, you know, sort of develop these agents potentially also across teams where you have, you know, one team that owns kind of this specific agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the background, you just kind of switch between the agents for like the different tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2338" target="_blank">00:38:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Great. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Any more questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Latency. So, in general, like simple examples usually, you know, great for demos, but when you have something more heavy, more enterprise grade, and you have more data, more, you know, your rags taking time to come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you not have a shitty experience because, you know, think of it from the end user's perspective, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They're like, ah, it was like, then blank for the next minute or two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you suggest fillers? Like, you know, does the conversational AI say, I'm thinking, let me think about it? Or how do you kind of make it more natural?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there is going to be like an enterprise setup, right? Like if I have to then go look up a patient's claim, you know, that might go hit a database, once that comes back, it goes to other systems, does a whole bunch of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But it takes time. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, how do you set it up so that, you know, latency that can't be avoided? How do we make the conversational experience better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So, there's certain things that you can do. So, you know, generally kind of these are, you know, if you have like a big knowledge base, for example, like using Rack is kind of one way of kind of mitigating, you know, that's taking too much time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also in terms of your tools, when you define your tools, you can configure the, where is it? Kind of the response time. So, when you, you know, add parameters, where was the configuration?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Where was the configuration? I think there's a configuration for, yeah, like the timeout. So, basically how long you want to wait for, you know, this tool to sort of come back. And also if you want to wait sort of for the response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think the maximum timeout we allow is like 120 seconds. And then the agent will actually like say, oh, I'm currently looking that up in the system. Sorry, you know, we're still waiting kind of on the response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that is sort of built into the tooling here. Now, you know, depending on your, yeah, like use case, you probably want to, to, to put that kind of, you know, fairly low. Because like, yeah, if you're waiting on the call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder if you can do something where it's like, oh, I'll call you back, you know, like, I'll take that back and like take the action or, but I think for now it would just, yeah, depending on your timeout time, it basically will wait for the response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will tell, like, it will stay conversational to like, you know, talk the user through that, oh, we're still waiting on the tool response there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And are all conversations linear? Or can they branch off, come back? Like, while it's looking up something, can it come back in five minutes later? Oh, you know, I found, you know, in the meantime, they get other details from the customer or patient or who else?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I, that's a good question. I don't think so. I think, yeah, currently, you would, I think in that case, you would like orchestrate it in a way where you put it into a queue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The only thing then is like, how do you update the agent? I think like if you're using the, I would need to kind of look this up, there might be a way, like with the web sockets, where like as information comes back, you can inject that additional information into the conversation through a web socket notification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, I would need to look up kind of that specific use case because then what you could do is, you put these tasks into a queue, and you work through them in the background and like as kind of the responses come back, you can then inject them back into the context through kind of web socket events, potentially, but would need to double check if that's feasible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, that's all I have. Thanks, man. Cool. Yeah, thanks. Sweet. Is everyone, while we're like going through the questions, is everyone setting up their agents? Are we? No? Okay, good. Yeah, I see someone nodding there. Fantastic. Okay, cheers. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Hello. Could you explain or demonstrate what happens if you have multiple languages within an input and output, and how that might work if you have different accents for each language?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so... So you mean like if the person is kind of mixing different languages? Yeah, like for instance, if they say, "Explain the difference between Schadenfreude and 性在热火" in Chinese.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's a good question. I haven't tested that specifically. Maybe you can try right now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you can try right now? We can, yeah. So what was it? Explain the difference between Schadenfreude and 性在热火。</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Great. Yeah. Okay. Hi there. This is the API Day Singapore conversational AI agent. How can I help you today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you please explain the difference between Schadenfreude and 性在热火?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Schadenfreude is a German term that means the pleasure or satisfaction one feels from witnessing another person's misfortune or failure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a well-known concept and is often used in English as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">However, 性在热火 does not appear to be a recognized term in German or in psychology, and there is no widely accepted meaning for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's possible there may be a spelling error or confusion with another term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Could you clarify what you mean by 性在热火 or provide more context? That way, I can give you a more accurate comparison.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be my pronunciation, but it's meant to be a Chinese term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you for clarifying that you meant a Chinese term. Unfortunately, 性在热火 does not sound like a recognizable phrase in Mandarin or other major Chinese dialects, at least based on that pronunciation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you can provide the Chinese characters a different spelling or more context about what the term describes or when it is used. I may be able to help you identify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it might be my pronunciation, but yeah, the problem is like if you mix, like, you know, well, English and German at least are both like Germanic languages, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And Mandarin is so I think there might be my big challenges there. And like depending on the more languages you mix, it does get does get challenging. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2798" target="_blank">00:46:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have a recommendation then if you want to build like a language learning application, for example?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2804" target="_blank">00:46:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I wonder if there's certain things you can do with like the prompt, the system prompt in terms of like improving how it's being picked up. But yeah, I think because we're like going through text here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the like the language learning use case is a bit more challenging, especially if you're going, um, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2831" target="_blank">00:47:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, Germanic languages versus, um, yeah, it's a good question. I don't have an immediate answer for you there. But, uh, yeah, actually, you might want to try like a sound token to sound token like open AR real time. I wonder if in that case, you might want to try like a sound token to sound token like open AR real time. I wonder if in that case, you might want to try like a sound token to sound token.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like open AR real time. I wonder if in that case it does better because it can, you know, it doesn't go through text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it does. Sometimes it like switches the accents too, which is kind of annoying because it will try to pronounce Chinese for instance in an English accent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, interesting. Yeah. So yeah, there is, there's challenges with that. But yeah, that's a, that's a good one. I'll, I'll take that back and see, you know, kind of how we, so I know we have some, we have a customer in India Supernova that does, but it's specifically English learning for, um, the Indian market. Um, so I think it's a bit of a different use case there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you know if it produces English in a particular accent or is it like using the, you know, Indian phonetic sounds to, um, I think there's, there's like a case study, uh, 11 labs Supernova. So maybe you can, you can look that up. Um, there's a video. So maybe. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. I'll look it up. Thank you so much. Maybe take a look at that. And then we can, yeah, if you, if you connect with us, uh, we can, we can also follow up on kind of some guidance on, on that use case specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Perfect. Thank you. Cool. Thanks. All right. Um, I was curious if you're worried about scammers or fraudsters using these tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So there's definitely, you know, a worry with that, like obviously kind of all this, this technology. So one thing that is kind of very important for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2960" target="_blank">00:49:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can, if you go to 11 labs dot IO slash safety, uh, you can see kind of the safety tools that we're developing, um, you know, uh, in parallel to, to our, um, features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a, there's a bunch of things that we do, um, like specifically, you know, we do like life moderation for certain things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually when you publish your voice to the voice library, you can specify, um, terms that you don't want your voice to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2991" target="_blank">00:49:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and then in this case, we actually have life moderation where, um, we will make sure that your voice isn't used to generate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of specific terms or, um, sentences. Um, we also kind of monitor in general, uh, what's being generated on the platform. Um, so kind of the moderation and, um, sort of the, the other toolings are actually with any, um, speech that is generated on our platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We mark the water market, uh, actually to the extent that we can trace back which account generated, um, this specific speech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so if we identify, um, fraudulent activity, we can actually trace back which account generated kind of that, um, and, you know, can kind of ban them or, you know, provide, um, kind of information to the authorities, um, as needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And so the other things is just kind of in terms of, um, for, uh, we have like, where was the, we have like the voice capture, um, that we developed when you are creating a, um, professional voice clone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, we actually generate kind of a random sentence that you need to read out to verify that, you know, you have permission to clone this, this voice. Um, so yeah, we, we do, you know, with kind of all the technology that we develop, um, we do put, uh, quite a large amount of, you know, focus and effort into, uh, safety tooling. Um, but yeah, there is obviously always a concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, that your technology is being used for fraudulent activity, but I think so far, um, you know, we've been trying to mitigate that with like the safety tooling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely. Yeah. It looks like a lot of good guardrails in place. Thanks. Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yay. You're back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to go. So just building on her one, like, um, in our place, um, if a patient is asked a, you know, how you feeling about this and say they are, um, they, they try to speak in English.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3123" target="_blank">00:52:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They might hold a part of the conversation in English and then they might jump to Spanish, uh, Spanish and Portuguese and come back to English for, you know, like when they have to describe something that they can't in English.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, they kind of jump back to, you know, the, the language that they are most comfortable in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they jump around different languages. Uh, how would, because like the way you explained it, it kind of, you have some kind of a router that checks what kind of language it is and then shoots it off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But within a conversation, they, they kind of jump between like, you know, they'll explain a few things and then they'll go a few words with a way, you know, these words and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So like for you, this, this is like English, Spanish, Portuguese kind of all mixed together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3194" target="_blank">00:53:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes like if you just ask them how you're feeling. Okay. Then they come back. Hey, you know, there's this, you know, I took this medication, it hurts, you know, and then if you say, okay, where's it hurting? How? Then they suddenly kind of, you know, they regress to whatever language is most comfortable to them to explain their thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Gotcha. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can see here that like the transcript that actually correctly identified, you know, schadenfreude, um, because technically it's also an English word price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But then like on the, on the Chinese word, it just completely, you know, well, you know, you can blame partly my pronunciation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably you can blame it a lot, but, um, yeah, I wonder if like a native speaker. Yeah. I don't, I don't have exact benchmarks on like, you know, how much like the transcript gets worse, the more languages you introduce kind of in the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3257" target="_blank">00:54:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think like generally, if you have two languages intermixed, it tends to perform okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But like, if you like now having like three different languages, um, it just, you know, progressively tends to, to get worse, but I don't have, um, exact benchmarks on like, you know, how many languages sort of, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Cool. No, that's, that, that's good to know. That's what I came up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, it would be worthwhile if you have like recordings of like some of that to like put it through our, um, transcription model and see kind of how, how it performs in like identifying that, that, that would be interesting. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Thank you. Uh, save this question toward the end. Cause it's kind of non-related. So, uh, I worked on a project where we use 11 labs, uh, for, uh, the voice track of our avatar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Uh, and at 11 labs function well, but we had a lot of more downstream issues in terms of like lip sync and like, uh, I think someone mentioned like slugs and timing and other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So is there any plan for 11 labs to come like, I guess, further down the stack in terms of like avatars or is, is that even something you're thinking about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, interesting. So you, you, uh, did you build like the, the lip syncing model and like avatar stuff on your, uh, no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, we like within the, like Nvidia Tokyo stack. So they have like, uh, the stack and they have their like Reva voice model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we kind of switched that out for 11 labs. Uh, so they have like the full stack of like the avatar and then 11 labs is just the voice portion of it. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, okay.

It's like, yeah, it'll go from, uh, like we did everything with the, the GPU, but then they have like the visualization and uh, you can just plug your voice model or, or in Tokyo, like T O K K I O.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">T O K K. Hi, you see, I'm, I'm thinking about Japan. Is it this one? Yeah. Oh, interesting. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3393" target="_blank">00:56:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, I, I personally don't have, um, experience with that one. So I know that we're mostly working with partners like Hedra and Hey Jen kind of for sort of the, the avatar side of things. Um, I don't know, Paul, do you know any? No. So this is something I would need to come back to you and like look into. Um, it's, it's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So like you're saying out of the box, it uses like an Nvidia model for speech generation or.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, our client, which I assume is one of your partners. We can talk about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But like our client couldn't use the Nvidia model. Gotcha.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3437" target="_blank">00:57:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Had a contract to use 11 labs model. So. Okay. Interesting. Yeah. Sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't, I don't have a good answer for you there right now, but yeah, this is interesting. We can, we can go back to the team and see, um, if there's any resources that we can, we can give you in terms of like improving that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3457" target="_blank">00:57:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting use case. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Last question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Last question. Nice. Uh, hi Torsten. Thanks for the presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3467" target="_blank">00:57:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question regarding the transcription model around adding custom vocabulary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, uh, at the company I work for, we use a lot of three letter acronyms and, uh, let's say, let's say I want to have the model read out SAP as SAP and not SAP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3485" target="_blank">00:58:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a way to tell it to do that? And is there a way to, uh, like tell it to read words a certain way and kind of nudge the interpretation of what I say towards certain words that we use in our vocabulary?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. Yes. So you have this both. So you have this use case both on like this, the speech to text. So you need to correctly identify the acronyms, but then also you need the agent to reply back with the correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3514" target="_blank">00:58:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So like for the reply back, we do have, um, have you seen the like, um, pronunciation dictionaries? Um, so we have a way for you to provide, um, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3528" target="_blank">00:58:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">pronunciation dictionaries with like kind of phoneme alphabets, uh, to actually, you know, identify specific, uh, you know, basically like here tomato, tomato, I guess, tomato, tomato. Um, and so you can provide for, for that, you can provide the pronunciation dictionary, dictionaries to make sure the text to speech pronounces, you know, the acronyms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3546" target="_blank">00:59:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and the words in the way that you want them to. Now the other side of like the speech to text. That's an interesting case. I don't think we have a word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3568" target="_blank">00:59:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, a way to like fine tune that specifically for different acronyms. That's a good question. So, you know anything there? No, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, interesting. Yeah. So you, you can, to a certain extent, you can do it through the system prompt where you put in kind of a normalization layer to basically identify things in the transcript that are acronyms and then basically have the LLM sort of massage that into, to what you want. I think that's what you were saying, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3619" target="_blank">01:00:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So that could be interesting to see if that works well. Have you, have you tried it out already or? Um, where I was coming from is, uh, the company is using, um, like in their own custom chatbot called jewel and it's like the unit of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3635" target="_blank">01:00:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But whenever I read transcripts, it's oftentimes used as jewel as the diamond. Gotcha. And so that's kind of a struggle that I'm facing. Okay. Is this actually at SAP? Nice. I'm an SAP child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm an SAP child myself. My, my, my father was early as well. Okay. Anyway, too, too much information. Cool. Uh, yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that. Well, we can, we can chat some more and see sort of if that's something we, we can get going. Sweet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtCBaZn84A&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah.
