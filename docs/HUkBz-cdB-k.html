What was the first really difficult research-level math problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that you encountered?

You can make problems arbitrarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">difficult. That's not really a problem. In fact, there's even problems that we know to be unsolvable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What's really interesting are the problems just on the boundary between what we can do easily and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what are hopeless. But what are problems where existing techniques can do 90% of the job and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">then you just need that remaining 10%? I think as a PhD student, the Kakeya problem certainly caught my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">eye. And it just got solved, actually. It's a problem I've worked on a lot in my early research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Historically, it came from a little puzzle by the Japanese mathematician, Soji Kakeya,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in 1918 or so. The puzzle is that you have a needle on the plane. Think of driving on a road.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And you want to execute a U-turn. You want to turn the needle around. But you want to do it in as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">little space as possible. So you want to use this little area in order to turn it around. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">needle is infinitely maneuverable. So you can imagine just spinning it around as a unit needle. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">spin it around its center. And I think that gives you a disk of area, I think pi over four. Or you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">do a three-point U-turn, which is what we teach people in their driving schools to do. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">actually takes area pi over eight. So it's a little bit more efficient than a rotation. And so for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">while, people thought that was the most efficient way to turn things around. But Vesikovic showed that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in fact, you could actually turn the needle around using as little area as you wanted. So 0.001,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">there was some really fancy multi back-and-forth U-turn thing that you could do that you could turn a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">needle around. And in so doing, it would pass through every intermediate direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this in the two-dimensional plane?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is in the two-dimensional plane. So we understand everything in two dimensions. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">next question is what happens in three dimensions? So suppose like the Hubble Space Telescope is tube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in space. And you want to observe every single star in the universe. So you want to rotate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">telescope to reach every single direction. And here's the unrealistic part. Suppose that space is at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">premium, which totally is not. You want to occupy as little volume as possible in order to rotate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your needle around in order to see every single star in the sky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How small a volume do you need to do that? And so you can modify Vesikovic's construction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if your telescope has zero thickness, then you can use as little volume as you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a simple modification of the two-dimensional construction. But the question is that if your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">telescope is not zero thickness, but just very, very thin, some thickness delta, what is the minimum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">volume needed to be able to see every single direction as a function of delta?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So as delta gets smaller, as your needle gets thinner, the volume should go down. But how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">fast does it go down? And the conjecture was that it goes down very, very slowly, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">logarithically, roughly speaking. And that was proved after a lot of work. So this seems like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a puzzle. Why is it interesting? So it turns out to be surprisingly connected to a lot of problems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in partial differential equations, in number theory, in geometry, combinatorics. For example, in wave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">propagation, you splash some water around, you create water waves, and they travel in various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">directions. But waves exhibit both particle and wave type behavior. So you can have what's called a wave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">packet, which is like a very localized wave that is localized in space and moving a certain direction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in time. And so if you plot it into space and time, it occupies a region which looks like a tube.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what can happen is that you can have a wave which initially is very dispersed, but it all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">focuses at a single point later in time. Like you can imagine dropping a pebble into a pond and it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">spread out. But then if you time reverse that scenario, and the equations of wave motion are time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">irreversible. You can imagine ripples that are converging to a single point and then a big splash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">occurs, maybe even a singularity. And so it's possible to do that. And geometrically, what's going on is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there's always light rays. So if this wave represents light, for example, you can imagine this wave as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">superposition of photons all traveling at the speed of light. They all travel on these light rays and they're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">focusing at this one point. So you can have a very dispersed wave, focus into a very concentrated wave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">at one point in space and time, but then it defocuses again and it separates.

So it has practical importance. So this clay prize problem concerns what's called the incompressible Navier-Stokes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">which governs things like water.

So Maxwell's demon is a concept in thermodynamics. Like if you have a box of two gases in oxygen and nitrogen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe you start with all the oxygen on one side and nitrogen on the other side, but there's no barrier between them, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they will mix. And they should stay mixed, right? There's no reason why they should unmix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But in principle, because of all the collisions between them, there could be some sort of weird conspiracy that, like maybe there's a microscopic demon called Maxwell's demon that will, every time an oxygen and nitrogen atom collide, they will bounce off in such a way that the oxygen sort of drifts onto one side and then nitrogen goes to the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could have an extremely improbable configuration emerge, which we never see, and statistically, it's extremely unlikely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But mathematically, it's possible that this can happen, and we can't rule it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a situation that shows up a lot in mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">A basic example is the digits of pi, 3.14159 and so forth.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:10:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no reason it should happen, but there's no way to prove it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">With our current technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so getting back to Navier-Stokes, a fluid has a certain amount of energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And because the fluid is in motion, the energy gets transported around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And water is also viscous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the energy is spread out over many different locations, the natural viscosity of the fluid will just damp out the energy and it will go to zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is what happens when we actually experiment with water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You splash around, there's some turbulence and waves and so forth, but eventually it settles down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the lower the amplitude, the smaller the velocity, the more calm it gets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But potentially there is some sort of demon that keeps pushing the energy of the fluid into a smaller and smaller scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will move faster and faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And at faster speeds, the effect of viscosity is relatively less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it could happen that it creates some sort of self-similar blow-up scenario where the energy of the fluid starts off at some large scale and then it all sort of transfers the energy into a smaller region of the fluid, which then at a much faster rate moves into an even smaller region and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And each time it does this, it takes maybe half as long as the previous one, and then you could actually converge to all the energy concentrating in one point in a finite amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And that scenario is called fat and hand blow-up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in practice, this doesn't happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So water is what's called turbulent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is true that if you have a big eddy of water, it will tend to break up into smaller eddies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But it won't transfer all the energy from one big eddy into one smaller eddy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It will transfer into maybe three or four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then those ones split up into maybe three or four small eddies of their own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the energy gets dispersed to the point where the viscosity can then keep everything under control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But if it can somehow concentrate all the energy, keep it all together, and do it fast enough that the viscous effects don't have enough time to calm everything down, then this blow-up can occur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So there were papers who had claimed that, oh, you just need to take into account conservation of energy and just carefully use the viscosity, and you can keep everything under control for not just Navier-Stokes, but for many, many types of equations like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in the past, there have been many attempts to try to obtain what's called global regularity for Navier-Stokes, which is the opposite of finite time blow-up, that velocity stays smooth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it all failed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There was always some sign error or some subtle mistake, and it couldn't be salvaged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I was interested in doing was trying to explain why we were not able to disprove finite time blow-up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I couldn't do it for the actual equations of fluids, which were too complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I could average the equations of motion of Navier-Stokes, basically, if I could turn off certain types of ways in which water interacts and only keep the ones that I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So in particular, if there's a fluid and it could transfer its energy from a large eddy into this small eddy or this other small eddy, I would turn off the energy channel that would transfer energy to this one and direct it only into this smaller eddy while still preserving the law of conservation of energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're trying to make a blow-up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I basically engineer a blow-up by changing volts of physics, which is one thing that mathematicians are allowed to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We can change the equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How does that help you get closer to the proof of something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it provides what's called an obstruction in mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I did was that, basically, if I turned off certain parts of the equation, which usually when you turn off certain interactions make it less nonlinear, it makes it more regular and less likely to blow up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I found that by turning off a very well-designed set of interactions, I could force all the energy to blow up in finite time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So what that means is that if you wanted to prove global regularity for Navier-Stokes, for the actual equation, you must use some feature of the true equation, which my artificial equation does not satisfy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So it rules out certain approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So the thing about math is it's not just about taking a technique that is going to work and applying it, but you need to not take the techniques that don't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And for the problems that are really hard, often there are dozens of ways that you might think might apply to solve the problem, but it's only after a lot of experience that you realize there's no way that these methods are going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So having these counter examples for nearby problems kind of rules out, it saves you a lot of time because you're not wasting energy on things that you now know cannot possibly ever work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">How deeply connected is it to that specific problem of fluid dynamics, or is it some more general intuition you build up about mathematics?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So the key phenomenon that my technique exploits is what's called supercriticality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So in partial differential equations, often these equations are like a tug of war between different forces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So in Navier-Stokes, there's the dissipation force coming from viscosity, and it's very well understood, it's linear, it calms things down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If viscosity was all there was, then nothing bad would ever happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's also transport, that energy in one location of space can get transported because the fluid is in motion to other locations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a non-linear effect, and that causes all the problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are these two competing terms in the Navier-Stokes equation, the dissipation term and the transport term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">If the dissipation term dominates, if it's large, then basically you get regularity, and if the transport term dominates, then we don't know what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very non-linear situation, it's unpredictable, it's turbulent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes these forces are in balance at small scales, but not in balance at large scales, or vice versa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So Navier-Stokes is what's called supercritical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So at smaller and smaller scales, the transport terms are much stronger than the viscosity terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the viscosity terms are the things that calm things down, and so this is why the problem is hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">In two dimensions, so the Soviet Methodician Ladyshynskaya, she, in the 60s, showed in two dimensions there was no blow-up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you mentioned, the Navier-Stokes equation is what's called critical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The effect of transport and the effect of viscosity are about the same strength, even at very, very small scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have a lot of technology to handle critical and also subcritical equations and prove regularity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But for supercritical equations, it was not clear what was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I did a lot of work, and then there's been a lot of follow-up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">showing that for many other types of supercritical equations, you can create all kinds of blow-up examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once the non-linear effects dominate the linear effects at small scales,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you can have all kinds of bad things happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is sort of one of the main insights of this line of work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is that supercriticality versus criticality and subcriticality, this makes a big difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's a key qualitative feature that distinguishes some equations for being sort of nice and predictable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and, you know, like planetary motion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's certain equations that you can predict for millions of years, or thousands at least.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, it's not really a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a reason why we can't predict the weather past two weeks into the future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's a supercritical equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Lots of really strange things are going on at very fine scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever there's some huge source of non-linearity that can create a huge problem for predicting what's going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And if non-linearity is somehow more and more featured and interesting at small scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's many equations that are non-linear, but in many equations, you can approximate things by the bulk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, planetary motion, you know, if you wanted to understand the orbit of the Moon or Mars or something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't really need the microstructure of, like, the seismology of the Moon or, like, exactly how the mass is distributed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You just, basically, you can almost approximate these planets by point masses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And just the aggregate behavior is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you want to model a fluid, like the weather, you can't just say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in Los Angeles, the temperature is this, the wind speed is this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">For supercritical equations, the fine scale information is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If we can just linger on the Navier-Stokes equations a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've suggested, maybe you can describe it, that one of the ways to solve it or to negatively resolve it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">would be to sort of to construct a liquid, a kind of liquid computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then show that the halting problem from computation theory has consequences for fluid dynamics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So show it in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1160"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So as part of how I had to do this, so there's sort of this naive way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You just keep

this game of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, they discovered this thing called a glider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.420</a></span> | <span

of what inspired me to propose the same thing with Navier Stokes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1733"

it just shows it's possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's a kind of emergence that happens with these cellular automata.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1750"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But local rules operating at scale can create these incredibly complex dynamic structures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think any of that

target="_blank">00:29:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing is, you can get these emergent, very complicated structures, but only with very carefully prepared initial conditions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So these glider guns and gates and software machines, if you just plunk down randomly some cells and you're looking to the left, you will not see any of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the analogous situation of Navier Stokes again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that with typical initial conditions, you will not have any of this weird computation going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically through engineering, you know, by specially designing things in a very special way, you can make clever constructions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder if it's possible to prove the sort of the negative of like, basically prove that only through engineering can you ever create something interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a recurring challenge in mathematics that I call the dichotomy between structure and randomness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That most objects that you can generate in mathematics are random.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They look like the digits of pi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we believe is a good example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a very small number of things that have patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But now, you can prove something as a pattern by just constructing, you know, like if something has a simple pattern and you have a proof that it does something like repeat itself every so often, you can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can prove that most sequences of digits have no pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So like if you just pick digits randomly, there's something called the low large numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It tells you you're going to get as many ones as twos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">In the long run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1856" target="_blank">00:30:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have a lot fewer tools to, if I give you a specific pattern like the digits of pi, how can I show that this doesn't have some weird pattern to it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Some other work that I spend a lot of time on is to prove what's called structure theorems or inverse theorems that give tests for when something is very structured.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So some functions are what's called additive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you have a function that matters the natural numbers are the natural numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe, you know, two maps to four, three maps to six and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Some functions are what's called additive, which means that if you add two inputs together, the output gets added as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, I multiply by a constant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If you multiply a number by 10, if you multiply a plus b by 10, that's the same as multiplying a by 10 and b by 10 and then adding them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So some functions are additive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Some functions are kind of additive, but not completely additive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if I take a number n, I multiply by the square root of 2 and I take the integer part of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So 10 by square root of 2 is like 14 point something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So 10 up to 14.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">20 up to 28.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So in that case, additivity is true then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So 10 plus 10 is 20 and 14 plus 40 is 28.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But because of this rounding, sometimes there's roundoff errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes when you add a plus b, this function doesn't quite give you the sum of the two individual outputs, but the sum plus minus 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's almost additive, but not quite additive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of useful results in mathematics, and I've worked a lot on developing things like this, to the effect that if a function exhibits some structure like this, then it's basically, there's a reason for why it's true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is because there's some other nearby function, which is actually completely structured, which is explaining this sort of partial pattern that you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you have these inverse theorems, it creates this sort of dichotomy that either the objects that you study are either have no structure at all, or they are somehow related to something that is structured.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And in either way, in either case, you can make progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">A good example of this is that there's this old theorem in mathematics called Zemuretti's theorem, proven in the 1970s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It concerns trying to find a certain type of pattern in a set of numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The pattern is arithmetic progression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Things like 3, 5, and 7, or 10, 15, and 20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And Zemuretti, Zemuretti proved that any set of numbers that are sufficiently big, what's called positive density, has arithmetic progressions in it of any length you wish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, the odd numbers have a set of density 1.5, and they contain arithmetic progressions of any length.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So in that case, it's obvious because the odd numbers are really, really structured.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I can

target="_blank">00:36:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So in more recent years, people have started taking results that are true and infinite limits and what's called finalizing them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you know that something's true eventually, but you don't know when.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.380</a></span> | <span

if I don't have an infinite number of monkeys, but a large finite number of monkeys, how long do I have to wait for Hamlet to come out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a more quantitative question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is something that you can attack by purely finite methods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can use your finite intuition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, it turns out to be exponential in the length of the text that you're trying to generate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is why you never see the monkeys create Hamlet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You can maybe see them create a four-letter word, but nothing that big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I personally find once you finalize an infinite statement, it does become much more intuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's no longer so weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So even if you're working with infinity, it's good to finalize so that you can have some intuition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The downside is that the finalized groups are just much, much messier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the infinite ones are found first, usually, like decades earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then later on, people finalize them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So since we mentioned a lot of math and a lot of physics, what is the difference between mathematics and physics as disciplines, as ways of understanding, of seeing the world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe we can throw in

he did was that he computed, I mean, mostly by himself, but also hired human computers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2525"

off with a model which is actually really far from reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But it fits kind of the observations that you have, you know, so things look good, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But over time, as you make more and more observations, bringing it closer to

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, you can take lots and lots of independent random variables and average

<span class="t">And we can prove in various cases that these bell curves, these calcians emerge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is a satisfying explanation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2983"

universality is not a 100% reliable thing to rely on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.160</a></span> |

proportion of them would default in their mortgages, if everything was decorrelated, it would be a nice bell curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can manage risk with options and derivatives and so forth.</span></div><div

can push everybody to default at the same time, that's very non-Gaussing behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3037"

much bigger issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And just because

| <span class="t">So, the mathematics of working out what models do is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But also, the science of validating when the models fit reality and when they don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But mathematics can help because it can, for example, these central limit theorems, it tells you that if you have certain axioms like non-correlation, that if all the inputs were not correlated to each other, then you have these Gaussian behaviors and things are fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3081" target="_blank">00:51:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It tells you where to look for weaknesses in the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you have a mathematical understanding of central limit theorem and someone proposes to use these Gaussian copulas or whatever to model default risk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you're mathematically trained, you would say, okay, but what is this systemic correlation between all your inputs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.080</a></span> | <span

what we teach, and it's internalized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.500</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Algebra and geometry were separated, and now we have a fluid algebraic geometry that

target="_blank">00:54:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think there's sort of different styles to being a mathematician.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think hedgehogs and foxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

definitely both hedgehogs and foxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3257" target="_blank">00:54:17.420</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there are other mathematicians who are far deeper than I am.</span></div><div

of thinking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Thinking about a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it uses types of mathematics that I'm not super familiar

target="_blank">00:56:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And from that, I can get some understanding of the tools that are used in that field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's very exploratory, doing crazy things in crazy fields and reinventing the

that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's step back and maybe look at a bit of a romanticized version of mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3412" target="_blank">00:56:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think you've said that early on in your life, math was more like a puzzle-solving activity when you were young.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">When did you first encounter a problem or proof where you realized math can have a kind of elegance and beauty to it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3435" target="_blank">00:57:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">When I came to graduate school in Princeton, so John Conway was there at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3440" target="_blank">00:57:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">He passed away a few years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3441" target="_blank">00:57:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I remember one of the very first research talks I went to was a talk by Conway on what he called extreme proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Conway just had this amazing way of thinking about all kinds of things in a way that you wouldn't normally think of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3453" target="_blank">00:57:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he thought of proofs themselves as occupying some sort of space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you want to prove something, let's say that there's infinitely many primes, there are all different proofs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could rank them in different axes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, some proofs are elegant, some proofs are long, some proofs are elementary, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the space of all proofs itself has some sort of shape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, he was interested in extreme points of this shape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3481" target="_blank">00:58:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, out of all these proofs, what is one that is the shortest at the expense of everything else, or the most elementary, or whatever?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3489" target="_blank">00:58:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, he gave some examples of well-known theorems, and then he would give what he thought was the extreme proof in these different aspects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3497" target="_blank">00:58:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I just found that really eye-opening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just getting a proof for a result was interesting, but once you have that proof, trying to optimize it in various ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That proofing itself had some craftsmanship to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3520" target="_blank">00:58:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something for my writing style, that, you know, like when you do your math assignments, and as you undergraduate, your homework, and so forth, you're sort of encouraged to just write down any proof that works, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3530" target="_blank">00:58:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And hand it in, as long as it gets a tick mark, you move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you want your results to actually be influential and be read by people, it can't just be correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3541" target="_blank">00:59:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It should also be a pleasure to read, you know, motivated, be adaptable to generalize to other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3550" target="_blank">00:59:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the same in many other disciplines, like coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of analogies between math and coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3554" target="_blank">00:59:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I like analogies, if you haven't noticed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, like you can code something spaghettico that works for a certain task, and it's quick and dirty and it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3564" target="_blank">00:59:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's lots of good principles for writing code well, so that a little book can use it, build upon it, and so on, and has fewer bugs and whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's similar things with mathematics.</span></div><div

there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And Kama is one of the great

yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Which I also find beautiful and fun, where people use different programming languages to try to write the shortest possible program that accomplishes a particular task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I believe there's even competitions on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3615" target="_blank">01:00:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's also a nice way to stress test not just the sort of the programs, or in this case, the proofs, but also the different languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.880</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you learn a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it may seem like a frivolous exercise, but it can generate all these insights, which, if you didn't have this artificial objective to pursue, you might not see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3642" target="_blank">01:00:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you use the most beautiful or elegant equation in mathematics?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one of the things that people often look to in beauty is the simplicity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3653" target="_blank">01:00:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you look at E equals mc squared, so when a few concepts come together, that's why the Euler identity is often considered the most beautiful equation in mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you find beauty in that one, in the Euler identity?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, as I said, I mean, what I find most appealing is connections between different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if the pi i equals minus one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, people are like, oh, this is all the fundamental constants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3679" target="_blank">01:01:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, that's, I mean, that's cute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3681" target="_blank">01:01:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But to me, so the exponential function was to measure exponential growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the compound interest or decay, anything which is continuously growing, continuously decreasing, growth and decay or dilation or contraction is modeled by the exponential function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3697" target="_blank">01:01:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas pi comes around from circles and rotation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3702" target="_blank">01:01:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to rotate a needle, for example, 100 degrees, you need to rotate by pi radians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And i, complex numbers, represents the swapping between one imaginary axis, so a 90 degree rotation, so a change in direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3713" target="_blank">01:01:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the exponential function represents growth and decay in the direction that you already are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When you stick an i in the exponential, now it's, instead of motion in the same direction as your current position, it's motion as a right angle as your current position, so rotation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, so, if the pi i equals minus one tells you that if you rotate for a time pi, you end up at the other direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it unifies geometry through dilation and exponential growth, or dynamics, through this act of complexification, rotation by i.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it connects together all these tools in mathematics, you know, dynamics, geometry, and complex, and the complex numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They're all considered almost, yeah, they're all next-door neighbors in mathematics, because of this identity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think the thing you mentioned is cute, the collision of notations from these disparate fields, is just a frivolous side effect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3766" target="_blank">01:02:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do you think there is legitimate, like, value in one notation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3770" target="_blank">01:02:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">All our old friends come together in the night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's confirmation that you have the right concepts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3778" target="_blank">01:02:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you first study anything, you have to measure things and give them names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And initially, sometimes, because your model is, again, too far off from reality, you give the wrong things the best names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3791" target="_blank">01:03:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And you only find out later what's really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Physicists can do this sometimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3796" target="_blank">01:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, but it turns out, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, actually, with physics, so E equals mc squared, okay, so one of the big things was the E, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3803" target="_blank">01:03:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when Aristotle first came up with his laws of motion, and then Galileo and Newton and so forth, you know, they saw the things they could measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3812" target="_blank">01:03:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">They could measure mass and acceleration and force and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, Newtonian mechanics, for example, E equals mA was the famous Newton's second law of motion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, those were the primary objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they gave them the central billing in the theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It was only later, after people started analyzing these equations, that there always seemed to be these quantities that were conserved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in particular, momentum and energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not obvious that things happen in energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3837" target="_blank">01:03:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's not something you can directly measure the same way you can measure mass and velocity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But over time, people realized that this was actually a really fundamental concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3845" target="_blank">01:04:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Hamilton, eventually, in the 19th century, reformulated Newton's laws of physics into what's called Hamiltonian mechanics, where the energy, which is now called the Hamiltonian, was the dominant object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3854" target="_blank">01:04:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you know how to measure the Hamiltonian of any system, you can describe completely the dynamics, like what happens to all the states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It really was a central actor, which was not obvious initially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this helped, actually, this change of perspective really helped when quantum mechanics came along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the early physicists who studied quantum mechanics, they had a lot of trouble trying to adapt their Newtonian thinking, because everything was a particle and so forth, to quantum mechanics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Because everything was a wave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3888" target="_blank">01:04:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It just looked really, really weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you ask, what is the quantum vision of E equals mA?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3893" target="_blank">01:04:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really, really hard to give an answer to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3896" target="_blank">01:04:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But it turns out that the Hamiltonian, which was so secretly behind the scenes in classical mechanics, also is the key object in quantum mechanics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also an object called a Hamiltonian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a different type of object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what's called an operator rather than a function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, once you specify it, you specify the entire dynamics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3917" target="_blank">01:05:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's something called Schrodinger's equation that tells you exactly how quantum systems evolve once you have a Hamiltonian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So side by side, they look completely different objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One involves particles, one involves waves, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3929" target="_blank">01:05:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But with this centrality, you could start actually transferring a lot of intuition and facts from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3936" target="_blank">01:05:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, in classical mechanics, there's this thing called Noether's theorem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3940" target="_blank">01:05:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time there's a symmetry in a physical system, there is a conservation law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3943" target="_blank">01:05:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So the laws of physics are translation invariant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3946" target="_blank">01:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if I move 10 steps to the left, I experience the same laws of physics as if I was here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And that corresponds to conservation of momentum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3953" target="_blank">01:05:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If I turn around by some angle, again, I experience the same laws of physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This corresponds to the conservation of angular momentum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If I wait for 10 minutes, I still have the same laws of physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3964" target="_blank">01:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's time translation invariants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This corresponds to the law of conservation of energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's this fundamental connection between symmetry and conservation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3971" target="_blank">01:06:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's also true in quantum mechanics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3974" target="_blank">01:06:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though the equations are completely different, but because they're both coming from the Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian controls everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time the Hamiltonian has a symmetry, the equations will have a conservation law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3984" target="_blank">01:06:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you have the right language, it actually makes things a lot cleaner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the points why we can't unify quantum mechanics and general relativity yet, we haven't figured out what the fundamental objects are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3998" target="_blank">01:06:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, we have to give up the notion of space and time being these almost Euclidean-type spaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4003" target="_blank">01:06:43.380</a></span> | <span

developed Riemannian geometry, which is precisely a theory of spaces that are curved in various general ways, which turned out to be almost exactly what was needed for Einstein's theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4141" target="_blank">01:09:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This is going back to Wigner's

class="t">There's something called the wave maps equation or the sigma field model, which is not quite the equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4418" target="_blank">01:13:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of space-time gravity itself, but of certain fields that might exist on top of space-time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4424" target="_blank">01:13:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So Einstein's equations of relativity just describes space and time itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4429" target="_blank">01:13:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But then there's other fields that live on top of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4432" target="_blank">01:13:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the electromagnetic field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4434" target="_blank">01:13:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There's things called Yang-Mills fields.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4435" target="_blank">01:13:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's this whole hierarchy of different equations, of which Einstein is considered one of the most nonlinear and difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4441" target="_blank">01:14:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But relatively low on the hierarchy was this thing called the wave maps equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a wave which at any given point is fixed to be like on a sphere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can think of a bunch of arrows in space and time, and yeah, so it's pointing in different directions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4457" target="_blank">01:14:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But they propagate like waves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4460" target="_blank">01:14:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you wiggle an arrow, it will propagate and make all the arrows move kind of like sheaves of wheat in the wheat field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4467" target="_blank">01:14:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was interested in the global reality problem again for this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, is it possible for all the energy here to collect at a point?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4474" target="_blank">01:14:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the equation I considered was actually what's called a critical equation, where it's actually the behavior at all scales is roughly the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4481" target="_blank">01:14:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was able barely to show that you couldn't actually force a scenario where all the energy concentrated at one point, that the energy had to disperse a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4490" target="_blank">01:14:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And the moment it disperse a little bit, it would stay regular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4493" target="_blank">01:14:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this was back in 2000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4495" target="_blank">01:14:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That was part of why I got interested in Nari-Sogs afterwards, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4498" target="_blank">01:14:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I developed some techniques to solve that problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4502" target="_blank">01:15:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So part of it is this problem is really nonlinear because of the curvature of the sphere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4508" target="_blank">01:15:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a certain nonlinear effect, which was a non-perturbative effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4512" target="_blank">01:15:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It was when you sort of looked at it normally, it looked larger than the linear effects of the wave equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4517" target="_blank">01:15:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was hard to keep things under control, even when the energy was small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4523" target="_blank">01:15:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But I developed what's called a gauge transformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4525" target="_blank">01:15:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the equation is kind of like an evolution of sheaves of wheat, and they're all bending back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4531" target="_blank">01:15:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a lot of motion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4532" target="_blank">01:15:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you imagine stabilizing the flow by attaching little cameras at different points in space,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4538" target="_blank">01:15:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which are trying to move in a way that captures most of the motion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4541" target="_blank">01:15:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And under this sort of stabilized flow, the flow becomes a lot more linear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4545" target="_blank">01:15:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I discovered a way to transform the equation to reduce the amount of nonlinear effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4552" target="_blank">01:15:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I was able to solve the equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4555" target="_blank">01:15:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I found this transformation while visiting my aunt in Australia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4559" target="_blank">01:15:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was trying to understand the dynamics of all these fields, and I couldn't do it with pen and paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4564" target="_blank">01:16:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had none of the facility of computers to do any computer simulations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4567" target="_blank">01:16:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I ended up closing my eyes, being on the floor, and just imagining myself to actually be the specter field,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4574" target="_blank">01:16:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and rolling around to try to see how to change coordinates in such a way that somehow things in all directions would behave in a reasonably linear fashion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4582" target="_blank">01:16:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, my aunt walked in on me while I was doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4585" target="_blank">01:16:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And she was asking, what am I doing, doing this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4587" target="_blank">01:16:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's complicated, is the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4589" target="_blank">01:16:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div

problems?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's possible to go inside your mind when you're thinking, are you visualizing in your mind the mathematical objects, symbols maybe?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4613" target="_blank">01:16:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">What are you visualizing in your mind usually when you're thinking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4617" target="_blank">01:16:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of pen and paper.</span></div><div

call it cheating strategically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4622" target="_blank">01:17:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the beauty of mathematics is that you get to change the rule, change the problem, change the rules as you wish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't get to do this for any other field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4633" target="_blank">01:17:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, if you're an engineer and someone says, build a bridge over this river, you can't say, I want to build this bridge over here instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4639"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4641" target="_blank">01:17:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But a mathematician, you can do whatever you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4646" target="_blank">01:17:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like trying to solve a computer game where you can, there's unlimited cheat codes available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4651" target="_blank">01:17:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, you can set this, there's a dimension that's too large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4657" target="_blank">01:17:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll set it to one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4658"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4659" target="_blank">01:17:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a main term and an error term.</span></div><div class="c"><span

in sort of this Iron Man mode where you make things maximally difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, the way you should approach any reasonable math problem is that if there are 10 things that are making it difficult, find a version of the problem that turns off nine of the difficulties but only keeps one of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4683"

the 10 problems, 10 difficulties separately, then you have to start merging them a few at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:19:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm beginning to use more and more computers, partly because AI makes it much easier to do simple coding things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4780" target="_blank">01:19:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That, you know, if I wanted to plot a function before, which is moderately complicated as an iteration or something, you know, I'd have to remember how to set up a Python program and how does a for loop work and debug it and it would take two hours and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4793" target="_blank">01:19:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I can do it in 10, 15 minutes, as much, yeah, I'm using more and more computers to do simple explorations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4800" target="_blank">01:20:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about AI a little bit, if we could.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4804" target="_blank">01:20:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, maybe a good entry point is just talking about computer-assisted proofs in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4809" target="_blank">01:20:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you describe the Lean formal proof programming language and how it can help as a proof assistant and maybe how you started using it and how it has helped you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4825" target="_blank">01:20:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Lean is a computer language, much like sort of standard languages like Python and C and so forth, except that in most languages, the focus is on producing executable code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4836" target="_blank">01:20:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Lines of code do things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4838" target="_blank">01:20:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they flip bits or they make a robot move or they deliver you text on the internet or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4844" target="_blank">01:20:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Lean is a language that can also do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4847" target="_blank">01:20:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It can also be run as a standard traditional language, but it can also produce certificates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4852" target="_blank">01:20:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a software language like Python might do a computation and give you that the answer is 7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4856" target="_blank">01:20:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, that idea does the sum of 3 plus 4 is equal to 7, but Lean can produce not just the answer, but a proof that how it got the answer of 7 as 3 plus 4 and all the steps involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4869" target="_blank">01:21:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it creates these more complicated objects, not just statements, but statements with proofs attached to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4875" target="_blank">01:21:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And every line of code is just a way of piecing together previous statements to create new ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4881" target="_blank">01:21:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the idea is not new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4883" target="_blank">01:21:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">These things are called proof assistants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4885" target="_blank">01:21:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, they provide languages for which you can create quite complicated, intricate mathematical proofs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4891" target="_blank">01:21:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And they produce these certificates that give a 100% guarantee that your arguments are correct if you trust the compiler of Lean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4899" target="_blank">01:21:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But they made the compiler really small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4901" target="_blank">01:21:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can, there are several different compilers available for the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4904" target="_blank">01:21:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you give people some intuition about the difference between writing on pen and paper versus using Lean programming language?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4912" target="_blank">01:21:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">How hard is it to formalize a statement?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4916" target="_blank">01:21:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Lean, a lot of mathematicians were involved in the design of Lean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4919" target="_blank">01:21:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's designed so that individual lines of code resemble individual lines of mathematical argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4926" target="_blank">01:22:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you might want to introduce a variable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4927" target="_blank">01:22:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You might want to prove a contradiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4929" target="_blank">01:22:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There are various standard things that you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4932" target="_blank">01:22:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's written so that ideally it should have a one-to-one correspondence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4936" target="_blank">01:22:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">In practice, it isn't because Lean is like explaining a proof to an extremely pedantic colleague who will point out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4944" target="_blank">01:22:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, did you really mean this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4945" target="_blank">01:22:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what happens if this is zero?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4946" target="_blank">01:22:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, how do you justify this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4948" target="_blank">01:22:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Lean has a lot of automation in it to try to be less annoying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4955" target="_blank">01:22:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, every mathematical object has to come with a type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4959" target="_blank">01:22:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if I talk about x, is x a real number or a natural number or a function or something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4966" target="_blank">01:22:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If you write things informally, it's often in some context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4971" target="_blank">01:22:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You say, you know, clearly x is equal to, let x be the sum of y and z, and y and z were already real numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4977" target="_blank">01:22:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, x should also be a real number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4979" target="_blank">01:22:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Lean can do a lot of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4981" target="_blank">01:23:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But every so often, it says, wait a minute, can you tell me more about what this object is, what type of object it is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4987" target="_blank">01:23:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to think more at a philosophical level, not just sort of computations that you're doing, but sort of what each object actually is, in some sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4997" target="_blank">01:23:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it using something like LLMs to do the type inference or like you mentioned with a real number?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5003" target="_blank">01:23:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's using much more traditional, what's called good old-fashioned AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5006" target="_blank">01:23:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You can represent all these things as trees, and there's always algorithms to match one tree to another tree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5010" target="_blank">01:23:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's actually doable to figure out if something is a real number or a natural number?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5016" target="_blank">01:23:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, every object sort of comes with a history of where it came from, and you can kind of trace it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5020" target="_blank">01:23:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5020" target="_blank">01:23:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so it's designed for reliability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5023" target="_blank">01:23:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, modern AIs are not used in, it's a disjoint technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5028" target="_blank">01:23:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">People are beginning to use AIs on top of Lean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5030" target="_blank">01:23:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when a mathematician tries to program a proof in Lean, often there's a step, okay, now I want to use the fundamental thing with calculus, say, okay, to do the next step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5040" target="_blank">01:24:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the Lean developers have built this massive project called Metholib, a collection of tens of thousands of useful facts about methodical objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5048" target="_blank">01:24:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And somewhere in there is the fundamental thing with calculus, but you need to find it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5053" target="_blank">01:24:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a lot of the bottleneck now is actually lemma search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5055" target="_blank">01:24:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's a tool that you know is in there somewhere, and you need to find it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5060" target="_blank">01:24:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, there are various search engines specialized for Metholib that you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5064" target="_blank">01:24:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's now these large language models that you can say, I need the fundamental thing with calculus at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5070" target="_blank">01:24:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, okay, for example, when I code, I have GitHub Copilot installed as a plugin to my IDE.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5077" target="_blank">01:24:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it scans my text, and it sees what I need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5080" target="_blank">01:24:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, you know, I might even type, okay, now I need to use the fundamental thing with calculus, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5084" target="_blank">01:24:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it might suggest, okay, try this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5086" target="_blank">01:24:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, maybe 25% of the time, it works exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5088" target="_blank">01:24:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then another 10-50% of the time, it doesn't quite work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5092" target="_blank">01:24:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's close enough that I can say, oh, yeah, if I just change it here and here, it will work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5095" target="_blank">01:24:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, like, half the time, it gives me complete rubbish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5099" target="_blank">01:24:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but people are beginning to use AIs a little bit on top, mostly on the level of, basically, fancy autocomplete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5106" target="_blank">01:25:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That you can type half of one line of a proof, and it will find, it will tell you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5111" target="_blank">01:25:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but a fancy, especially fancy with a sort of capital letter F, removes some of the friction a mathematician might feel when they move from pen and paper to formalizing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5123" target="_blank">01:25:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5124" target="_blank">01:25:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, right now, I estimate that the effort, time and effort taken to formalize a proof is about 10 times the amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5129" target="_blank">01:25:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">They can do, to write it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5130" target="_blank">01:25:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, it's doable, but you don't, it's, it's annoying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5135" target="_blank">01:25:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But doesn't it, like, kill the whole vibe of being a mathematician?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5138" target="_blank">01:25:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5139" target="_blank">01:25:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Just having a pedantic co-worker?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5141" target="_blank">01:25:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5142" target="_blank">01:25:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, if that was the only aspect of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5144" target="_blank">01:25:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5144" target="_blank">01:25:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5146" target="_blank">01:25:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some, there's some cases where it's actually more pleasant to do things formally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5149" target="_blank">01:25:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's a theorem I formalized, and there's a certain constant 12 that came out in the final statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5156" target="_blank">01:25:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this 12 had to be carried all through the proof, and, like, everything had to be checked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5160" target="_blank">01:26:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That it goes, all the, all these other numbers that had to be consistent with this final number 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5164" target="_blank">01:26:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, so, we wrote a paper through this theorem with this number 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5168" target="_blank">01:26:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, a few weeks later, someone said, oh, we can actually improve this 12 to an 11 by reworking some of these steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5173" target="_blank">01:26:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And, when this happens with pen and paper, like, every time you change your parameter, you have to check line by line that every single line of your proof still works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5180" target="_blank">01:26:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And, there can be subtle things that you didn't quite realize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5182" target="_blank">01:26:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some properties on the number 12 that you didn't even realize that you were taking advantage of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5186" target="_blank">01:26:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a proof can break down at a subtle place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5188" target="_blank">01:26:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we had formalized the proof with this constant 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5191" target="_blank">01:26:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, when this new paper came out, we said, oh, let's, so, that took, like, three weeks to formalize, and, like, 20 people to formalize this original proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5200" target="_blank">01:26:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, oh, but now let's, let's, let's update the 12 to 11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5205" target="_blank">01:26:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And, what you can do with lean, so, you just, in your headline theorem, you change your 12 to 11, you run the compiler, and, like, of the thousands of lines of code you have, 90% of them still work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5215" target="_blank">01:26:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And, there's a couple that are lined in red.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5217" target="_blank">01:26:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I can't justify these steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5218" target="_blank">01:26:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But, it immediately isolates which steps you need to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5221" target="_blank">01:27:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you can skip over everything which works just fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5223" target="_blank">01:27:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And, if you program things correctly, with, sort of, good programming practices, most of your lines will not be read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5230" target="_blank">01:27:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, there'll just be a few places where you, I mean, if you don't hardcode your constants, but you, sort of, you use smart tactics and so forth, you can localize the things you need to change to a very small period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5244" target="_blank">01:27:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's, like, within a day or two, we had updated our proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5247" target="_blank">01:27:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, this is a very quick process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5249" target="_blank">01:27:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You make a change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5251" target="_blank">01:27:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There are 10 things now that don't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5252" target="_blank">01:27:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">For each one, you make a change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5254" target="_blank">01:27:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And, now, there's five more things that don't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5255" target="_blank">01:27:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But, the process converges much more smoothly than with pen and paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5260" target="_blank">01:27:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's for writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5261" target="_blank">01:27:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you able to read it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5262" target="_blank">01:27:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if somebody else sends a proof, are you able to, like, how, what's the, versus paper?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5267" target="_blank">01:27:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5268" target="_blank">01:27:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the proofs are longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5269" target="_blank">01:27:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But, each individual piece is easier to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5273" target="_blank">01:27:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you take a math paper and you jump to page 27 and you look at paragraph 6 and you have a line of text of math, I often can't read it immediately because it assumes various definitions, which I had to go back and maybe on 10 pages earlier this was defined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5289" target="_blank">01:28:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And, the proof is scattered all over the place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5292" target="_blank">01:28:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you basically are forced to read fairly sequentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5294" target="_blank">01:28:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like, say, a novel where, like, you know, in a theory you could open up a novel halfway through and start reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5300" target="_blank">01:28:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5302" target="_blank">01:28:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But, when a proof in Lean, if you put your cursor on a line of code, every single object there, you can hover over it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5307" target="_blank">01:28:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, it will say what it is, where it came from, where the sub is justified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5311" target="_blank">01:28:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You can trace things back much easier than sort of flipping through a math paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5314" target="_blank">01:28:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one thing that Lean really enables is actually collaborating on proofs at a really atomic scale that you really couldn't do in the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5321" target="_blank">01:28:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, traditionally, with pen and paper, when you want to collaborate with another mathematician, either you do it at a blackboard where you can really interact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5330" target="_blank">01:28:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But, if you're doing it sort of by email or something, basically, yeah, you have to segment it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5334" target="_blank">01:28:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Say, I'm going to finish section three, you do section four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5337" target="_blank">01:28:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you can't really sort of work on the same thing, collaborate at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5342" target="_blank">01:29:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But, with Lean, you can be trying to formalize some portion of the proof and say, I got stuck at line 67 here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5348" target="_blank">01:29:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to prove this thing, but it doesn't quite work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5350" target="_blank">01:29:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the three lines of code I'm having trouble with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5352" target="_blank">01:29:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But, because all the context is there, someone else can say, oh, okay, I recognize what you need to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5357" target="_blank">01:29:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to apply this trick or this tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5359" target="_blank">01:29:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you can do extremely atomic level conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5362" target="_blank">01:29:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, because of Lean, I can collaborate with dozens of people across the world, most of whom I have never met in person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5369" target="_blank">01:29:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I may not know, actually, even whether they're, how reliable they are in the proof they give me, but Lean gives me a certificate of trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5380" target="_blank">01:29:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I can do, I can do, I can do trustless mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5382" target="_blank">01:29:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's so many interesting questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5384" target="_blank">01:29:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, so one, you're, you're known for being a great collaborator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5389" target="_blank">01:29:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what is the right way to approach solving a difficult problem in mathematics when you're collaborating?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5397" target="_blank">01:29:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you doing a divide and conquer type of thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5400" target="_blank">01:30:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, are you brain, are you focused on a particular part and you're brainstorming?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5405" target="_blank">01:30:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There's always a brainstorming process first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5408" target="_blank">01:30:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, math research projects, sort of, by their nature, when you start, you don't really know how to do the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5413" target="_blank">01:30:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like an engineering project where somehow the theory has been established for decades and its implementation is the main difficulty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5420" target="_blank">01:30:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to figure out even what is the right path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5423" target="_blank">01:30:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is what I said about cheating first, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5425" target="_blank">01:30:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, to go back to the bridge building analogy, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5430" target="_blank">01:30:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">First, assume you have an infinite budget and, like, unlimited amounts of workforce and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5434" target="_blank">01:30:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, can you, can you build this bridge?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5436" target="_blank">01:30:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5436" target="_blank">01:30:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, have an infinite budget but only finite workforce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5439" target="_blank">01:30:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, now can you do that and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5440" target="_blank">01:30:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, of course, no, no engineer can actually do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5445" target="_blank">01:30:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, they have fixed requirements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5447" target="_blank">01:30:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, there's this sort of jam sessions always at the beginning where you try all kinds of crazy things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5452" target="_blank">01:30:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and you, you make all these assumptions that are unrealistic but you plan to fix later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5456" target="_blank">01:30:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And you try to see if there's even some skeleton of an approach that might work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5461" target="_blank">01:31:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, hopefully, that breaks up the problem into smaller sub-problems which you don't know how to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5467" target="_blank">01:31:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but then you, you focus on the sub-ones and sometimes different collaborators are better at working on certain things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5474" target="_blank">01:31:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one of my themes I'm known for is a theme of Ben Green, which is now called the Green Tower Theorem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5479" target="_blank">01:31:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a statement that the primes contain arithmetic progressions of any of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5483" target="_blank">01:31:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it was a modification of this theorem as I'm ready.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5486" target="_blank">01:31:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way we collaborated was that Ben had already proven a similar result for progressions of length 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5491" target="_blank">01:31:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">He showed that sets like the primes contain lots and lots of progressions of length 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5495" target="_blank">01:31:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And even subsets of the primes, certain subsets do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5499" target="_blank">01:31:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But his techniques only worked for length 3 progressions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5504" target="_blank">01:31:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't work for longer progressions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5506" target="_blank">01:31:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But I had these techniques coming from a gothic theory, which is something that I had been playing with and I knew better than Ben at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5512" target="_blank">01:31:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, if I could justify certain randomness properties of some set relating to the primes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5519" target="_blank">01:31:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a certain technical condition, which if I could have it, if Ben could supply me this fact, I could conclude the theorem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5526" target="_blank">01:32:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I asked was a really difficult question in number theory, which he said, there's no way we can prove this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5534" target="_blank">01:32:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he said, can you prove your part of the theorem using a weaker hypothesis that I have a chance to prove it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5538" target="_blank">01:32:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And he proposed something which he could prove, but it was too weak for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5542" target="_blank">01:32:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, I can't use this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5543" target="_blank">01:32:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there was this conversation going back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5548" target="_blank">01:32:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Different cheats, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5549" target="_blank">01:32:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5550" target="_blank">01:32:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to cheat more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5551" target="_blank">01:32:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">He wants to cheat less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5552" target="_blank">01:32:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But eventually, we found a property which, A, he could prove, and B, I could use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5557" target="_blank">01:32:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we could prove our theorem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5559" target="_blank">01:32:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, there's all kinds of dynamics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5564" target="_blank">01:32:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, every collaboration has some story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5569" target="_blank">01:32:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">No two are the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5570" target="_blank">01:32:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, on the flip side of that, like you mentioned, with Lean programming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5574" target="_blank">01:32:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's almost like a different story because you can do, you can create, I think you've mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5580" target="_blank">01:33:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a kind of a blueprint for a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5584" target="_blank">01:33:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you can really do a divide and conquer with Lean, where you're working on separate parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5590" target="_blank">01:33:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5591" target="_blank">01:33:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're using the computer system proof checker, essentially, to make sure that everything is correct along the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5596" target="_blank">01:33:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, it makes everything compatible and, yeah, and trustable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5600" target="_blank">01:33:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, currently, only a few mathematical projects can be cut up in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5605" target="_blank">01:33:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">At the current state of the art, most of the Lean activity is on formalizing proofs that have already been proven by humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5610" target="_blank">01:33:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">A math paper basically is a blueprint, in a sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5615" target="_blank">01:33:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It is taking a difficult statement, like a big theorem, and breaking it up into maybe a hundred little numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5621" target="_blank">01:33:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But often, not all written with enough detail that each one can be sort of directly formalized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5626" target="_blank">01:33:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">A blueprint is like a really pedantically written version of a paper where every step is explained as much detail as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5635" target="_blank">01:33:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're trying to make each step kind of self-contained, or depending on only a very specific number of previous statements that have been proven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5642" target="_blank">01:34:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that each node of this blueprint graph that gets generated can be tackled independently of all the others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5648" target="_blank">01:34:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't even need to know how the whole thing works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5651" target="_blank">01:34:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's like a modern supply chain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5653" target="_blank">01:34:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like if you want to create an iPhone or some other complicated object, no one person can build a single object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5660" target="_blank">01:34:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can have specialists who just, if they're given some widgets from some other company, they can combine them together to form a slightly bigger widget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5667" target="_blank">01:34:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's a really exciting possibility, because you can have, if you can find problems that could be broken down this way, then you can have, you know, thousands of contributors, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5677" target="_blank">01:34:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, yes, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5678" target="_blank">01:34:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I told you before about the split between theoretical and experimental mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5682" target="_blank">01:34:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And right now, most mathematics is theoretical, and only a tiny bit is experimental.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5686" target="_blank">01:34:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the platform that Lean and other software tools, so GitHub and things like that, allow experimental mathematics to scale up to a much greater degree than we can do now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5698" target="_blank">01:34:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, right now, if you want to do any mathematical exploration of some mathematical pattern or something, you need some code to write out the pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5707" target="_blank">01:35:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I mean, sometimes there are some computer algebra packages that help, but often it's just one mathematician coding lots and lots of Python or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5715" target="_blank">01:35:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And because coding is such an error-prone activity, it's not practical to allow other people to collaborate with you on writing modules for your code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5722" target="_blank">01:35:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if one of the modules has a bug in it, the whole thing is unreliable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5726" target="_blank">01:35:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you get these bespoke spaghetti code written by non-professional programmers, mathematicians, and they're clunky and slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5738" target="_blank">01:35:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, because of that, it's hard to really mass-produce experimental results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5744" target="_blank">01:35:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, but I think with Lean, I mean, so I'm already starting some projects where we are not just experimenting with data, but experimenting with proofs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5754" target="_blank">01:35:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I have this project called the Equational Theories Project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5756" target="_blank">01:35:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, we generated about 22 million little problems in abstract algebra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5760" target="_blank">01:36:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I should back up and tell you what the project is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5762" target="_blank">01:36:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so abstract algebra studies operations like multiplication and addition and their abstract properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5768" target="_blank">01:36:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so multiplication, for example, is commutative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5770" target="_blank">01:36:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">X times Y is always Y times X, at least for numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5772" target="_blank">01:36:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's also associative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5775" target="_blank">01:36:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">X times Y times Z is the same as X times Y times Z.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5778" target="_blank">01:36:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, these operations obey some laws that don't obey others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5783" target="_blank">01:36:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, X times X is not always equal to X.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5785" target="_blank">01:36:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that law is not always true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5787" target="_blank">01:36:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, given any operation, it obeys some laws and not others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5792" target="_blank">01:36:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we generated about 4,000 of these possible laws of algebra that certain operations can satisfy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5797" target="_blank">01:36:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And our question is, which laws imply which other ones?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5799" target="_blank">01:36:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, does commutativity imply associativity?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5804" target="_blank">01:36:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And the answer is no, because it turns out you can describe an operation which obeys the commutative law, but doesn't obey the associative law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5809" target="_blank">01:36:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, by producing an example, you can show that commutativity does not imply associativity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5814" target="_blank">01:36:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But some other laws do imply other laws by substitution and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5817" target="_blank">01:36:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can write down some algebraic proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5819" target="_blank">01:36:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we look at all the pairs between these 4,000 laws, and there's over 22 million of these pairs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5824" target="_blank">01:37:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And for each pair, we ask, does this law imply this law?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5828" target="_blank">01:37:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If so, give a proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5830" target="_blank">01:37:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">If not, give a counterexample.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5833" target="_blank">01:37:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, 22 million problems, each one of which you could give to an undergraduate algebra student, and they had a decent chance of solving the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5840" target="_blank">01:37:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Although, there are a few, at least 22 million, there are like 100 or so that are really quite hard, but a lot are easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5845" target="_blank">01:37:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the project was just to work out, to determine the entire graph, like which ones imply which other ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5851" target="_blank">01:37:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That's an incredible project, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5852" target="_blank">01:37:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Such a good idea, such a good test of the very thing we've been talking about on a scale that's remarkable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5857" target="_blank">01:37:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so it would not have been feasible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5859" target="_blank">01:37:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the state of the art in the literature was like, you know, 15 equations and sort of how they imply that's sort of at the limit of what a human with pen and paper can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5867" target="_blank">01:37:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you need to scale it up, so you need to crowdsource, but you also need to trust all the, I mean, no one person can check 22 million of these proofs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5877" target="_blank">01:37:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You need it to be computerized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5879" target="_blank">01:37:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it only became possible with Lean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5882" target="_blank">01:38:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We were hoping to use a lot of AI as well, so the project is almost complete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5887" target="_blank">01:38:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all of these 22 million, all but two had been settled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5890" target="_blank">01:38:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5891" target="_blank">01:38:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And, well, actually, and of those two, we have a pen and paper proof of the two, and we're formalizing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5897" target="_blank">01:38:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, this morning, I was working on finishing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5900" target="_blank">01:38:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're almost done on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5902" target="_blank">01:38:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5913" target="_blank">01:38:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're going to have a paper with 50 authors and a big appendix of who contributed to what.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5917" target="_blank">01:38:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's an interesting question, not to maybe speak even more generally about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5922" target="_blank">01:38:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">When you have this pool of people, is there a way to organize the contributions by level of expertise of the people, of the contributors?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5931" target="_blank">01:38:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, okay, I'm asking a lot of pothead questions here, but I'm imagining a bunch of humans, and maybe in the future, some AIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5939" target="_blank">01:38:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Can there be like an ELO rating type of situation where, like a gamification of this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5947" target="_blank">01:39:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The beauty of these lean

<span class="t">So, like everything's uploaded to this GitHub, and GitHub tracks who contributed to what.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5954" target="_blank">01:39:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you could generate statistics at any later point in time.</span></div><div

lines of code, or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5963" target="_blank">01:39:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, these are very crude metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5965" target="_blank">01:39:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I would definitely not want this to become like, you know, part of your tenure review or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5970" target="_blank">01:39:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, I mean, I think already in enterprise computing, right, people do use some of these metrics as part of the assessment of performance of an employee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5981" target="_blank">01:39:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this is a direction which is a bit scary for academics to go down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5985" target="_blank">01:39:45.920</a></span>

true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5998" target="_blank">01:39:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's true that,

metric while flawed is going in the more in the right direction, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6005"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6008" target="_blank">01:40:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think it's interesting to study.</span></div><div class="c"><span

predictors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6014" target="_blank">01:40:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There's this problem called Goodhart's Law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6016" target="_blank">01:40:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If a statistic is actually used to incentivize performance, it becomes gamed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6020" target="_blank">01:40:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it is no longer a useful measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6022" target="_blank">01:40:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6023" target="_blank">01:40:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Always gaming these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6024" target="_blank">01:40:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6024" target="_blank">01:40:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's rational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6026" target="_blank">01:40:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we've done for this project is self-report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6029" target="_blank">01:40:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are actually standard categories from the sciences of what types of contributions people give.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6035" target="_blank">01:40:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's this concept and validation and resources and coding and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6040" target="_blank">01:40:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a standard list of trolls or categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6043" target="_blank">01:40:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just ask each contributor to this big matrix of all the authors and all the categories just to tick the boxes where they think that they contributed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6052" target="_blank">01:40:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And just give a rough idea, you know, like, oh, so you did some coding and you provided some compute, but you didn't do any of the pen and paper verification or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6061" target="_blank">01:41:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that that works out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6064" target="_blank">01:41:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Traditionally, mathematicians just order alphabetically by surname.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6066" target="_blank">01:41:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't have this tradition as in the sciences of, you know, lead author and second author and so forth, which we're proud of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6073" target="_blank">01:41:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we make all the authors equal status, but it doesn't quite scale to this size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6078" target="_blank">01:41:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So a decade ago, I was involved in these things called polymath projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6081" target="_blank">01:41:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the crowdsourcing mathematics, but without the lean component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6085" target="_blank">01:41:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was limited by you needed a human moderator to actually check that all the contributions coming in were actually rather.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6090" target="_blank">01:41:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was a huge bottleneck, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6093" target="_blank">01:41:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but still we had projects that were, you know, 10 authors or so, but we had decided at the time, um, not to try to decide who did what, um, but to have a single pseudonym.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6105" target="_blank">01:41:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we created this fictional character called DHJ polymath in the spirit of Borbaki, Borbaki is the pseudonym for a famous group of mathematicians of the 20th century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6116" target="_blank">01:41:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But, um, and so the paper was authored on the pseudonym.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6118" target="_blank">01:41:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So none of us got the author credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6120" target="_blank">01:42:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, this actually turned out to be not so great for a couple of reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6124" target="_blank">01:42:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so one is that if you actually wanted to be considered for tenure or whatever, you could not use this paper in your, uh, uh, as you're submitted as one of your publications because it was, you didn't have the formal author credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6137" target="_blank">01:42:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, um, um, but the other thing that we've recognized much later is that when people referred to these projects, they naturally refer to the most famous person who was involved in the project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6148" target="_blank">01:42:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah, so this was Tim Gower's project, this was Thomas Towers project and not mentioned the, the other 19 or whatever people that were involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6157" target="_blank">01:42:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're trying something different this time around where we have, everyone's an author, um, but we will have an appendix with this matrix and we'll see how that works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6165" target="_blank">01:42:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, uh, so both projects are incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6167" target="_blank">01:42:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Just the fact that you're involved in such huge collaborations, but I think I saw a talk from Kevin Buzzard about, uh, the lean programming languages a few years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6175" target="_blank">01:42:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're saying that, uh, this might be the future of mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6179" target="_blank">01:42:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's also exciting that you're embracing, uh, one of the greatest mathematicians in the world, embracing this, what seems like the paving of the future of mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6191" target="_blank">01:43:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so I have to ask you here about the integration of AI into this whole process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6199" target="_blank">01:43:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So DeepMind's alpha proof was trained using reinforcement learning on both failed and successful formal lean proofs of IMO problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6208" target="_blank">01:43:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is sort of high level, high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6211" target="_blank">01:43:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, very high level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6212" target="_blank">01:43:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6213" target="_blank">01:43:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Very high level, high school level mathematics problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6215" target="_blank">01:43:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think about the system?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6217" target="_blank">01:43:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe what is the gap between this system that is able to prove the high school level problems versus gradual level, uh, problems?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6226" target="_blank">01:43:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6227" target="_blank">01:43:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the difficulty increases exponentially with the, the number of steps involved in the proof is a commentorial explosion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6233" target="_blank">01:43:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So the thing of large language models is, is that they make mistakes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6237" target="_blank">01:43:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if your proof has got 20 steps and your, uh, has a 10% failure rate, um, at each step, um, of, of going in the wrong direction, like, uh, it's, it's extremely unlikely to actually, uh, reach the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6249" target="_blank">01:44:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, uh, just to take a small tangent here is how hard is the problem of mapping from natural language to the formal program?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6259" target="_blank">01:44:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6259" target="_blank">01:44:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's extremely hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6260" target="_blank">01:44:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, um, natural language, you know, it's very fault tolerant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6263" target="_blank">01:44:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like you can make a few minor grammatical errors and a speaker in the second language can get some idea of what you're saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6268" target="_blank">01:44:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, but, but formal language, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:51:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so the sense of smell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6666" target="_blank">01:51:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, there you go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6667" target="_blank">01:51:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one thing that humans have, and there's a metaphorical, mathematical smell that it's not clear how to get the AI to duplicate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6679" target="_blank">01:51:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, so the way AlphaZero and so forth, they make progress on Go and chess and so forth, is in some sense, they have developed a sense of smell for Go and chess positions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6689" target="_blank">01:51:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That this position is good for white, that's good for black.</span></div><div

smell lets them strategize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6699" target="_blank">01:51:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if AIs gain that ability to sort of a sense of viability of certain proof strategies, so you can say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6706" target="_blank">01:51:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to try to break up this problem into two small subtasks, and they can say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6711" target="_blank">01:51:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, this looks good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6712" target="_blank">01:51:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The two tasks look like they're simpler tasks than your main task, and they've still got a good chance of being true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6717" target="_blank">01:51:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is good to try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6719" target="_blank">01:51:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, no, you've made the problem worse, because each of the two subproblems is actually harder than your original problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6724" target="_blank">01:52:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is actually what normally happens if you try a random thing to try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6728" target="_blank">01:52:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Normally, it's very easy to transform a problem into an even harder problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6731" target="_blank">01:52:11.580</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:52:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if they can pick up a sense of smell, then they could maybe start competing with human-level mathematicians.</span></div><div

collaborating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6747" target="_blank">01:52:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

because it's a paradigm that it's not, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6800" target="_blank">01:53:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We have not had, in the past, assistants that are competent enough to understand complex instructions that can work at massive scale, but are also unreliable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6809" target="_blank">01:53:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an interesting, but a bit unreliable in subtle ways, whereas providing sufficiently good output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6817" target="_blank">01:53:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an interesting combination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6819" target="_blank">01:53:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I mean, you have graduate students that you work with who are kind of like this, but not at scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6827" target="_blank">01:53:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and we had previous software tools that can work at scale, but very narrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6832" target="_blank">01:53:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have to figure out how to use, I mean, so Tim Goward, actually, you mentioned, he actually foresaw, like in 2000, he was envisioning what mathematics would look like in actually two and a half decades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6848" target="_blank">01:54:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, he wrote in his article, like a hypothetical conversation between a mathematical assistant of the future and himself, you know, trying to solve a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6858" target="_blank">01:54:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they would have a conversation that sometimes the human would propose an idea and the AI would evaluate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6865" target="_blank">01:54:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes the AI would propose an idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6868" target="_blank">01:54:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes a competition was required and AI would just go and say, okay, I've checked the 100 cases needed here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6873" target="_blank">01:54:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Or the first, you said this is true for all N, I've checked N up to 100 and it looks good so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6880" target="_blank">01:54:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Or hang on, there's a problem at N equals 46.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6883" target="_blank">01:54:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so just a free form conversation where you don't know in advance where things are going to go, but just based on, I think ideas could be proposed on both sides, calculations could be proposed on both sides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6893" target="_blank">01:54:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had conversations with AI where I say, okay, we're going to collaborate to solve this math problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6898" target="_blank">01:54:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a problem that I already know a solution to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6900" target="_blank">01:55:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I try to prompt it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6901" target="_blank">01:55:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so here's the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6902" target="_blank">01:55:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I suggest using this tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6903" target="_blank">01:55:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll find this lovely argument using a completely different tool, which eventually goes into the weeds and say, no, no, no, try using this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6910" target="_blank">01:55:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, and it might start using this and then it'll go back to the tool that I wanted to do before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6914" target="_blank">01:55:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to keep railroading it onto the path you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6918" target="_blank">01:55:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I could eventually force it to give the proof I wanted, but it was like herding cats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6925" target="_blank">01:55:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And the amount of personal effort I had to take to not just sort of prompt it, but also check its output, because a lot of what it looks like is going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6932" target="_blank">01:55:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there's a problem on 9-17, and basically arguing with it, it was more exhausting than doing it unassisted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6941" target="_blank">01:55:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's the current state of the art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6943" target="_blank">01:55:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder if there's a phase shift that happens to where it no longer feels like herding cats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6950" target="_blank">01:55:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe you'll surprise us how quickly that comes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6954" target="_blank">01:55:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6955" target="_blank">01:55:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So in formalization, I mentioned before that it takes 10 times longer to formalize a proof than to write it by hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6961" target="_blank">01:56:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">With these modern AI tools, and also just better tooling, the lean developers are doing a great job adding more and more features and making it user-friendly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6971" target="_blank">01:56:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going from 9 to 8 to 7, okay, no big deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6975" target="_blank">01:56:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But one day it will drop below 1, and that's a phase shift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6980" target="_blank">01:56:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because suddenly it makes sense when you write a paper to write it in lean first, or through a conversation with AI, which is generally on the fly with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6991" target="_blank">01:56:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It becomes natural for journals to accept, and maybe they'll offer expedite refereeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6996" target="_blank">01:56:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">If a paper has already been formalized in lean, they'll just ask the referee to comment on the significance of the results and how it connects to literature, and not worry so much about the correctness, because that's been certified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7010" target="_blank">01:56:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Papers are getting longer and longer in mathematics, and it's harder and harder to get good refereeing for the really long ones, unless they're really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7017" target="_blank">01:56:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It is actually an issue, and the formalization is coming in at just the right time for this to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7023" target="_blank">01:57:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the easier and easier it gets because of the tooling and all the other factors, then you're going to see much more, like math, lib, will grow potentially exponentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7032" target="_blank">01:57:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a virtuous cycle, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7036" target="_blank">01:57:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one phase shift of this type that happened in the past was the adoption of LaTeX.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7039" target="_blank">01:57:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So LaTeX is this typesetting language that all mathematicians use now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7043" target="_blank">01:57:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the past, people used all kinds of word processors and typewriters and whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7047" target="_blank">01:57:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But at some point, LaTeX became easier to use than all other competitors, and people would just switch within a few years.</span></div><div

writing it, you know, just, you know, like the autocomplete alone is already, I use it, like it speeds up my own writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

two things that people thought was unrelated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7362" target="_blank">02:02:42.180</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7380" target="_blank">02:03:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, so, a version of this is, I mean, the physicists have a dream of getting the AIs to discover new laws of physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7386" target="_blank">02:03:06.680</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7395" target="_blank">02:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it actually even struggles, the current state of the art even struggles to discover old laws of physics from the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7401" target="_blank">02:03:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, or if it does, there's a big concern on contamination, that it did it only because, like, somewhere in this training data, it already somehow knew, you know, Boyle's law or whatever you're trying to reconstruct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7415" target="_blank">02:03:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of it is that we don't have the right type of training data for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7418" target="_blank">02:03:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So for laws of physics, like, we don't have, like, a million different universes or a million different laws of nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7425" target="_blank">02:03:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, a lot of what we're missing in math is actually the negative space of, so we have published things of things that people have been able to prove and conjectures that end up being verified or maybe counterexamples produced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7439" target="_blank">02:03:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But we don't have data on things that were proposed, and they're kind of a good thing to try, but then people quickly realized that it was the wrong conjecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7448" target="_blank">02:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they said, oh, but we should actually change our claim to modify it in this way to actually make it more plausible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7454" target="_blank">02:04:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a trial and error process, which is a real integral part of human mathematical discovery, which we don't record because it's embarrassing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7463" target="_blank">02:04:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We make mistakes, and we only like to publish our

that, basically, AI has to go through grad school and actually, you know, go to grad courses, do the assignments, go to office hours, make mistakes, get advice on how to correct the mistakes, and learn from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7487" target="_blank">02:04:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me ask you, if I

conjecture, and maybe speak to the journey that Grigori Perlman's been on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7531" target="_blank">02:05:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so it's a question about curved spaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7534" target="_blank">02:05:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Earth is a good example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7535" target="_blank">02:05:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So Earth can think of a 2D surface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7536" target="_blank">02:05:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">In just being round, it could maybe be a torus with a hole in it, or it could have many holes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7541" target="_blank">02:05:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are many different topologies, a priori, that a surface could have, even if you assume that it's bounded and smooth and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7550" target="_blank">02:05:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have figured out how to classify surfaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7552" target="_blank">02:05:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">As a first approximation, everything is determined by something called the genus, how many holes it has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7556" target="_blank">02:05:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So a sphere has genus zero, a donut has genus one, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7559" target="_blank">02:05:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And one way you can tell these surfaces apart, probably the sphere has, which is called simply connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7564" target="_blank">02:06:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If you take any closed loop on the sphere, like a big closed loop of rope, you can contract it to a point while staying on the surface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7572" target="_blank">02:06:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the sphere has this property, but a torus doesn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7574" target="_blank">02:06:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're on a torus, and you take a rope that goes around, say, the outer diameter torus, there's no way, it can't get through the hole.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7582" target="_blank">02:06:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no way to contract it to a point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7583" target="_blank">02:06:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it turns out that the sphere is the only surface with this property of contractibility, up to continuous deformations of the sphere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7592" target="_blank">02:06:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So things that are what are called topologically equivalent of the sphere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7596" target="_blank">02:06:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So Poincare asked the same question in higher dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7598" target="_blank">02:06:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it becomes hard to visualize, because the surface you can think of as embedded in three dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7604" target="_blank">02:06:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But a curved three space, we don't have good intuition of 4D space to live in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7609" target="_blank">02:06:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there are also 3D spaces that can't even fit into four dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7613" target="_blank">02:06:53.120</a></span> | <span

class="t">But anyway, mathematically, you can still pose this question, that if you have a bounded three-dimensional space now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7620" target="_blank">02:07:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">which also has this simply connected property, that every loop can be contracted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7624" target="_blank">02:07:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">can you turn it into a three-dimensional version of a sphere?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7626" target="_blank">02:07:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is the Poincare conjecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7628" target="_blank">02:07:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Weirdly, in higher dimensions, four and five, it was actually easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7631" target="_blank">02:07:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was solved first in higher dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7634" target="_blank">02:07:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There's somehow more room to do the deformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7636" target="_blank">02:07:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easier to move things around to a sphere.</span></div><div

the surface into little triangles or tetrahedra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7649" target="_blank">02:07:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and you just try to argue based on how the faces interact with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7651" target="_blank">02:07:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There were algebraic approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7656" target="_blank">02:07:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There's various algebraic objects, like things called the fundamental group,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7659" target="_blank">02:07:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can attach to these homology and cohomology and all these very fancy tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7664" target="_blank">02:07:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They also didn't quite work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7665" target="_blank">02:07:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But Richard Hamilton's proposed a partial differential equations approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7672" target="_blank">02:07:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So the problem is that you have this object which is sort of secretly a sphere, but it's given to you in a really weird way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7683" target="_blank">02:08:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So think of a ball that's being kind of crumpled up and twisted, and it's not obvious that it's a ball.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7688" target="_blank">02:08:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have some sort of surface which is a deformed sphere, you could, for example, think of it as the surface of a balloon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7698" target="_blank">02:08:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You could try to inflate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7699" target="_blank">02:08:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You blow it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7701" target="_blank">02:08:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And naturally, as you fill it up with air, the wrinkles will sort of smooth out, and it will turn into a nice round sphere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7708" target="_blank">02:08:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless, of course, it was a torus or something, in which case it would get stuck at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7712" target="_blank">02:08:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you inflate a torus, there would be a point in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7715" target="_blank">02:08:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">When the inner ring shrinks to zero, you get a singularity, and you can't flow any further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7719" target="_blank">02:08:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So he created this flow which is now called Ritchie flow, which is a way of taking an arbitrary surface or space, and smoothing it out to make it rounder and rounder, to make it look like a sphere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7731" target="_blank">02:08:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And he wanted to show that either this process would give you a sphere, or it would create a singularity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7737" target="_blank">02:08:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very much like how PDEs, either they have global regularity or finite and blow up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7741" target="_blank">02:09:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, it's almost exactly the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7744" target="_blank">02:09:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7745" target="_blank">02:09:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, and he showed that for two dimensions, two-dimensional surfaces, if you start a simplification, no singularity is ever formed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7753" target="_blank">02:09:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You never ran into trouble, and you could flow, and it would give you a sphere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7757" target="_blank">02:09:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he got a new proof of the two-dimensional result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7760" target="_blank">02:09:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, by the way, that's a beautiful explanation of Ritchie flow and its application in this context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7764" target="_blank">02:09:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How difficult is the mathematics here, like for the 2D cases?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7767" target="_blank">02:09:27.440</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7775" target="_blank">02:09:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But they were considered hard nonlinear equations to solve.</span></div><div

that this equation was actually supercritical, so it has the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7787"

So we should maybe step back for a little bit and just talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8301" target="_blank">02:18:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">prime numbers.

Is there a solution in the natural numbers? And the answer depends on an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8371" target="_blank">02:19:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">undecidable statement, whether the axioms of mathematics are consistent or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8376" target="_blank">02:19:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But even the simplest problems that combine something more applicative, such as the primes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8384" target="_blank">02:19:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">with something additive, such as shifting by two...

So what makes the twin prime conjecture hard is that if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8441" target="_blank">02:20:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you take all the primes in the world, you know, three, five, seven, eleven, and so forth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8445" target="_blank">02:20:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">there are some twins in there.

Um, and so for example, it was known for a long time that there were twin almost primes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8834" target="_blank">02:27:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, this has been worked out.

So you take any natural number, like say 13 and you apply the following</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9293" target="_blank">02:34:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">procedure to it. So if it's even, you divide it by two and if it's odd, you multiply it by three and add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9299" target="_blank">02:34:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">one. So even numbers get smaller, odd numbers get bigger. So 13 will become 40 because 13 times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9304" target="_blank">02:35:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">3 is 39. Add one, you get 40. So it's a simple process for odd numbers and even numbers. They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9309" target="_blank">02:35:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">both very easy operations. And then you put together, it's still reasonably simple. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9314" target="_blank">02:35:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but then you ask what happens when you iterate it. You take the output that you just got and feed it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9318" target="_blank">02:35:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">back in. So 13 becomes 40. 40 is now even divided by two is 20. 20 is still even divided by two, 10,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9325" target="_blank">02:35:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">five. And then five times three plus one is 16. And then eight, four, two, one. So, uh, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9331" target="_blank">02:35:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">from one, it goes one, four, two, one, four, two, one, it cycles forever. So the sequence I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9335" target="_blank">02:35:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">described, um, you know, 13, 40, 20, 10, so both, uh, these are also called hailstone sequences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9340" target="_blank">02:35:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's an oversimplified model of, of hailstone formation, you know, which is not actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9345" target="_blank">02:35:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">quite correct, but it's somehow taught to high school students as a first approximation is that, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9350" target="_blank">02:35:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like a, a little nugget of ice gets, gets a nice crystal forms in a cloud and it goes up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9356" target="_blank">02:35:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and down because of the wind.

So the conjecture is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9371" target="_blank">02:36:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">no matter how high you start up, like you take a number, which is in the millions or billions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9376" target="_blank">02:36:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">this process that goes up, if you're odd and down, if you're even, it eventually goes up to earth all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9382" target="_blank">02:36:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the time.

Right. Yeah. So it's, yeah, if you plot it, um, these sequences, they look like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9393" target="_blank">02:36:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Brownian motion.

Um, and so normally your wallet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9423" target="_blank">02:37:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">will hit, will go to zero.

So statistically it makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9428" target="_blank">02:37:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">sense. Yes.

Um, you know, so yeah, we, we all talked about it at, at tea and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10318" target="_blank">02:51:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">so forth. I mean, we, we didn't understand most of us sort of understand the proof. Um, we understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10323" target="_blank">02:52:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of high level details. Um, like there's an ongoing project to formalize it in lean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10327" target="_blank">02:52:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

It's really difficult to formalize,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10342" target="_blank">02:52:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">no? Yeah. I guess, yeah, you're right. The objects that they use, um, you can define them. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10347" target="_blank">02:52:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">so they've been defined in lean. Okay. So, so just defining what they are can be done. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10352" target="_blank">02:52:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that's really not trivial, but it's been done. Uh, but there's a lot of really basic facts about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10356" target="_blank">02:52:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">um, these objects that have taken decades to prove that they're in all these different math papers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10361" target="_blank">02:52:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so lots of these have to be formalized as well.

So that's why I've always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10984" target="_blank">03:03:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">been interested in exploring new workflows. About four or five years ago, I was on a committee where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10991" target="_blank">03:03:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">we had to ask for ideas for interesting workshops to run at a math institute. And at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10996" target="_blank">03:03:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Peter Schultz had just, uh, formalized one of his, his, um, new theorems. And, um, there's some other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11001" target="_blank">03:03:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">developments in computer-assisted proof that look quite interesting. And I said, oh, we should, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11006" target="_blank">03:03:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">should, uh, um, we should run a workshop on this. It's a pretty good idea. Um, and then I was a bit too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11012" target="_blank">03:03:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">enthusiastic about this idea. So I, I got voluntold to actually run it. Um, so I did with a bunch of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11018" target="_blank">03:03:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">people, Kevin Buzit and Jordan Ellenberg and a bunch of other people.

Um, that lots of nice proofs of concept, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11040" target="_blank">03:04:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">just sort of hints of, of what was going to happen. This was just before ChatGBT, but there was, even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11045" target="_blank">03:04:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">then there was one talk about language models and the potential, um, capability of, of those in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11049" target="_blank">03:04:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So that got me excited about the subject.
