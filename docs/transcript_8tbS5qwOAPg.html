As soon as I started to get more connected with my essence as a storyteller, all of a sudden, this world of options began to appear. It was like, oh, you could start a podcast, you could write a book, you could write articles.</p><p>There are all these different ways that you could express yourself as a storyteller. So then the question is, what do I do? One of the tools in the book is what I call a Dharma deck, which is anytime something emotionally inspired me, I would literally write it down on an index card.</p><p>Then what I would do is about once a week, I would go to a quiet place or take a walk, and I would take that stack of index cards with me, and I would sort them from top to bottom. The ones that had the most emotional pull for me, the ones that were calling me the most, stayed at the top of the pack.</p><p>The ones that didn't went to the bottom half of the pack. And what you notice over time is that there would probably be like somewhere between one and three cards that will always just stay at the top of the pack, right? No matter what, it's like, those are the ones that you don't wanna give up.</p></div></div></body></html>
