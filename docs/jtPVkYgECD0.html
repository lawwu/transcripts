But I actually remember saying that I didn't care about elite status that much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">because I don't travel that much, and we had so many points and miles saved up that we often use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">them to fly in premium cabins, business class, first class. And that gives us a lot of the features</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">we would get with status. And so if you asked me on the street six, seven months ago and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, how do you feel about elite status? I would say, it doesn't really matter. I'm not focused on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I found that funny because I started looking at where I ended up for 2025.

I looked and I ended up having status on four different airlines and four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">different hotel groups. And I want to talk about how that happened, what it means for the future and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">how it might impact your life. And I also want to share a few amazing takeaways I've gotten from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">listeners that you've all sent in, as well as some of the interesting things that are happening in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">world of travel points, miles, cards, some of what we've been sending out lately, and some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things I've been doing about it. So let's jump straight into airline status. And I'll talk a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">bit about what's going on. So first off Southwest, I don't think I have ever actually had Southwest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">status. I've gone for companion pass. But for those who aren't familiar, companion pass actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">is separate from their status, you can earn companion pass just by spending on a credit card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">get a free companion you can add. It's an awesome deal. We've done it multiple times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">highly recommend if you're traveling a lot with the same person to places Southwest flies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, the points you earn to get companion pass are different than the tier qualifying points you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">earn for status. And I rarely fly Southwest enough and on expensive enough tickets to earn anywhere close</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to what you need for A-list. However, there was this promo last year that I caught wind of in a Facebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">group about Southwest, where transferred points from hotel groups were actually counting as tier points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a separate promo where credit card spend was almost earning twice as many tier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">points as normal. Now, this was a really tight window from when I learned about it. Unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it never made it to the podcast because it was such a narrow window to act. I did share it with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">membership. So something worth taking a look at if you want to get alerted when I find these wild</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">things. But what happened was I transferred points from Marriott to Southwest and from Choice Hotels to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Southwest. And those cleared as tier points. And so very quickly, I was on my way to A-list. And then I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a Southwest credit card and I spent a little extra on that than I normally would. And by the end of last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">year, I found my way to A-list. Now, why did I even do this? Well, the primary reason I did it was because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Southwest had already announced that they were making a bunch of changes coming up this year. And one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">them was that there was going to be seat selection, including extra legroom and preferred seats. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">was the main big change they were going to do. There was no more pick your own seat. Boarding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't going to operate how it used to be. And I thought, gosh, if I have this limited opportunity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to get Southwest A-list, maybe when they make that change, I'll be able to pick seats and board and do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">all these things that I wouldn't otherwise be able to do. Now, I didn't know how much Southwest would end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">up changing between that point in time and this year. And specifically in the last week, for anyone who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">hasn't seen, Southwest has basically gone the way of every other airline and almost feels like it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">be indistinguishable from other airlines because all of the things that Southwest used to do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">made them so Southwest are either things that other airlines have already started doing or that they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">gotten rid of. So going forward, and I can't remember the exact start date. Some of these are flights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">booked after May 28th, 2025, but no free checked bags. There's one advantage to this, which I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">realize, which is that you have to pay these airline taxes and fees when you sell tickets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if bag fees are part of those tickets, you have to pay those taxes. When you unbundle those,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have to pay all those taxes on the bag fees. So there is some rational economic argument to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">do that. You will going forward still get two bags with A-list preferred and one with A-list or a credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">card. A Southwest card is an easy way to avoid that. They're going to add basic economy. They've already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">really slashed the earnings of their most inexpensive fare class in terms of number of points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll earn. Flight credits you get from canceled reservations or refunded flights are only going to last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">one year or even six months with those fares. And so lots of changes. So having A-list will actually avoid a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">these. You'll get to pick seats, change your flights, early boarding, free checked bags and all that stuff. So I'm actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">really happy that I ended up with this status this year because once these changes go into effect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">this will add some value and who knows where we'll be traveling on Southwest later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That said, it's kind of what made Southwest. And now Southwest just feels like every other airline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Every other airline now made all of their flights cancelable and refundable into credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that last one year. All the other airlines have no free checked bags unless you have a credit card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">status and they have basic economy and all these seat rules. So not sure what would make Southwest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">any different or preferable other than maybe a slight preference for less mechanical issues because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">they seem to only operate one or two airline types. So I know that is one of the reasons they've done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that. But for the most part, sometimes if we're going on a trip during ski season, we think Southwest's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">great. We get all these free checked bags and we're going to be needing them. Going forward,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that's just not going to be the case. So a little bit of a segue, but that was how I ended up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Southwest A-list status this year. I also ended up with United Silver. And based in the Bay Area,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">United is probably the best airline for coverage in terms of direct flights from SFO. And I don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">how it happened because I don't fly that much, but I just barely made it into enough premier qualifying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">points to end up with silver, which is their lowest tier of status, gets you almost no benefits other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">than a checked bag. And you can pick preferred seats. You can't even pick economy plus seats with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">extra leg room until 24 hours before departure, at which point they are almost always taken or only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">middle seats left. And so I think the reason I got there was that I was right towards the end of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">year. And I was close enough that if I paid, it was like $150 to upgrade a flight from economy to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">business for a flight where business meant nothing, like flying down to Los Angeles from San Francisco,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but that pushed me over the edge. And I figured depending on how much we fly United this year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and whether we're checking bags and traveling as a family and wanting to pick good seats, probably worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it for a couple hundred dollars, especially when that hundred dollars comes with some benefit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and additional miles crude. So probably $80 or something. And now, sure enough, we are flying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">United in the near future and we'll be checking a few bags and that will probably have ended up saving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">us more money than it cost. Next, I ended up with Delta status. Shout out to Josh, who I met on our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Iceland trip. He was trying to strategize his way to get to Diamond on Delta. And I spent a lot of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">brainstorming some ideas and giving him some tools that he could probably use to make that happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a thank you, which was not necessary at all, he used one of his Delta medallion benefits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">from hitting Diamond to gift me gold status.

One of the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">trips I've ever taken. Then next there was Alaska MVP. Now I did a status match from built and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">expired in January. So I went into the year with that status. But if you asked me a couple of weeks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">ago, I would have said, didn't matter. I don't really fly Alaska a lot. And then somehow just in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">first two and a half months of the year, almost every trip I've needed to take, I've been on Alaska</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm already halfway back to MVP status on Alaska. And so just to make sure that I had enough points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to get there, because for whatever reason, it seems like I'm flying Alaska a lot. And I already have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">flights in later in the year on Alaska. I ended up picking up the Alaska business card, not only because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it had a great signup bonus of 75,000 points, you get a companion fare.

I thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it was a one time thing. But the more I read about it, it seems like you can do it every single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But until I book a flight on Air France, it doesn't seem like there's any benefit to doing this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if I have Delta status, you know, the Sky Team status from Air France wouldn't matter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">either. Funny enough, the one airline that I probably haven't flown in the last five years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which is American, and obviously, there's plenty of airlines around the world that I haven't flown,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but the one US based mainstream airline that I haven't flown is the one I'm most intrigued about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to earn their status.

You don't actually have to fly the airline at all. And I thought going into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the year once I was booking these Alaska flights that it might be the right path because almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">every benefit of Alaska elite status is also given to people with American elite status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I ended up also getting the American business card this year, they do have this really interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">promo going on this year, where best I understand, at least on the business card, when you add an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">authorized employee card, whoever the employee is earns loyalty points, and the main cardholder does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I were to use that card and try to earn loyalty points, using an employee card for my wife, we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">both end up with American status. There are milestone rewards along the way. So we both get those milestone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">rewards. For some reason, that makes no sense to me. And I'm going to come back to this at the end of talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">all these statuses. I want to do this. I don't fly American, their route network from the Bay Area is pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">terrible. The only place I've ever considered flying them is to Los Angeles, where every time I've done that five,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">six years ago, it seems like you always land at a remote terminal that you need to take a bus to, which is the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">inconvenient thing. It's certainly not fast. And so I have no idea why I'm interested in this. But it does seem a little bit like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">game, right? Going down the path of Oh, what kinds of things can I do to earn extra loyalty points? I signed up for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">newsletter called loyalty point hunters. And so I get these like, Oh, here's this offer where you buy a meal kit. And the discount</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">basically makes it $5. But you get 1000s of loyalty points. And a part of me just really wants to play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">this game.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to address my own problems after I run through this inventory.

Because they do provide a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of benefit when you have a lot of statuses, you're boarding early, you're earning more points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not paying for check bags, all kinds of things like that.

So one of the things I was thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">last year was, gosh, if we fly United enough that it would be valuable to pick the right seats, get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">free check bags, all those kinds of things. Should I just get it by trying to do more Marriott nights or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">should I get it by going for United status itself? Because it's not reciprocal the other way. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">think United Silver gets you anything meaningful on Marriott. I do think if you earned high enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">United status, you would, but I certainly haven't. To do that, though, you need to spend 75 nights in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Marriott, which I probably spent nowhere near 75. However, with the right set of Marriott cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you get a huge head start. So most of the consumer cards give you 15 nights towards your status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then on top of that, if you get the Bonvoy Brilliant card, that gets you 25 nights. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the business cards will also get you 15 nights. So if you have both, you can get 15 nights. And if one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of your consumer cards is the Brilliant card, then you get 40 nights. The funny thing is, though, if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">really chasing that status, that Brilliant card also comes with Platinum status, which I think is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">most important status for Marriott stays because it gets you the free breakfast, the upgrades and late</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">checkout and all those things. Do you have a higher priority on those upgrades with higher status? Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But it clears the hurdle of I'm staying at a resort, I want the free breakfast, I want a lot of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">perks. And so you just get that with the card. So if you're someone who cares about Marriott status,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that card will just get it to you. You don't have to worry about anything. The other thing that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting is Marriott does have this lifetime status program. And I'm at the point going into this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">year, I had eight years of being Platinum. Last year, I didn't have it. So I ended up opening up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Brilliant card, because that would clock me in at Platinum status for 2024. I would have it also in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">2025. So that would take me to nine. And next year will take me to 10. And so by holding that card for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what will end up being about 15 months, that should put me over the threshold to have Platinum on Marriott</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">for the rest of my life. And I will never have to hold a card or think about status at all. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">really excited about that. Now, does it make sense to push for titanium on Marriott or,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, silver on United? I'm not sure. I still have to think about that. Because I'm starting out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">with 40 nights, that still is 25 nights in a Marriott, which is a lot of nights. There is one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">credit card, I can't remember the name of it. It's a chase one that lets you earn elite nights by spending,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but it is almost prohibitively expensive. That's something I'm thinking about. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Marriott is a program where recent devaluations, which I'll talk about in a bit, have just made it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a little tricky to be really loved.

Because Marriott just continues to make things difficult for everyone. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">literally a matrix that I'll link to in the show notes that you need to follow to try to figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">whether you're actually going to get a free breakfast based on how you booked your reservation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're staying, what chain, etc. They don't make things simple or straightforward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">whatsoever. So that's Marriott. Where I actually switched all my loyalty this year to was Hyatt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So last year, going into the year, I thought, this status of Hyatt seems to be the thing everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in the points and miles world loves. I've never had Hyatt status. I rarely had ever stayed at a Hyatt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">hotel. And it was very hard to get. And so the reason why most people seem to love this status is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because you really get treated like an elite member of their loyalty program, because it's a lot harder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to get. Marriott, you can get, you know, platinum status with a credit card. Hilton, you can get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">diamond status, their top tier with a credit card. I think IHG, you can also do that. So if you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">get top tier status on Hyatt, it is way harder. You need to spend 60 nights in a Hyatt, or you need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">augment those 60 nights by spending a ton of money on one of their credit cards. And each one of those credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">cards for every $10,000 you spend, you get five elite nights, which means to get all the way to 60,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to spend $120,000. Now, if you have a lot of tax payments, business expenses, or you're running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a gift card site, you might have the spend to do it. But you might be asking yourself, is it even worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it? Now, if you're earning one Hyatt point per dollar at 1.7 cents per point, depending on who you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">ask, maybe you could call it 1.3, 1.5. It's not as good as other cards that might earn you three or four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">points until you think about it in the context of getting all the way to the status. So when I mapped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">out, what would it look like to get to 60 nights? How would I make it happen? Along the way, Hyatt gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you all these milestone rewards, right?

You're getting these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">things called a guest of honor certificate, which I will probably be doing a giveaway for later this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">where you can gift someone else globalist status for a stay up to seven nights. And so when you add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">all those in, I put the value of spending money on that Hyatt card at about 3.4% back because you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">getting the points and those perks, which made it worth going for.

And so I found a category one property,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the lowest tier. I found it at an off peak time. And I found it locally. So I only had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to drive 20, 30 minutes to get to.

But if you could leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this room available, I will check in with you regularly. So you know that I might come back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I would really appreciate it. I put the do not disturb sign on. And every two days, I would text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the front desk and say, I don't know if I'll need this room, but please keep it open for me. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">had no problem. The seven nights posted. And it was a lot easier than spending an extra, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for seven nights, you could probably call it somewhere on the order of $15,000 on the card. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">ended up going for that. I'm really excited to put that to use this year, especially because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the features of Hyatt that is unique is it's very easy to book suites. And so if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">traveling with a family, and you have kids that go to bed early, and you don't want to have to spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the time after they're in bed in a quiet, dark room sitting there being silent, not even being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">see much, you can book a suite. And Hyatt lets you confirm those suites at booking, or use suite upgrade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">awards to confirm them for no additional cost. And so doing that is just such a great experience when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">traveling with kids. So that's one of the reasons I'm excited about Hyatt Globalist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">among lots of others. So I will probably share more about that at the end of the year once we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">been able to use that status. On the other two hotel statuses, there was a built promo to get a core</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">platinum status. So I did that. And we have the Hilton Aspire card, which includes free Hilton diamond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">status. And those Hilton cards, which right now have really great signup bonuses, you can go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">all the hacks.com slash cards and check them out. But they just make it so easy to earn free nights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And as much as I love Hyatt, for certain reasons, married for some reasons, the thing I love about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Hilton is that their free night certificates are good for any category hotel, as long as they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">standard room availability. So we use those hotel certificates last year to stay at a hotel that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">was three or $4,000 a night. And right now open a card, the signup bonus includes a certificate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the cards, you get another one when you spend $15,000. Some of them, it's $30,000. It really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">depends. There's a different flavor of card for everyone. But the Aspire card also comes with diamond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">status on Hilton, which is their top tier. So that's how we ended up with four hotel status tiers. I guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have any IHG status, but haven't stayed in an IHG hotel for a really long time. So I thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it'd be interesting to share all of that, because that's how I ended up where we are today. And I did all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that despite feeling like status wasn't an important thing. And I'm not really sure why we didn't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have a lot of travel planned this year. And as I reflect on this, and in the spirit of my conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">with Simon Sinek, I will try to be a little bit more vulnerable. Like, I think I just have a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bit of a problem where I enjoy figuring out a system and trying to kind of level up in the same way as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">kid, I enjoyed playing Super Mario and trying to get to the end of the game. It was figure out all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the strategies and the tactics to get through the level and get to the next one and get to the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">one. And then at the end, you win, and you save the princess and everything's great. And each one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">these challenges to get these statuses feels like that. It's like, oh, I want to get Hyatt status, but I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">want to find out if it's worth it. So I get to build this model and I get to figure out whether the ROI is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">good. Well, the ROI is good in that the amount of Hyatt points and milestone benefits I've earned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">are technically worth an amount that is greater than what I would have gotten if I used 3% cashback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">card. However, it's only greater if I actually use those benefits. And right now, we're sitting on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">millions of points and miles that we haven't used. And so I have to ask myself, if I look hard in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">mirror, am I actually getting the value that I believe I'm getting? And in the points and miles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">world, if you talk to people that play it really, really hard, earning millions and millions and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">millions of points a month, what they find out is that they can't use the points fast enough and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">end up cashing them out in various ways at way lower value than what you think there should be worth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? If you're someone who only has a million Amex points, you might be able to use them for travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">for the next three or four years. But if you had 50 million Amex points, you might never be able to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">them for travel because there's just too many. And so even though there might be some amazing redemption</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that gets you two or three or four cents per point, if you're never going to take that redemption</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because you have too many points, then it's not worth that. And so I'm at a point where looking hard in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">mirror is telling me that I should probably earn less points. I should probably stop chasing these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">statuses, even though I get a ton of satisfaction out of it. Or, and this is where I convince myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the alternative, we just say every year the kids are out of school, we just take a really big trip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">where we're staying in lots of hotels, using up all these points, traveling a lot, and really focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">on going lots of places. And I rationalize some of this to myself saying, well, by earning status and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">earning points across tons of different programs, we have the ultimate flexibility, right? I tell myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that because we have points in, I don't know, probably five hotel groups and 15 airline groups and five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">transferable points groups, I now have the flexibility when we travel to stay anywhere we want because of all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">these programs. But that's not really true. Because we were talking about wanting to go visit the island of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Lanai, or I think it's actually pronounced Lanai in Hawaii. And I'd heard a story of a trip report on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">another podcast where someone said it was the most magical trip they've ever taken. They said it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the best islands, you have to check it out. I actually have some friends that work to help design</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the hotels on the island. Turns out, they're just two Four Seasons hotels. And so no amount of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott, you know, IHG points or Amex points could be used for anything other than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe booking in a travel portal a room at the Four Seasons. And so I think sometimes points are also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">restrictive. And what I've come to the conclusion of recently, is that I need to let go of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">restrictions. And so one thing that I will start doing more of is using my points, even if it means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the travel portal for one and a half cents, when I know they probably could get more value,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but just sitting there, they're not. And so that's something that I'm going to be making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a change. Obviously, we haven't planned out all our travel for this year, but things will come up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I assume that these statuses will get put to good use. But I really think I need to start using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">these points, even if it's not the perfect redemption, because just letting them sit there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, they're constantly getting devalued, which I will talk about in a minute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And if that money was sitting in cashback, it'd be earning interest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I owe it to myself to actually try to bring down the balance of points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So stay tuned on how successful I am at this and really changing a little bit of this behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But after I prepped for this episode and thought about how I should really be rethinking these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I met with someone and they talked to me about how there's a way to earn Japan Airlines status</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for life with one of their credit cards.

And here I am again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">wanting to go chase status on an airline that isn't even based in the US, which has reciprocal benefits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">on most airlines that I'm not flying when I'm also chasing status on an airline in that alliance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">separately. So we'll see where it goes. But one of the things I just mentioned was the reason to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">using your points is that they're always getting devalued. And I sent this in the newsletter and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">something I'm going to try today is I'm going to try to run through some of the most interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">things that have been happening as well as some amazing listener stories. Some of these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">have been in the newsletter.

But if you're not, and you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure that when things like this happen, you hear about them, go to allthehacks.com slash email</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can sign up. So devaluations are something that happens all the time. And last year, we saw a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">handful of them across tons of different airlines. Just in 2025, we've already seen a few. Avianca, which was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">one of my preferred ways to use miles to fly on United or Air Canada or Lufthansa because they had such great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">deals. They just increased their award prices in business anywhere from 8% to 15%. In first class, all the way up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">25%. So that kind of stuff happens all the time. It's one of the reasons that I love transferable points, because if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">keep your points in Amex or Chase, and this happens to Avianca, well, now you can prioritize Air Canada, or you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">could prioritize United. Whereas if you accrue in one airline, and this happens, it makes it really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">difficult. On the hotel front, Marriott had big devaluations, they fluctuated a lot of the things, they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">introduced dynamic award pricing. So it's not always clear what number of points you need for a room. There is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">secret award chart that I'll link to in the show notes, but they've made some devaluations this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Hilton increased the points required for most premium properties, with some top tier hotels going way over 100,000 points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a night.

But it is another good reason to not stash and hoard points, because you're just going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">stuck with them being worth less and less over time.

Members actually get 50% off. Or there's a new one, I think SaveWise is also offering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">this service.

But there are three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">offers that are really interesting that are probably a lot bigger than most of them. You'll see an offer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that's 10% off or 5% off or $10 off. But there's three right now that are really big. One of them is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for Calm. And if you have either the Chase Reserve or the Chase Preferred card, you can get 50 to 100%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">back on an annual membership. So the Reserve is going for a full 100% back on a Calm annual membership</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">through the end of May.

And they're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of in the health and wellness area. The next one is for a company called Lifeforce. So I haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">actually used this product.

So I've been trying a lot of things out. They have a diagnostic where you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">50 plus biomarkers, blood tests, service, and then you get a consultation with a clinician. It's $599.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's an offer right now on both Chase Reserve and Preferred for $300 back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last one is with Pronuvo, which I've talked about in the past, I've done a full body MRI with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Pronuvo two times in the past. Normally, that would cost $2,500. And if you do have a Chase Reserve card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you get a $600 back offer. So that brings the cost down to $1,900. However, one thing not everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">might know is that Pronuvo, like many other health services, is eligible for an HSA or an FSA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you were to spend that $2,500, but reimburse yourself from your FSA or an HSA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on your tax bracket and where you're at, that could bring that cost down, maybe at the highest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">tax bracket in California, in half.

But in specific numbers, he said the quote for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">IVF at home was $30,000 to $50,000.

They said they got an average of four cents a point from all 1.3</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2869" target="_blank">00:47:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">million points. And a lot of these people said that this is not something that they've been doing for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a while. And they said just listening and taking the leap has been what made this happen and really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">stoked.

And then by the end of this year, already set to accumulate a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2888" target="_blank">00:48:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">million miles. From a combo of signup bonuses and spend, they're really racking it up. So that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">awesome.

And then I think of myself, a couple days ago, I did what is often called an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Aparama. But I basically opened up a Bank of America, Alaska business card and a city American</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">card. And the signup bonus on all three of those totaled about 225,000 points. And both my wife and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I this year opened up an Amex business gold when it was a 200,000 point signup bonus. So last year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">those five cards, which weren't all the cards we opened up last year and includes none of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">spending was already over 600,000 points. And so and that's just one under my wife. So if she had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just done the exact same thing as I did, probably easily be at a million. And that was just what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">did in the tail end of the year. So definitely something that's possible, even if you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a ton of business spend to do. Last is one of my favorite stories. So Brandon sent in this epic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">photo, which with his permission, I will put in the show notes, they had a contractor who was building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">out some renovations or their house. And he asked if they could pay for the building materials. So their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">contractor wouldn't let them pay by credit card, but they were willing to let them go to Lowe's and pay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">for the materials themselves. And so they had about $170,000 to spend at Lowe's. First, they bought all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lowe's gift cards they could at a deal. Unfortunately, they were only able to get up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">5,000. This was before I had launched the gift card site. And then they put the rest on their credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. And between him and his brother, they stacked out a bunch of different credit cards, rang it up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">$170,000. And if you just assume an average return of let's call it two points or two and a half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPVkYgECD0&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">percent, they earned back over $4,000 of value.
