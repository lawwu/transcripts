And then he was on the OpenAI super alignment team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">may it rest in peace. And now he, with some anchor investments from Patrick and John Collison,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and Daniel Gross, and Nat Friedman, is launching an investment firm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Leopold, I know you're off to a slow start, but life is long, and I wouldn't worry about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">too much.

I first discovered your podcast when your best episode had like a couple hundred views.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it's just been amazing to follow your trajectory.

Well, I think in the Shelter and Trenton episode, I mentioned that a lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">things I've learned about AI, I've learned from talking with them. And the third part of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">triumvirate, probably the most significant in terms of the things that I've learned about AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">has been you. We'll get all the stuff on the record now. Great. Okay, first thing I had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">get on record. Tell me about the trillion-dollar cluster. By the way, I should mention, so the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">context of this podcast is today, you're releasing a series called Situational Awareness. We're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to get into it. First question about that is, tell me about the trillion-dollar cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So, you know, unlike basically most things that have come out of Silicon Valley recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, AI is kind of this industrial process. The next model doesn't just require some code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's building a giant new cluster. Now it's building giant new power plants. Pretty soon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be building giant new fabs. And since that, this kind of extraordinary sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">techno-capital acceleration has been set into motion. I mean, basically, exactly a year ago</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">today, NVIDIA had their first kind of blockbuster earnings call, right? Where it went up 25% after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hours and everyone was like, "Oh my God, AI, it's a thing." You know, I mean, I think within a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, NVIDIA data center revenue has gone from like, you know, a few billion a quarter to like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, 20, 25 billion a quarter now and, you know, continuing to go up.

The question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">do they pay off?

So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like 10 billion fine, you know, and it'll pay off the, you know, 2024 size training cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, really when sort of big tech, it'll be gangbusters is a hundred billion a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the question is sort of how feasible is a hundred billion a year from AI revenue.

But I think, you know, if you sort of believe in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">trajectory of the AI systems as I do, and which we'll probably talk about, it's not that crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So, there's I think there's like 300 million, you know, Microsoft Office subscribers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.

It's a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">For a third of Office subscribers?

What can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it do the one on the 10 gigawatt data center?

There, you know, there's this chatbot, you know, and things like being able to use a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">computer, things like being able to do kind of like a genetic long horizon tasks. And then I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">think by 27, 28, you know, if you extrapolate the trends, and you know, we'll talk about that more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">later. And I talked about in the series, I think we hit, you know, basically, you know, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as smart as the smartest experts, I think on a hobbling trajectory kind of points to, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">looks much more like an agent than a chatbot.

That's sort of plus four rooms, plus four to the magnitude on test-time compute,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just on one problem.

It writes some code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">even if it can do a little bit of iterative debugging, but eventually it just kind of gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stuck in something. It can't correct its errors and so on. And in a sense, there's this big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">overhang, right?

Where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">can trade off train time and test-time compute. And if you can use four rooms, more test-time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">compute, that's almost like a three and a half room bigger model. Just because, again, if a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred tokens a minute, a few million tokens, that's a few months of sort of working time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot more you can do in a few months of working time than right now. So the question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">how hard is it to unlock that?

You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">need to learn the kind of planning tokens. That's kind of like, "I'm going to start by making a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">plan.

I'm going to think about it." And so it's not things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">models can do right now. But the question is, how hard is that? And in some sense also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there's sort of two paths to agents, right? When Sholto was on your podcast, he talked about kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of scaling leading to more nines of reliability. And so that's one path. I think the other path is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a sort of unhobbling path where it needs to learn this kind of system two process. And if it can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">learn this sort of system two process, it can just use kind of millions of tokens and think for them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and be cohesive and be coherent. One analogy, so when you drive, here's an analogy. When you drive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Okay, you're driving. And most of the time you're kind of on autopilot, right? You're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of driving and you're doing well. But sometimes you hit like a weird construction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">zone or a weird intersection. And then I sometimes, my passenger seat, my girlfriend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm kind of like, "Ah, be quiet for a moment. I need to figure out what's going on." And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of like, you go from autopilot to like the system two is jumping in and you're thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">how to do it. And so scaling is improving that system one autopilot. And I think it's the brute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">force way to get to kind of agents.

And I think there's still like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a huge amount that you're not doing with them. And by the way, I think this sort of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this pre-training advantage is also sort of the difference to robotics, right? Where I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">robotics, you know, I think people used to say it was a hardware problem, but I think the hardware</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff is getting solved. But the thing we have right now is you don't have this huge advantage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of being able to bootstrap yourself with pre-training. You don't have all this sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">unsupervised learning you can do. You have to start right away with the sort of RL self-play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. All right. So now the question is why might some of this unhobbling and RL and so on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">work? And again, there's sort of this advantage of bootstrapping, right? So, you know, your Twitter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">bio is being pre-trained, right?

You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not being pre-trained anymore.

At some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">point, you transition to being able to like learn by yourself, right? You weren't able to do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in elementary school. I don't know, middle school probably, high school is maybe when it sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">started, you need some guidance.

And then sort of models are just starting to enter that regime, right? And so it's sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like, it's a little bit, probably a little bit more scaling. And then you've got to figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what goes on top and it won't be trivial, right? So a lot of deep learning is sort of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it sort of seems very obvious in retrospect. And there's sort of some obvious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">cluster of ideas, right?

So I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">saying this, you know, we're going to get this, you know, next month or whatever. I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take a while to like really figure out a while for you.

It's sort of pre-training is kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">words are flying by. Yeah. Right. You know, and, and, or it's like, you know, the teacher's lecturing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to you and the models, you know, the words are flying by, you know, they're taking, they're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">getting a little bit from it.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, some word cells just skim through reread and reread the math textbook. And then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">memorize that sort of, you know, like if you just repeated the data, then they memorize what you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is you kind of like, you read a page, kind of think about it. You have some internal monologue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going on. You have a conversation with a study buddy. You try a practice problem, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you fail a bunch of times. At some point it clicks and you're like, this made sense. Then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you read a few more pages. And so we've kind of bootstrapped our way to being, being able to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that now with models or like just starting to be able to do that. And then the question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, being able to like read it, think about it, you know, try problems. And the question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">can you, you know, all this sort of self-play synthetic data RL is kind of like making that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">thing work. So basically translate, translated, translating, like in context, right? Like right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">now there's like in-context learning, right? Super sample efficient. There's that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Gemini paper, right? It just like learns a language in context. And then you're pre-training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">not at all sample efficient. But, you know, what humans do is they kind of like, they do in-context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">learning. You read a book, you think about it until eventually it clicks. But then you somehow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">distill that back into the weights. And in some sense, that's sort of like what RL is trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">do. And like when RL is super finicky, but when RL works, RL is kind of magical because it's sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the best possible data for the model. It's like when you try a practice problem and it, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you fail. And at some point you kind of figure it out in a way that makes sense to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's sort of like the best possible data for you. Cause like the way you would have solved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the problem. And that's sort of, that's what RL is. Rather than just, you know, you kind of read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how somebody else solved the problem and doesn't, you know, initially click. Yeah. By the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if that take sounds familiar, because it was like part of the question I asked John Schulman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that goes to illustrate the thing I said in the intro where like a bunch of the things I've learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">about AI, it just like, we do these dinners before the interviews and you show up in a couple. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Oh, what should I ask John Schulman? What should I ask Dario? Okay. Suppose this is the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">things go. And we get these in hobblings. Yeah. And the scaling, right? So it's like, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this baseline, just enormous force of scaling, right. Where it's like GP2 to GP4, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">GP2, it could kind of like, it was amazing, right. It could string together plausible sentences,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but you know, it could, it could barely do anything. It was kind of like preschooler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then GP4 is, you know, it's writing code. It like, you know, can do hard math. It's sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like smart high school. And so this big jump and, you know, and sort of the essay series,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I go through and kind of count the orders of magnitude of compute scale up with algorithmic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">progress. And so sort of scaling alone, you know, sort of by 27, 28 is going to do another kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">preschool to high school jump on top of GP4. And so that'll already be just like at a per token</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">level, just incredibly smart.

And then you add these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on hobblings that make it look much less like a chatbot, more like this agent, like a drop-in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">remote worker.

I mean, there's a few reasons. I mean, one of them is just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people aren't thinking about this as the EGI superintelligence cluster.

But I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2846" target="_blank">00:47:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they might realize that actually, you know, this is going to be useful for, you know, sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they might say it's inference compute.

Sure. So a few reasons, right. One is just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't think about this as the EGI cluster.

Right. Another one is like, you know, people saying some people think that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't do it in the U.S. And, you know, I think we actually face a sort of real system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">competition here because again, some people think it's only autocracies that can do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that can kind of like top down, mobilize the sort of industrial capacity, the power,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, get the stuff done fast.

But, you know, during the Cold War, like we really, there was this sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of intense system competition, right. Like East West Germany was this, right. Like West Germany,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like liberal democratic capitalism versus kind of, you know, communist state plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2906" target="_blank">00:48:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, now it's obvious that the sort of, you know, the free world would win. But,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, even as late as like '61, you know, Paul Samuelson was predicting that the Soviet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Union would outgrow the United States because they were able to sort of mobilize industry better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, there's some people who, you know, shitpost about loving America by day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but then in private they're betting against America.

And I think, I basically just think it's a bad bet. And the reason I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a bad bet is I think this stuff is just really possible in the U.S. And so to make it possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the U.S., there's some amount that we have to get our act together, right. So I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">basically two paths to doing it in the U.S. One is you just got to be willing to do natural gas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's ample natural gas, right.

But the issue there is, you know, a lot of people have sort of these made these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">climate commitments and not just government.

So they won't do natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">gas. And, you know, I admire the climate commitments, but I think at some point, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the national interest and national security kind of is more important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The other path is like, you know, you can do this sort of green energy mega projects, right. You do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the solar and the batteries and the, you know, the SMRs and geothermal.

I mean, just, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8816" target="_blank">02:26:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, future fund, you know, the yeah, I mean, so that was that was sort of the heyday. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8821" target="_blank">02:27:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then obviously, you know, when, when in sort of, you know, November of 22,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8825" target="_blank">02:27:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it was kind of revealed that Sam was this, you know, giant fraud. And from one day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8831" target="_blank">02:27:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to the next, you know, the whole thing collapsed. I was just really tough. I mean, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8836" target="_blank">02:27:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously it was devastating. It was devastating, obviously, for the people at their money and FTX,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8841" target="_blank">02:27:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, closer to home, you know, all that, you know, all these grantees, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8846" target="_blank">02:27:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we wanted to help them and we thought they were doing amazing projects. And so but instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8849" target="_blank">02:27:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">helping them, we ended up saddling them with like a giant problem. You know, personally, it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8854" target="_blank">02:27:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it was a startup. Right. And so I, you know, I'd worked 70 hour weeks every week for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8858" target="_blank">02:27:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, basically a year on this to kind of build this up. You know, we're a tiny team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8860" target="_blank">02:27:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from one day to the next, it was all gone and not just gone. It was associated with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8866" target="_blank">02:27:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this giant fraud. And so, you know, that was incredibly tough. Yeah. And then were there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8873" target="_blank">02:27:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">any signs early on that SBF was. Yeah, I mean, obviously I didn't know he was a fraud and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8880" target="_blank">02:28:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">whole, you know, I would have never worked there. You know, and, you know, we weren't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8885" target="_blank">02:28:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we were a separate thing. We weren't working with the business. I mean, I think I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8890" target="_blank">02:28:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think there are some takeaways for me. I think one takeaway was, you know, I think there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8895" target="_blank">02:28:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I had this tendency. I think people in general have this tendency to kind of like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8898" target="_blank">02:28:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">give successful CEOs a pass on their behavior because, you know, they're successful CEOs and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8902" target="_blank">02:28:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that's how they are. And that's just successful CEO things. And, you know, I didn't know Sam</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8908" target="_blank">02:28:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Bankman Fried was a fraud, but I knew SBF and I knew he was extremely risk taking. Right. I knew</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8913" target="_blank">02:28:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">he he was narcissistic.

Well, you know, sort of by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8920" target="_blank">02:28:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">end, he and I just like didn't get along well. And sort of I think the reason for that was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8924" target="_blank">02:28:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there's some biosecurity grants you really like because they're kind of cool and flashy.

And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8931" target="_blank">02:28:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">pointed that out and he was pretty unhappy about that. And so I knew his character.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8936" target="_blank">02:28:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, I feel like one takeaway for me was was, you know, like I think it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8945" target="_blank">02:29:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">worth paying attention to people's character, including like people you work for and successful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8949" target="_blank">02:29:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">CEOs. And, you know, that can save you a lot of pain down the line. OK. So after that, FTX implodes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8957" target="_blank">02:29:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're out. And then you got into you, you went to OpenAI, the super alignment team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8966" target="_blank">02:29:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">had just started. I think you were you were like part of the initial team. And so what was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8972" target="_blank">02:29:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">original idea? What was compelling about that for you to join? Yeah, totally. So, I mean, what was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=8978" target="_blank">02:29:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the goal of the super alignment team?

And the reason we needed that is, you know, basically, you know, RLHF probably won't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9007" target="_blank">02:30:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">scale to superhuman systems.

I thought this was basically, you know, I still do. I mean, even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9037" target="_blank">02:30:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">more so do. I think there's a lot of just really promising sort of ML research on alignment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9042" target="_blank">02:30:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on sort of aligning superhuman systems.

There's always a lot of people kind of making hay about it. And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9070" target="_blank">02:31:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I appreciate people highlighting the importance of the problem.

So this team itself has dissolved,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9140" target="_blank">02:32:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but you were the sort of first person who left or was forced to leave.

I think sort of John said on my podcast a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9245" target="_blank">02:34:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks ago. Anyway, so that's it. That's it. So that's pretty thin for if the cause was leaking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9254" target="_blank">02:34:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that seems pretty thin. Was there anything else to it? Yeah, I mean, so that was that was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9258" target="_blank">02:34:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">leaking claim. I mean, say a bit more about sort of what happened. Sure. Yeah. So one thing was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9265" target="_blank">02:34:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">last year I had written a memo, internal memo about opening eye security. I thought it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9271" target="_blank">02:34:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, egregiously insufficient. You know, I thought it wasn't sufficient to protect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9274" target="_blank">02:34:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the theft of model weights or or key algorithmic secrets from foreign actors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9277" target="_blank">02:34:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wrote this memo. I shared it with a few colleagues, a couple members of leadership</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9283" target="_blank">02:34:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">who sort of mostly said it was helpful. But then, you know, a couple weeks later, a sort of major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9289" target="_blank">02:34:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">security incident occurred, and that prompted me to share the memo with a couple members of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9293" target="_blank">02:34:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">board. And so after I did that, you know, days later, it was made very clear to me that leadership</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9299" target="_blank">02:34:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was very unhappy with me having shared this memo with the board. You know, apparently the board</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9304" target="_blank">02:35:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">had hassled leadership about security. And then I got sort of an official H.R. warning for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9309" target="_blank">02:35:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">memo, you know, for sharing it with the board. The H.R. person told me it was racist to worry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9315" target="_blank">02:35:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about CCP espionage. And they said it was sort of unconstructive. And, you know, look, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9322" target="_blank">02:35:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I probably wasn't at my most diplomatic.

But, you know, I thought it was a really, really important issue. And, you know, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9331" target="_blank">02:35:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">security incident had made me really worried anyway. And so I guess the reason I bring this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9335" target="_blank">02:35:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">up is when I was fired, it was sort of made very explicit that the security memo is a major reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9340" target="_blank">02:35:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for my being fired. You know, I think it was something like, you know, the reason that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9343" target="_blank">02:35:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is a firing and not a warning is because of the security memo. But you sharing it with the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9349" target="_blank">02:35:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The warning I'd gotten for the security memo. Anyway, and I mean, some other, you know, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9356" target="_blank">02:35:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">might also be helpful context is the sort of questions they asked me when they fired me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9359" target="_blank">02:35:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, this was a bit over a month ago. I was pulled aside for a chat with a lawyer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9363" target="_blank">02:36:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that quickly turned very adversariable. And, you know, the questions were all about my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9369" target="_blank">02:36:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">views on AI progress, on AGI, on the level of security appropriate for AGI, on, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9377" target="_blank">02:36:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">whether government should be involved in AGI, on, you know, whether I and Superalignment were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9385" target="_blank">02:36:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">loyal to the company, on, you know, what I was up to during the OpenAI board events, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9390" target="_blank">02:36:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that. And, you know, then they, you know, chatted to a couple of my colleagues,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9395" target="_blank">02:36:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they came back and told me I was fired. And, you know, they'd gone through all of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9398" target="_blank">02:36:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">digital artifacts from the time at OpenAI, you know, messages, docs, and that's when they found,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9403" target="_blank">02:36:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the leak. Yeah. And so anyway, so the main claim they made was this leaking allegation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9408" target="_blank">02:36:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that's what they told employees. They, you know, the security memo. There's a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9414" target="_blank">02:36:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">other allegations they threw in. One thing they said was that I was unforthcoming during the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9419" target="_blank">02:36:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">investigation because I didn't initially remember who I had shared the doc with, the sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9422" target="_blank">02:37:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">preparedness brainstorming doc, only that I had sort of spoken to some external researchers about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9427" target="_blank">02:37:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">these ideas. And, you know, look, the doc was over six months old. You know, I'd spent a day on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9432" target="_blank">02:37:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it was a Google doc I shared with my OpenAI email. It wasn't a screenshot or anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9436" target="_blank">02:37:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was trying to hide. It simply didn't stick because it was such a non-issue. And then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9442" target="_blank">02:37:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">also claimed that I was engaging on policy in a way that they didn't like. And so what they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9447" target="_blank">02:37:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">cited there was that I had spoken to a couple of external researchers, you know, somebody got a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9452" target="_blank">02:37:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">think tank about my view that AGI would become a government project, you know, as we discussed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9456" target="_blank">02:37:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, in fact, I was speaking to lots of sort of people in the field about that at the time. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9460" target="_blank">02:37:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">thought it was a really important thing to think about. Anyway, and so they found, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9464" target="_blank">02:37:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they found a DM that I'd written to, like a friendly colleague, you know, five or six months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9468" target="_blank">02:37:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">ago where I relayed this. And, you know, they cited that. And, you know, I had thought it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9473" target="_blank">02:37:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">well within OpenAI norms to kind of talk about high-level issues on the future of AGI with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9478" target="_blank">02:37:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">external people in the field. So that's what they alleged. That's what happened. You know, I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9485" target="_blank">02:38:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">spoken to kind of a few dozen former colleagues about this, you know, since I think the sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9489" target="_blank">02:38:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">universal reaction is kind of like, you know, that's insane.

You know, I didn't sign the employee letter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9527" target="_blank">02:38:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">during the board events, you know, despite pressure to do so. And you were one of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9532" target="_blank">02:38:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">eight people or something. Yeah, I guess the I think the sort of two senior most people didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9538" target="_blank">02:38:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sign were Andre and yeah. And, you know, I mean, on the letter, by the way, I am by the time on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9546" target="_blank">02:39:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of Monday morning when that letter was going around, I think probably it was appropriate for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9549" target="_blank">02:39:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the board to resign. I think they'd kind of like lost too much credibility and trust with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9553" target="_blank">02:39:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">employees.

I mean, I think one of them was it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9558" target="_blank">02:39:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't call for an independent board. I think it's sort of like basics of corporate governance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9562" target="_blank">02:39:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to have an independent board. Anyway, you know, it's other things, you know, I am in sort of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=9567" target="_blank">02:39:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">discussions.

It's a straight line on the log-log plot.

You know, this is sort of a class, yeah, it's a classic. And, you know, it's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10180" target="_blank">02:49:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the first thing is very easy.

And so, you know, in some sense, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10188" target="_blank">02:49:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a natural story. Now, one objection kind of people then make is like, oh, you know, isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10193" target="_blank">02:49:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it suspicious, right? That like ideas, you know, well, we increased research effort 10X, and ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10198" target="_blank">02:49:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">also just got 10X harder to find. And so it perfectly, you know, equilibrates. And to there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10204" target="_blank">02:50:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I say, you know, it's just, it's an equilibrium. It's an adagis equilibrium, right? So it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10207" target="_blank">02:50:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, isn't it a coincidence that supply equals demand, you know, and the market clears,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10212" target="_blank">02:50:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

So it's, you know, ideas getting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10216" target="_blank">02:50:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how much ideas have gotten harder to find is a function of how much progress you've made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10219" target="_blank">02:50:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, what the overall growth rate has been is a function of how much ideas have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10224" target="_blank">02:50:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">gotten harder to find in ratio to how much you've been able to like increase research effort. What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10228" target="_blank">02:50:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is the sort of growth of log cumulative research effort? So in some sense, I think the story is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10232" target="_blank">02:50:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of like, fairly natural. And you see this, you see this not just economy wide, you see it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10235" target="_blank">02:50:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in kind of experience curve for all sorts of individual technologies. So I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10240" target="_blank">02:50:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">some process like this. I think it's totally plausible that, you know, institutions have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10243" target="_blank">02:50:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">gotten worse by some factor. Obviously, there's some sort of exponent of diminishing returns on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10247" target="_blank">02:50:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">more people, right? So like serial time is better than just parallelizing. But still, I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10252" target="_blank">02:50:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like clearly inputs matter.

This is great. Okay, so a few responses to that. First of all, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10797" target="_blank">02:59:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I totally agree with the kind of like real world bottlenecks type of thing.

And so I think this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10811" target="_blank">03:00:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is part of why the story is that kind of like starts pretty narrow at the thing where you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10814" target="_blank">03:00:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have these bottlenecks.

Okay, first of all, I think the story is sort of like, basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=10942" target="_blank">03:02:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a little bit more continuous, you know, right?

Humans actually, maybe there's you say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11246" target="_blank">03:07:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">well, the fact that these things are way less sample efficient in terms of learning than humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11250" target="_blank">03:07:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">are suggested, there's a lot of room for improvement.

Another perspective is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11254" target="_blank">03:07:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we are just on the wrong path altogether, right?

When I had him on the podcast is that you do go from the fact that after 1776,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11852" target="_blank">03:17:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you go from a regime of negligible economic growth to percent. Yeah. It's really interesting. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11857" target="_blank">03:17:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">shows that, I mean, from the perspective of somebody in the Middle Ages or before. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11862" target="_blank">03:17:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">2% is equivalent to the sort of 10%. Yeah. I guess you're projecting even higher for the economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11867" target="_blank">03:17:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I mean, I think, again, and it's all this stuff, you know, I have a lot of uncertainty,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11871" target="_blank">03:17:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So a lot of the time, I'm trying to kind of tell the modal story. I think it's important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11874" target="_blank">03:17:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to be kind of concrete and visceral.

And I, you know, I have, I have a lot of uncertainty,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11878" target="_blank">03:17:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, over how the 2030s play out. And basically, the thing I know is it's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11882" target="_blank">03:18:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fucking crazy. But, you know, exactly what, you know, where the bottlenecks are, and so on. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11887" target="_blank">03:18:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">think that will be kind of like, so let's talk through the numbers here, you hundreds of millions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11893" target="_blank">03:18:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of AI researchers. So right now, GPD 4.0 Turbo is like 15 bucks for a million tokens outputted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11902" target="_blank">03:18:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and a human thinks 150 tokens a minute, or something. And if you do the math on that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11907" target="_blank">03:18:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's for an hour's worth of human output, you it's like 10 cents or something. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11916" target="_blank">03:18:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">cheaper than a human worker, cheaper than a human. Oh, yeah, I can't do the job. That's right. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11920" target="_blank">03:18:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right. But by the time you're talking about models that are trained on the 10 gigawatt cluster,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11925" target="_blank">03:18:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, then you have something that is four orders of magnitude, more expensive via inference,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11930" target="_blank">03:18:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">three orders of magnitude, something like that. So that's like $100 an hour of labor. And now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11936" target="_blank">03:18:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're having hundreds of millions of such laborers. Is there enough compute to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11941" target="_blank">03:19:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the model that is 1000 times bigger, this kind of labor? Great. Okay, great question. So I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11947" target="_blank">03:19:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">don't think inference costs for sort of frontier models are necessarily going to go up that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11951" target="_blank">03:19:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I mean, one historical data point, but isn't the test time sort of thing that it will go up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11955" target="_blank">03:19:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">even higher? I mean, we're just doing per token, right? And then I'm just saying, you know, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11959" target="_blank">03:19:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">suppose each model token was the same as sort of a human thing at 100 tokens a minute. So it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11963" target="_blank">03:19:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, it'll use more, but the token calculations is already pricing that in. The question is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11969" target="_blank">03:19:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">per token pricing, right? And so like GPT-3 when it launched was like actually more expensive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11975" target="_blank">03:19:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">than GPT-4 now. And so over just like fast increases in capability gains, inference costs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11981" target="_blank">03:19:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">remain constant. That's sort of wild. I think it's worth appreciating. And I think it gestures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11987" target="_blank">03:19:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that sort of an underlying pace of algorithmic progress. I think there's a sort of like more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11992" target="_blank">03:19:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">theoretically grounded way to why inference costs would stay constant. And it's the following story,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=11996" target="_blank">03:19:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So on Chacheli scaling laws, right? Half of the additional compute you allocate to bigger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12002" target="_blank">03:20:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">models and half of it you allocate to more data, right? But also if we go with the sort of basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12007" target="_blank">03:20:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">story of half an order of year more compute and half an order of magnitude a year of algorithmic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12010" target="_blank">03:20:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">progress, you're also kind of like you're saving half an order of magnitude a year. And so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12014" target="_blank">03:20:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of would exactly compensate for making the model bigger. The caveat on that is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12018" target="_blank">03:20:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously not all training efficiencies are also inference efficiencies, you know, a bunch of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12022" target="_blank">03:20:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">time they are separately, you can find inference efficiencies. So I don't know, given this historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12027" target="_blank">03:20:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">trend, given the sort of like, you know, baseline sort of theoretical reason, you know, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12033" target="_blank">03:20:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's not crazy baseline assumption that actually these models, the frontier models are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12037" target="_blank">03:20:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">not necessarily going to get more expensive per token.

Like, okay, that's wild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12043" target="_blank">03:20:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see. We'll see. I mean, the other thing, you know, even if they get like 10x more expensive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12048" target="_blank">03:20:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then you know, you have 10 million instead of 100 million, you know, so it's like, it's not really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12051" target="_blank">03:20:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, like, but okay, so part of the intelligence solution is that each of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12055" target="_blank">03:20:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">has to run experiments that are gbd for size, and the result. So that takes up a bunch of compute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12063" target="_blank">03:21:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, they need to consolidate the results of experiments.

And they're like looking at the Apollo program in the 450s or something. And they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12118" target="_blank">03:21:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, we have some amount of effective jet fuel.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12214" target="_blank">03:23:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on the effect of compute scaling, you know, in some sense, I think it's like people center the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12220" target="_blank">03:23:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">scaling laws because they're easy to explain and the sort of like, why, why is scaling matter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12224" target="_blank">03:23:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The scaling laws like came way after people, at least, you know, like Dario, Ilya realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12228" target="_blank">03:23:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that scaling mattered.

It is strikingly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12322" target="_blank">03:25:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">plausible. I agree. And so I think actually, I mean, the other thing I'll say is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12325" target="_blank">03:25:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I say this 2027 timeline, I think is unlikely, but I do think there's worlds that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=12330" target="_blank">03:25:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like AGI next year.

I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14197" target="_blank">03:56:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people in the PRC will read this.

A lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14213" target="_blank">03:56:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">these takes are kind of old.

I think the other thing is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14224" target="_blank">03:57:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think to be able to manage this challenge, I think much broader swaths of society will need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14233" target="_blank">03:57:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to wake up.

And so I think it's a tough trade-off, but I think the need to wake up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14245" target="_blank">03:57:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">people in the United States, in the sort of Western world, in the democratic coalition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14249" target="_blank">03:57:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is ultimately imperative.

So by the way, on the topic of Germany, we were talking at some point about kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14280" target="_blank">03:58:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">immigration story.

So a couple of years ago, I was in college and I was 20. I was about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14292" target="_blank">03:58:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to turn 21. Yeah.

So until I was eight or nine, I lived in India and then we moved around all over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14302" target="_blank">03:58:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the place. But because of the backlog for Indians. Yeah. The green card backlog. Yeah. We've been in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14310" target="_blank">03:58:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the queue for like decades. Even though you came at eight, you're still on the H1B. Yeah. And when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14315" target="_blank">03:58:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you're 21, you get kicked off the queue and you had to restart the process. So I'm on my dad's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14320" target="_blank">03:58:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">my dad's a doctor and I'm on his H1B as a dependent.

And so I also had the experience that my dad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14333" target="_blank">03:58:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

They have to prove that him as a doctor is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14337" target="_blank">03:58:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't get native talent.

So where can you not get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14342" target="_blank">03:59:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">native?

So if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14347" target="_blank">03:59:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">lucky you're in this. And they had to prove that they can't get native talent, which means like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14349" target="_blank">03:59:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for him, I'm like, we lived in North Dakota for three years, West Virginia for three years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14353" target="_blank">03:59:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Maryland, West Texas.

As I turn 21,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14358" target="_blank">03:59:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll be like on this lottery.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14385" target="_blank">03:59:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">remember I kind of just, um, I, uh, I was in a dazed through finals because I had like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=14390" target="_blank">03:59:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I had just occurred to me and I was really like anxious about it.

Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15126" target="_blank">04:12:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the thing you have to be resistant to is like, you have to be able to resist and get, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15129" target="_blank">04:12:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">one or a couple or a few kind of individual calls.

And, um, so anyway, that's pretty critical. You have to get timing. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15141" target="_blank">04:12:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I do think in general that the sort of sequence of bets on the way to AGI is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15145" target="_blank">04:12:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty critical. And I think a thing people underrate. So, all right. I mean, yeah. So like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15150" target="_blank">04:12:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">where does the story start? Right. So like, obviously the sort of only bet over the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15154" target="_blank">04:12:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">year was NVIDIA. Um, and, um, you know, it's obvious now very few people did it. Um, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15161" target="_blank">04:12:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is sort of also, you know, classic debate I and a friend had with another colleague of ours where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15165" target="_blank">04:12:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this colleague was really into TSM, you know, TSMC.

And also like NVIDIA, there's just a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15172" target="_blank">04:12:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">idiosyncratic risk, right?

That was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15176" target="_blank">04:12:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">basically right. But sort of only NVIDIA had the AI beta, right? Because only NVIDIA was kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15180" target="_blank">04:13:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like large fraction AI.

So even though there's going to be a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15188" target="_blank">04:13:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">doublings of AI, not going to make that big of an impact. All right. So it's sort of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15192" target="_blank">04:13:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the only place to find the AI beta basically was NVIDIA for a while.

So now TSM is like, you know, 20% AI by like 27 or something is what they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&t=15202" target="_blank">04:13:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">saying.
