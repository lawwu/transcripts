But what if agents themselves were exposed as MCP servers? In that case if you connect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">an agent as an MCP server to an MCP client then that client can invoke that agent it could coordinate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">across multiple agents it could orchestrate similar to the patterns I showed you the same as it does today with any other MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Also you could do multi-agent communication also over MCP so agents can then invoke other agents. In this diagram</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you kind of see an MCP client that's connected to regular MCP servers like github, slack, linear etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's also connected to agent servers and these agent servers in turn can connect to other MCP servers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just over the base MCP protocol and so then you can kind of get multi-agent collaboration and coordination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for free. The MCP client can invoke in this case MCP agent server A which in turn may invoke other MCP servers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or it may even invoke other agents and as a result you basically have this network of agents that may get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">activated from a single command that a user sends through Claude, Cursor or some other MCP client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are the benefits of this? If you expose agents as MCP servers the first thing you get is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">composable agents. Like I mentioned you have complex multi-agent systems that can operate over the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">base protocol that everybody's adopting. We know MCP is going to be a common standard and so we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">safely build on top of it. The second thing is you get platform agnostic agents. You can build these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">agents once and then you can reuse them anywhere that is MCP compatible. And finally you get scalable agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If you run agent workflows on dedicated infrastructure then you can kind of separate that where the agent is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">where the agent compute is happening from the client that is being used to invoke the agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that gives enormous benefits in terms of you know scalability, performance and durability as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've talked about agents as async workflows. What I mean by that is that agents can be paused and resumed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They need to await on human feedback in some cases. They may fail and then they need to be retried.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Agents could be triggered or scheduled. It's not just a chat application that is agentic. You could have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a webhook that triggers an agent or a cron job that you know triggers an agent every every day or every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">week or something. And so the right way to model all of this is as asynchronous workflows. And so that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what we do in MCP agent as well. We use temporal as the durable execution backend to the compute or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">orchestration of agent execution. So let's do a quick demo to show what all of this looks like just to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">make it more real. So the first thing you'll see here is I have this task that I want to build an agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for. In this case it's a fairly complex task. I'm asking an agent to load the student's short story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">from a markdown file which is this. But we assume this is a student's short story. And then I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to generate a report. Basically grade this short story across proofreading, factual and logical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">consistency, as well as style adherence. And by the way for the style adherence I want to use the APA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">style guide from this URL. And finally I want to write that graded report to the markdown file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">gradedreport.md. So the agent that I've created here is actually going to do a couple of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But first I connect it to a couple of MCP servers. I have the fetch MCP server which can connect to URLs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and get fetch data from the internet. And I have the file system MCP server to interact with the file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">system. So right off the bat because of MCP I don't need to interact with the file system or interact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with the internet and fetch URLs in a unique way. It's all over the same base protocol and it's all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">exposed as tools from these MCP servers. And then I define a couple of these agents where I have a finder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">agent that can fetch content from the internet or from disk. I have a writer agent that can write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff to disk. I have a proofreader, a fact checker, a style enforcer, and then I have an orchestrator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Recall from you know those agent patterns I showed you. This one will basically generate a plan given the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">task and it will use it will orchestrate these agents that I've defined in a way that it sees fit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So this workflow is about like a hundred lines of code and that it's still doing something fairly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sophisticated. So if we run this we're going to use temporal to run this and so I'll kick this off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and you'll see that the worker job has triggered and it's going to start executing. Workflow UI you see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's a workflow that's been triggered and the first thing you'll see that the agent does is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually generates a plan. So over here you see that it's broken down the task I gave it the fairly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">complex multi-step task into a series of steps that it's going to do. First it's going to load the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">student short story and it's going to use the finder agent for that. In turn the finder agent is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to use the file system MCP server. Then it's going to analyze the short story using the proofreader,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact checker, the style enforcer and finally it's going to generate the graded report dot markdown file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and write with the writer agent. And so then you see that the agent is executing. There's a whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow graph. This can fail at any step and can be retried. It can be terminated. It can await for human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback. And here you see that it already completed. So we should have a graded report dot markdown file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that's generated for us. And if we see what's in it, you can kind of see that it did what I asked it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">factual consistency, APA style guide. It was able to do all this correctly. Lastly, you can actually do the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thing now by exposing this agent as an MCP server. You can connect it to an MCP client like cloud desktop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Here I have the agent exposed as an MCP server and you see that it exposes itself as workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I gave it the same short story here and I asked it to grade it use with this basic agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what it does is it runs the workflow. It gives the input of the story and then it pulls for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the status of that workflow job because note that the agent is executing in a different execution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">environment. I could close my cloud desktop and come back and it can check the status of that workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and get me the results at a later date. And so the asynchronous nature of this work of this agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">helps me kind of, you know, kick off agent tasks from anywhere. And then it like once the agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">completes, it presents me the report over here. And so I can still use this agent in a chat bot environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I can run this agent anywhere that is MCP compatible.
