Did you at all deal with that? And kind of how did you work your way through, you know, that time going from, you know, stardom to kind of being away from the spotlight?</p><p>Was it hard for you at all? - There's no doubt it's an adjustment, right? I was fortunate. I got to play football for a long time. Look, you're always gonna miss your teammates. And around playoff time, Super Bowl time, you always miss it a little bit then. I was just grateful for the time that I had.</p><p>So I guess in the second chapter, I didn't really look for that. You know, I didn't miss, you know, being on the field because I was grateful for the time that I got to do it. Our kids had just maybe turned five years old at the time. So they're getting into school.</p><p>That was a nice kind of timing to kind of be able to sort of dive into their lives and everything. And so it's been a pretty good transition.
