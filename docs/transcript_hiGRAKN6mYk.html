One obviously of poor metabolic health. And this is a health-forward population. So we're seeing over 90% have abnormal lipid tests. 96% have small LDL, which is not tested on a regular cholesterol test, which is the more risky cholesterol particle.</p><p>We're seeing over 50% have IAPOB, which is probably the most important cholesterol test that your doctor doesn't test. You're typically 50%. We're seeing over 40% have levels of inflammation. 67% have nutritional deficiencies and things that really make a difference in how you feel, like mental health and energy and immunity, like vitamin D and iron and the B vitamins, like B12 folate and B6.</p><p>And it's kind of shocking, but America is just sick. So all of us are struggling. And I think people just don't know how deficient they are in things. So I had a woman the other day, it was like she was a young, healthy woman, but she was always getting sick.</p><p>And her vitamin D level is 26, which is very, very low. So I think these are simple things you can find out about, easy to fix and tune up and optimize your health with.</p></div></div></body></html>
