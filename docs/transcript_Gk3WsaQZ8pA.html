If i don't get hold of this technology and build up a group within my company that knows how to do it then i'm gonna be left behind so they start investing in the technology without any evidence that it actually works to solve their problem on the assumption that if they don't be left behind that is this there's a potential gain here we can't afford to lose it and then they start to hear stories.</p><p>All this other company you know they tried six times and it just fails right didn't work for their problem then. They start to lose faith very quickly all those companies that haven't yet had a success can switch overnight from thinking it's essential to we better get out of this otherwise we're gonna look foolish.</p><p>So that's what happened with the expert system in the late eighties which is a shame because by then we already had the technological solutions that would have alleviated a lot of those difficulties.</p></div></div></body></html>
