And it's either either you have a never ending cycle of of transfers of income from the unlanded to the landed. And eventually the unlanded will not put up with that. There was a real chance in the 19th century, at the end of the 19th century of America going full on socialist or communist.</p><p>And the only thing that saved us was of course, the automobile and the automobile kicked the can down another generation, another couple generations, right. And it came at the cost of sprawl. And that made everyone feel like we had solved the issue. But the costs of sprawl are enormous in terms of pollution, and poor land use.</p><p>Just look at Houston right now, right? But now we've come at the end of that frontier. And now we're at the same question. It's you see this resurgent interest in leftism in America. And that's not a coincidence, right? Because the rent is too damn high and poor people and young people feel really shoved out of the promise and social contract that was given to their parents.</p><p>they're jealous of it and they're wondering where it went.</p></div></div></body></html>
