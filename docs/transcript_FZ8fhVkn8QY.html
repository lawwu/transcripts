You run into the burning building and you buy. And more people have done that, I think, than ever before. And I think that's a great thing, but you do wonder if it makes it so these cycles just play out differently than it didn't pass.</p><p>Yeah, and people are like, I don't want to invest because I could just wait for the next crash because they're happening so fast. Whereas I think earlier in my investing career, sure, when 2008 happened, I didn't have money to invest. But it wasn't a buying opportunity for me, but I didn't have this belief that there would be another one so soon.</p><p>I just slowly kept putting whatever I could in. And now a part of me is like, gosh, if these swings are so great, should I just be keeping every amount of savings on the sideline in cash? I just constantly time the short crashes, which just both feels like a good idea and also feels like a terrible idea at the same time.</p></div></div></body></html>
