at Stanford School of Medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">My guest today is Dr. Kaye Tye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Dr. Kaye Tye is a professor of neuroscience at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">She did her training at MIT and at Stanford and is currently an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">She is a highly curated group of individuals who are incentivized to do high-risk, high-reward work and pioneer new areas of biological study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Throughout her career, Dr. Kaye Tye has made fundamental breakthroughs into our understanding of the brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">including demonstrating that a brain area called the amygdala, which most people associate with fear and threat detection,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.500</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Her current work focuses on various aspects of social interaction, including what happens when we feel lonely or isolated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed, today Kaye Tye will tell us about her discovery of so-called loneliness neurons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">neurons that give us that sense that we are not being fulfilled from our social interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">She also describes a phenomenon she discovered called social homeostasis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">which is our sense that we are experiencing enough, not enough, or just enough social interaction irrespective of whether or not we are an introvert or an extrovert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We also talk about social hierarchies and social rank, how people and animals tear out into so-called alphas and betas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.500</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:01:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think everyone will find that discussion especially interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talk about the role of social media and online interactions and why despite extensive interaction with many, many individuals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">those social media and online interactions can often leave us feeling deprived in specific ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We talk about the neurochemical, the neural circuit and some of the hormonal aspects of social interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a discussion that by the end will have you thinking far more deeply about what is a social interaction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and why certain social interactions leave us feeling so good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Others feeling sort of meh,</span></div><div

interactions can often leave us feeling quite depleted, even depressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a conversation central to mental illness and the understanding of things like depression and anxiety, PTSD and isolation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a conversation central to mental health and in order to build healthy social interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</span></div><div

zero cost to consumer information about science</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.700</a></span> | <span

value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so valence is just asking about how your brain responds to things that are good or bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What are neurons that might respond similarly to things that are good and bad?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, those might be importance neurons rather than positive or negative valence neurons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I think it's a it's just a term that that signifies that next step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we walk into, say, a novel environment, do you think that our amygdala's are active</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and really trying to figure out whether or not an environment,</span></div><div

check that box first in order to be able to do other things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Is, you know, is this business of determining valence and the role of the amygdala in that kind of the first gate</span></div><div

environment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">For instance, you showed up here today and you mentioned, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.100</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:13:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you walked in and presumably you were taking in the new environment, meeting some new people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We had a little discussion about caffeine, a little discussion about alcohol,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and presumably because you and I know one another, you felt safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I would hope so. But presumably the amygdala is always performing this role,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">even if we have some prior knowledge about something, just figuring out, am I safe here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Where are the exits? Where are the entrances? Who's here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What's their story? Do you think all of that is operating?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And do you think it's always conscious or is it largely unconscious to us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so there's a few different questions there. First, I want to address the question about novelty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I want to come back to this, the other issue of conscious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way the amygdala works is its job is to assign meaning to anything that could have motivational significance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if it's a brand new thing, we're paying attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We're seeing if it mattered. Did it matter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think anything that's novel, even if we don't know what it means,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a loud sound you've never heard before, even if it signifies nothing of motivational significance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the first few times that you're presented with it, you'll get an amygdala response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So you see this in the lab, play the tone for the first time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and then there's a response that rapidly decays when the tone doesn't end up predicting anything that the animal can detect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or human, is this also true in humans?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is true in humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're the type of person that puts your phone on do not disturb versus has it on vibrate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and you know, sometimes it's always vibrating and it's just, it vibrates all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas I put my phone on do not disturb and so when someone else's phone rings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very startling to me, but they don't even notice because that's just the sound the phone makes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes it all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it has to do with how many times you're presented with it and it's a startle response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first few times that you are presented with a stimulus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the amygdala will respond and then it decays very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then only if that stimulus predicts something important or something rewarding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or punishing, then will it begin to respond again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like you're giving everything novel a chance to tell you in one trial,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">in single trial learning, if something's going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think a fire alarm is a great example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, fire alarm goes off, you're instantly, you know, you're looking around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is there anything happening, even just people rushing out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's the salient thing that you're going to respond to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, if you have a lot of fire drills, then you might respond differently after a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's the habituation component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned that the amygdala will respond to a novel stimulus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it predicts something interesting, then other things happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll talk about those. If not, the amygdala stops responding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And you said something really important, which is that the amygdala will respond to something that is predicting reward or punishment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think most people don't realize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, I think a lot of early career neurobiologists don't realize that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that the amygdala is not just involved in fear and punishment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we talk about the amygdala, presumably we're talking about the amygdala complex, a bunch of other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So is it true that there are neurons in the amygdala complex that predict reward and others that predict fear and punishment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So as a graduate student, I worked on a part of the amygdala called the basolateral amygdala.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's still a complex within the broader amygdala.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">This brain region is cortical-like in that it's mostly glutamatergic neurons with some GABAergic neurons mixed in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">but without the same structure that the cortex has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I studied the amygdala in the context of reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I found essentially that when you induce plasticity, you get a synaptic strengthening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When you -- when animals learn things, amygdala neurons fire in response to cues that predict rewards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was coming into the context of a field that had shown that this happens with fear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this became -- I remember the very first time I gave a presentation at a scientific conference,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I was a junior graduate student.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I was given a 10-minute talk at the, you know, inaugural Amygdala Gordon Research Conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Many famous professors were speaking, and there were two talks about the amygdala and reward, and I was one of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the response to the talk was just, how is this possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">How can -- how can the amygdala -- how can -- how can you get the same readout for reward and fear?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And really, it came to be there's two possibilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's more possibilities, but the main two possibilities are, number one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that the amygdala wasn't specific for fear at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It just responds to anything important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's important, it responds, period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The other possibility is that the amygdala is sending --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">has different neurons that respond to positive and negative predictive stimuli,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and sends this information to different downstream targets to respond differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, I respond differently to a reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I walk towards it, I consume it, a punishment, I'm avoiding it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, clearly, the behaviors are diametrically opposed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, to me, it seemed very possible, at least, that there was a divergence point, and maybe this could be it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we just did some very simple experiments when I first started my lab to trace the projection targets of amygdala neurons and record.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1147"

when you look at them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you do see that there are projections that come from the amygdala that are predominantly encoding either reward or fear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's many different projections, and, you know, this is just the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But this was a time when it was a novel concept to even think that neurons from one region</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">could have completely different functions going to different downstream targets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">now seems totally obvious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's hundreds and hundreds of papers showing it now, but at the time, it was difficult to get this work published</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's just not how people thought about information moving through the brain, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think, first of all, such important work and so wonderful to be early in the phase of recasting how the brain works,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.200</a></span> | <span

think most people in the general public still think amygdala fear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And clearly, it's able to signal reward and punishment, as you discovered and are now pointing out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm curious, does the amygdala have a direct line to some of the organs of the body that can change our bodily activation state,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.200</a></span>

target="_blank">00:20:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think most of us experience fear and reward as both in our head, in our brains, but also of the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Great question, great question.</span></div><div

working model, which may, you know, is not necessarily the final word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would say that I think the amygdala complex as we're discussing it, these 13 subnuclei that reside, you know, in the temporal lobe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they are important for assigning importance, but they're not important for producing the actual autonomic arousal that we associate with panic or fear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason I say this is there's a famous case study patient, SM, who has bilateral damage to her amygdala and, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">no responses to emotional faces, no responses to fearful stimuli, but if you -- capable of having the panic response due to low --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to suffocation, associated with suffocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's still the ability to produce that panic and arousal response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just not the cognitive evaluation of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's what we think the amygdala is doing, is assigning that -- it does receive information from the rest of the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There are, for example, ghrelin receptors in the amygdala, things that can sense hunger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've done some work looking at this, kind of inspired by -- I'm not sure if you're familiar with this study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a controversial study, Danziger 2011, but where the Supreme Court judges -- they looked at Supreme Court judge rulings on parole decisions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">across the day relative to meal breaks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see, right after -- it's like breakfast, you know, 90 percent, everybody's getting parole, everybody's getting out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and then it just drops to 10 percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there's lunch, then we're back to 80 percent, and then it just precipitously drops to single digits again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the judges are changing the leniency of their rulings depending on how well-fed they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there are counterarguments to this, but that is strongly what the data suggests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it is not a controlled study, it is just a striking correlation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not a completely novel concept, the hangry phenomenon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure -- I don't know, everybody's different, I certainly experience it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But we think that when you are getting strong signals from the body, for example, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the amygdala is going to be able to detect a lot of different homeostatic inputs even though we haven't --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't have evidence for that yet, but for specifically energy balance, when you're hungry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your amygdala can detect it perhaps through ghrelin receptors or other, you know, mechanisms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what we see is that in that food -- after one day of food deprivation for mice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see this shift in the balance between the positive valence encoding projection neurons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and the negative valence encoding projection neurons.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The negative projection neurons, you know, can silence the reward projection ones, which makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If I need to run away from this predator, you know, I can't worry about eating this food right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I'm in a near starvation-like state, which for mice, they have very high metabolism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so one day without food is a really big deal, they only last a few days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So at this point, they are kicking into survival mode where actually getting food becomes the greater need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll see animals, you know, hunting in ways they normally wouldn't hunt when they're really desperate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this mode of food deprivation shifts things so that the reward pathway actually has stronger power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to influence and silence the fear pathway than before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It can take what we normally think of as a priority list.</span></div><div

reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if food and acquiring food is critical to survival, it can invert all that, is what you're saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1489"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's something that we're looking at right now and thinking about how specific is this to food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this true for lots of different things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What about exercise, other stressors that are, you know, potentially more positive?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The amygdala is able to detect a lot of different signals from the environment, and we're not sure how all of that gets in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think one of the detection of the environment has been, you know, really well worked out in terms of our basic sensory modalities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But think about the things that really affect your emotions day to day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">At least for me, as a human in this society, the things that affect my emotions most day to day are almost entirely social interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Very subtle ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Ones that don't seem to threaten my life or safety.</span></div><div class="c"><span

have the greatest bearing, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on my emotional evaluation and my emotional bandwidth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And what is that? How do we detect that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we assemble this information, apply all the nuance, you know, put on the onion layers of social programming to come out with whatever, you know, I interpret this gesture to mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty incredible.</span></div><div

been sliding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Such an interesting area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's drill into it a bit and to put it in context, maybe talk about social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So on social media, whether or not it's Instagram or X, those seem to be the two major platforms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not on TikTok.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">People say stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they say positive things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they say negative things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they say things that are sort of neutral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1609" target="_blank">00:26:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it seems to me that nowadays, if one is on these social media platforms, that we are, we've sort of crowdsourced this phenomenon of social interaction in a way that we hadn't before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

have social media nowadays, it seems, or on there in some ways, that we've placed ourselves in the center of an arena, which we have a ton of incoming input.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there does seem to be a cohort of people who seem to like the friction of combat or kind of, let's just call it high friction interactions or moderate friction interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They like to argue, they like to parse ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So have you ever looked at social media, in your own mind, looked at social media through the lens of amygdala filtering or through the lens of neural circuit filtering and kind of wondered what's going on there that someone without your in-depth knowledge of these brain circuitries would not think to look at that landscape?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe we could just do that now as a kind of playful experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of people ask me about social media from the context of, is this social contact meaningful, is this positive, does this count, does this help you not feel lonely?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, I don't know the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We haven't done that particular study yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know of that specific study having been performed, but my prediction is that it's not going to do much because I believe that a key component of what I would consider social contact heavily depends on having some interbrain synchrony, some interaction that is synchronous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think with social media, sometimes there can be an engaging dialogue that plays out in near real time, but generally speaking, it's asynchronous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You're looking at things that have happened that you're not a part

things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It happened in Australia

asynchronous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Asynchronous like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not experiencing things at

experience in terms of having that bond necessarily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've never actually been asked about how the amygdala processes social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess I think what happens is the amygdala is just responding to stimuli.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's sending up bottom-up signals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a caricature of bottom-up and top-down processing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's give an example that I'm walking down the street and all of a sudden I hear a really ferocious dog barking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I get super scared and then I realize, okay, there's a fence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the amygdala heard the dog barking and there's a dog barking and I'm freaking out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then my prefrontal cortex realizes there's the fence and it looks very sturdy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This fence looks stable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm relaxing and I'm resuming my walking normally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's sort of the dance that our brain is doing when we have top-down and bottom-up information that we're trying to stay focused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, I think when I'm on social media, there's so many stimuli that are evoking responses and to be completely transparent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1856" target="_blank">00:30:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know this is not something that everybody else does or can't do or is necessarily what's best for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I work very hard to control input from the top down in terms of I really, really limit the amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I basically don't check email or go on social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say I'm on social media or email less than one hour per week, basically per week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All I have to say to that is congratulations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.200</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:31:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But as a fellow professor, email once a week, I've heard of people scheduling their times for email responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But once a week, that is awesome.</span></div><div

filter out what's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But otherwise, I just whenever I do my own email, I say yes to all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I make all these plans and then I have too many trips and I'm responding, fragmented, fragmented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just overcommitting and I think I know my limits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it's difficult for me to be in my amygdala mode responding to stimuli and letting my prefrontal cortex do its thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've set some very heavy prefrontal cortical selected limits of the input I put in so that my brain can function and be clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.200</a></span> | <span

have epiphanies if there's all this clutter of like writing this person back and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, tweet, tweet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just, you know, trash out, wipe, squeegee, squeegee the brain down so that we can actually grow something beautiful and new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.200</a></span> | <span

contact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's AG1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut, but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, gut health is critical for proper brain functioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are a number of things in AG1, including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from whole foods or at least in sufficient quantities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens and critical micronutrients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So anytime somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement, what that supplement should be, I tell them AG1.</span></div><div

the body that are involved in mental health, physical health and performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2176"

making some effort toward reducing the amount of incoming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as you said, controlling the top-down inputs to the amygdala but also to the rest of the brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

tremendous service by sharing that somebody as successful as you does this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2255"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Could we, by extension, say that many people, since billions of people are on social media,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">are likely triggering the

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">by sort of just making themselves freely available to the thoughts and words and impulses of others?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, to me it seems the answer would be yes, but I'd like to know what you think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think--and there's something to be said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's definitely been moments where I've gone deep into social media and spent more time in a certain burst that is isolated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that there's a lot to be learned from social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually to bring it back to one point you mentioned earlier, on social media sometimes people just want accolades</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and sometimes there's a lot of friction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the reasons I stay on social media, even though I'm making this big effort to sort of declutter my consciousness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2317" target="_blank">00:38:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is because of that feedback, especially when, you know, for someone like you, I imagine this has got to be super true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And even for me at a certain point in my career, it just felt like people don't want to tell me bad news to my face as much anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody's so positive all the time and, you know, what are they really thinking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And social media allows you the protection of anonymity to say what you really think without consequence, essentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2351" target="_blank">00:39:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so on the one hand, the consequence-free nature of being able to just say things can be very dangerous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but at the same time, for me, I really value just being able to receive it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm, you know, I'm a big girl. I can filter out what I want when I get all the inputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I don't receive the inputs, sometimes it's hard to learn from the feedback I'm not getting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So even sometimes feedback's given in a not very nice way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I can still create a model for someone else that has this perspective that I can take with me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and that can be another perspective I can honor easily in the future because I have this theory of mind for someone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Someone would get upset about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that's something that could be harmful to people who are, you know, have this theory of mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's super valuable from that perspective and that's why I continue to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Great. Yeah, I really applaud that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I always read my teaching evals because they're anonymous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, I do wonder, you know, what grade the different people who gave different evals, you know, got.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know that information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I sometimes wonder, do they attend the class or are they just angry they didn't do well on the exam?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2428" target="_blank">00:40:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But that really represents the small fraction of feedback that I'm that I wonder about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of it that's valuable to me is the, hey, you know, liked the course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2439" target="_blank">00:40:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but these parts really sucked, Professor Huberman, or this part was completely unclear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or completely hated the way you blank blank and blanked because that feedback is something I can really work with to improve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think course evals are are similar to what you're describing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's value there.</span></div><div

then ignore the negative feedback and write those people off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">then I don't think I could improve as a teacher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I always encourage comments and feedback and suggestions in the YouTube comments for this podcast for that reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.200</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it sounds like you've been doing all of these things naturally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually, since I've had

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The sitting across the table, having a coffee with somebody, taking a walk with

know about the value of social interaction at the level of sort of core biological needs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like at the level of neural circuits and maybe even hormones?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you know, most people have heard of oxytocin, they think they love hormone, but there's so much more there for people to understand and know about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, how important is this thing that we call social interaction?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And how bad do things get when we're not getting the right kinds of social interaction?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think this is a great question, and I'm glad that it's become something that has been recognized at a more global and national scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Just the importance of having social support in our lives for our wellbeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But social isolation or even just perceived loneliness has immense health consequences for all social species.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So shortened lifespan, increased mood disorders, increased actually morbidity and mortality for diseases like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the mortality for diseases like cancer or heart

target="_blank">00:45:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think understanding how each of those processes is happening, those mechanisms are far from being worked out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But the correlational evidence is undeniable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We're now taking this into the lab really for the first time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so something so simple as social isolation, how come we don't know way more about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm someone who stumbled into the field of social isolation by accident prior to the pandemic.</span></div><div class="c"><span

gaping hole in our knowledge as a neuroscience community about social isolation really comes from Harry Harlow's work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This original work of maternal separation that was undeniably cruel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It caused irreparable damage to these baby monkeys and they never recovered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.200</a></span> | <span

So they're very famous experiments where they separated baby monkeys from their moms and then had either a wire sort of thing holding a bottle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, OK, what do you miss most about the mom? Is it the wire? Is it the food or is it the comfort?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they had so they had a wire thing with with a milk bottle versus, you know, blankets and cuddly soft things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And and the baby monkeys would go to the cuddly soft thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, a blanket is not a replacement for a mother. Nobody's saying that it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And through these experiments, there was extended maternal separation and it was deemed cruel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2838" target="_blank">00:47:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There was permanent irreparable damage when you when you rehouse these monkeys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They never re-socialized normally. They had lots of different mental and physical health problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think in humans, we know that, you know, solitary confinement is considered torture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, social isolation is a difficult thing to study in in a lot of conditions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we stumbled onto it by complete accident through working with a postdoc, a former postdoc in my lab, Jillian Matthews, who was a graduate student doing an experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It was just trying to figure out if these dopamine neurons would also respond to cocaine the way VTA, these sorry, these ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons were known to respond to cocaine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Wanted to see if these other dopamine neurons respond to cocaine. So sort of a incremental study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2888" target="_blank">00:48:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you do these cocaine studies, you inject the animal with cocaine or saline and then leave the naive animal in the cage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you take brain slices, record from the neurons and look at the synaptic strengths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, the expected outcome sort of was that these dopamine neurons would be similar to other dopamine neurons that showed in long lasting potentiation after a single dose of cocaine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But what happened instead was that, yes, there was potentiation of the cocaine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also potentiation in the saline animals relative to the naive group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was a huge puzzle. What was this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2925" target="_blank">00:48:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turned out through many, many different experiments that it's actually because when you inject animals with cocaine, you're separating them from the group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I felt crazy. And this is what the way people do the experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So you inject them with saline, you separate them. The naive animals just stay there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So with their other litter mates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I see. So the control group, the saline control group is actually a social isolation condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2949" target="_blank">00:49:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So by accident, this control group that didn't make sense was how we stumbled onto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=2954" target="_blank">00:49:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So then we tried a novel cage.

Are you more careful or discerning about who you spend your time with?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I ask this because, you know, there's so many examples for me in the neuroscience literature where, you know, I learned something new about how the brain works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=3151" target="_blank">00:52:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, oh, yeah, you know, it makes a lot of sense why my sleep isn't great.

Does that have you thinking, you know, after a few days of managing the lab with which, as you point out, you have a very large lab, lots of social interaction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's work context, social interaction. Does that, has that led you to think, hey, you know, we should go out to dinner as a lab or I should spend time with somebody who's not in science</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=3222" target="_blank">00:53:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or I should spend time by myself because I've had too much social interaction.

How this information perhaps has shaped some of your choices.

How could I? It's not my lab studies, but, you know, I think that there's a natural sort of empathy if one is a healthy, empathic person to seeing a member of our own species and hopefully also to observing the members of other species, you know, experiencing some discomfort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4748" target="_blank">01:19:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't like that, nor should we.

I mean, I'm not here to diagnose sociopathy, but if that doesn't evoke at least some sort of response of like, oh, gosh, like what I wouldn't do to remove that pain, that their pain is your pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4777" target="_blank">01:19:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Empathy.

And so I suppose that's why. So do you think that there that we are asymmetrically wired for this empathic attunement?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4861" target="_blank">01:21:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Can we observe that in other animals? I realize this might not be squarely in the wheelhouse of what your lab is focusing on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4867" target="_blank">01:21:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think it relates enough to the topics that we're covering today that just, you know, if you'd like to speculate on what might be going on there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4875" target="_blank">01:21:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I can definitely speculate something that we think about a lot. But again, you know, there's some there's some level of this, which is semantics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4885" target="_blank">01:21:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think of empathy as being defined as being able to understand another animal's emotion and also taking it on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4893" target="_blank">01:21:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think something that's a little bit different than emotional contagion. Right. I see a panic. I'm in a group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4899" target="_blank">01:21:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the same thing as as as empathy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4905" target="_blank">01:21:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But these often used in sort of certain contexts, like feeling sorry for someone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4909" target="_blank">01:21:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's maybe different for feeling happy for someone. And this is something I was just talking about with one of my graduate students the other day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4916" target="_blank">01:21:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is there is there an asymmetry in empathy for positive and negative? Or is it just what we've studied?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4924" target="_blank">01:22:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easier to study this. So there's a number of you know, we don't know the answer, but I guess another conceptual framework to put out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4931" target="_blank">01:22:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not saying it's correct. It's, I think, just a good tool for debate. But it's not so much that there's good people and bad people and that good people are empathic and bad people aren't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4944" target="_blank">01:22:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's quite so simple. I guess the way I think about it is whether you view this other social agent as having aligned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4953" target="_blank">01:22:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Goals or agendas as you or are they adversarial? So if they're if they're in your alliance, whatever that means, broadly defined versus adversarial, you would have a different feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4965" target="_blank">01:22:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it's you see this. I guess I was just I was watching this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4969" target="_blank">01:22:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, this is just sort of oversharing. But this is a podcast, not a primary research journal. So I can just say things right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4975" target="_blank">01:22:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I watch some trash TV sometimes. And, you know, these reality competition shows where it's like then you vote the two best friends into elimination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4982" target="_blank">01:23:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have to they have to eliminate each other wildly sadistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4986" target="_blank">01:23:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, then they're best friends and they like like they, you know, and then it's basically mutually exclusive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4992" target="_blank">01:23:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Either you can care about your friend and feel bad not wanting to send them home or.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=4997" target="_blank">01:23:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You you kick it, you just you know, you it's game time and you you you compete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5002" target="_blank">01:23:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can see different individuals wrestling with these two brain states and and how to like what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5008" target="_blank">01:23:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But they are essentially, you know, my my my speculation is that viewing someone as a competitor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5016" target="_blank">01:23:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And. They're an adversary. They are standing in the way of me getting what I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5022" target="_blank">01:23:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You love if he goes down, it's like inversely correlated to empathy if you are viewed as a competitor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5027" target="_blank">01:23:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So things that would contribute to you creating a model or a social agent, it is an adversary as opposed to a potential ally is really what it's going to come down to, to the degree that you feel empathy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5040" target="_blank">01:24:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like you the second someone you realize someone's out to get you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5044" target="_blank">01:24:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">No empathy.

But if there were. Unattended to toys at the dog park, he was going to pick them up and he put them right in front of himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5270" target="_blank">01:27:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was down San Diego and he'd sit with them right in front of him.

But another dog would come and try and take one of those toys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5281" target="_blank">01:28:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And he would get these giant mitts and he would just, boom, stamp it out and drag it back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5286" target="_blank">01:28:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it seems that there are these very primitive circuits about resource allocation and protection of resources that in the absence of understanding that there's a much bigger landscape, like Costello eventually figured out, like Tug's a fun game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=5302" target="_blank">01:28:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Although most dogs couldn't play Tug with him.

There are certain people who could not and should not take psychedelics because it would be genuinely unsafe for them psychologically, especially young people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=6995" target="_blank">01:56:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's my disclaimer.

I think I wrote my undergraduate thesis about it's about hallucinations produced by psychedelics, psychotic breaks and REM sleep and schizophrenia, just comparing what is the common thread when our brain creates a reality that is not objectively there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7021" target="_blank">01:57:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And psychedelics, of course, is a way that we can experience that and remember and recall in a way that's very difficult with REM sleep and sometimes with psychotic breaks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7034" target="_blank">01:57:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, schizophrenia is not something that you can transiently give yourself and have that experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7039" target="_blank">01:57:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think having the ability to move into other brain states is what makes it so attractive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7046" target="_blank">01:57:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the other component is the plasticity. You can you can have an experience and perhaps the firsthand experience is you have an epiphany that you take with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7059" target="_blank">01:57:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's life changing. And, you know, your life habits are completely different for a long lasting way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7066" target="_blank">01:57:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">After this singular experience is is kind of one of the things that makes it so different from all of the other therapeutic treatments that we've got or most of the other ones, I'd say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7078" target="_blank">01:57:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for me, you know, right now there's a lot of work going on exploring psychedelics as a therapy for various different conditions, disease states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7088" target="_blank">01:58:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's great. I think it's really important work. I'm glad a lot is being done on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7093" target="_blank">01:58:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my focus is is to turn over some rocks that might not have been turned over yet and just to get really down at a quantitative, rigorous mathematical level of what is a hallucination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7108" target="_blank">01:58:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, when I asked this question, what is a hallucination? I'm interested in the actual cellular mechanisms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7116" target="_blank">01:58:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we just, you know, we think about neurons having signal to noise and neuromodulation as changing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7123" target="_blank">01:58:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we just changing the signal to noise ratio and then pattern completing all the noise? And that's what a hallucination is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7129" target="_blank">01:58:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We just, you know, take that. We're just reinterpreting noise and putting sort of existing maps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7135" target="_blank">01:58:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything's fitting to existing mold or map that we've already got that then appears as some hallucination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7144" target="_blank">01:59:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is and, you know, maybe doesn't have to be a hallucination. There's also obviously some various different thresholds of the psychedelic experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7152" target="_blank">01:59:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But all these clinical statements, this human self-reported.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7158" target="_blank">01:59:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Qualitative descriptions of the psychedelic experience, things like having just more positive outlook, uniting one itself and other, like a sort of, you know, clarity of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7175" target="_blank">01:59:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">More labile in thoughts, more flexible thoughts.

You might give them some other name, but I'll use moods loosely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7261" target="_blank">02:01:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not perfect, but that's kind of one way that helps me think about hidden states where you have certain statistics of behaviors that you would produce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7269" target="_blank">02:01:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If I'm sad, there's certain things I'm going to do. It's a different statistics than when I'm happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7274" target="_blank">02:01:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Different probability of going surfing if I'm sad or happy or, you know, things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7279" target="_blank">02:01:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we basically found that there are a certain number of hidden states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7283" target="_blank">02:01:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you are on psychedelics, would that change the number of states or just the transitions between them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7289" target="_blank">02:01:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We also found in our prefrontal cortical representation that there's a certain distance of the representation of self and other in this, you know, dimensionality reduced activity space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7300" target="_blank">02:01:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So for mumbo jumbo, that just means there's a representation of self and other. There's some quantifiable distance in abstract, you know, terms in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7310" target="_blank">02:01:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can quantify if those representations get closer together and merge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7315" target="_blank">02:01:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Of self versus other. Of self versus other. So that's something that we would want, we would be looking for if you are putting psychedelics on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7323" target="_blank">02:02:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">These are questions that I'm interested in that are under construction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7326" target="_blank">02:02:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So right now we're recording from animals while we're giving them psilocybin using neural pixels recordings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7335" target="_blank">02:02:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're recording from thousands of neurons in prefabricordics and other parts of cortex because the, you know, the shank goes to lots of places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7343" target="_blank">02:02:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And looking at how animals respond in a conflict task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7350" target="_blank">02:02:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's trials where there's a cue that predicts reward, a cue that predicts shock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7355" target="_blank">02:02:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there's some trials where both cues are presented and both outcomes are presented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7359" target="_blank">02:02:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason for this conflict trial is that actually if you give, you know, moderate to low doses of psilocybin or most drugs, honestly, animals can do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7369" target="_blank">02:02:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, even on lots of different drugs, most people can still eat food and avoid getting hit by this truck.</span></div><div

course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7378" target="_blank">02:02:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But generally speaking, you know, there's a lot of different brain states where you can still do these essential functions pretty robustly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7386" target="_blank">02:03:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's about what happens in the more ambiguous zone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7391" target="_blank">02:03:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens when there's a conflict and what do you do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7395" target="_blank">02:03:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you -- when it's a little gray, I think that's when you can see a shift in valence assignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7401" target="_blank">02:03:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's something that we've been looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7403" target="_blank">02:03:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And trying to see if, you know, in clinical studies they're exploring set and setting as maybe the factors that have in the past historically given very unpredictable outcomes for psychedelic therapies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7418" target="_blank">02:03:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's possible that it's set and setting.</span></div><div class="c"><span

variability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7423" target="_blank">02:03:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's possible that there are biomarkers that can predict which individuals would be well suited for this type of therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7428" target="_blank">02:03:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those are also things that we're interested in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7437" target="_blank">02:03:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">These are fairly high level questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7439" target="_blank">02:03:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly there's a lot of clinical trials exploring psychedelics like psilocybin and their role in treating mental health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7446" target="_blank">02:04:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's at the same time a real dearth of studies exploring mechanistically how these compounds are working.</span></div><div

have explored dendritic changes and, you know, so cellular changes and the level of neurons and on and on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7461" target="_blank">02:04:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But in terms of these higher level states of self versus other recognition in psychedelics, you know, those are tough questions that need to be addressed mechanistically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7473"

target="_blank">02:04:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this this notion that you're testing of whether or not psychedelics reveal more accessibility or lability, as you described it, between different states, like, oh, wow, I can actually move from sad to happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7489"

target="_blank">02:04:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can experience that as opposed to just being told that when you're feeling sad, feel your, you know, the field of psychology, especially pop psychology, is in a real crisis right now, in my opinion, because we're told to feel our feelings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

So it doesn't look super surprising that I'm a professor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7676" target="_blank">02:07:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's not how it felt to me when I was in high school. I was a total rebel. I just threw parties at my house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7682" target="_blank">02:08:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">My parents were there. Sorry, everybody's listening. It's not I don't recommend that, but I just cared about I just cared about having fun and sports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7689" target="_blank">02:08:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think school wasn't maybe challenging enough for me at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7698" target="_blank">02:08:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't necessarily recognize that that was what it was. But I've always enjoyed being really active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7705" target="_blank">02:08:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what makes me feel good. It's I definitely agree with stuff you've said on your podcast about having exercise routines in the morning that really influence the rest of your day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7718" target="_blank">02:08:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't always exercise in the morning of different phases. But yeah, after I was an undergrad, I took some time to travel around Australia, a backpacker on Australia, live in some very remote places, spend some time living in a tent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7732" target="_blank">02:08:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I was a yoga instructor. Then I went to grad school in the Bay Area. I had a very active hobby of I was a semi-professional breakdancer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7745" target="_blank">02:09:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very into breakdancing. Really competitive breakdancer in the Bay Area. Yes, we did, you know, halftime shows or I guess technically third quarter timeout shows at Oracle Stadium for the Golden State Warriors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7757" target="_blank">02:09:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I was the one girl who could do a windmill, so they would use me. Okay, windmills. Someone's going to find footage of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7763" target="_blank">02:09:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. There's some, you know, very mediocre footage of me breakdancing. And I was just really into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7770" target="_blank">02:09:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that's where my work life balance passion comes from. I talk about it a lot. I think about it a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7777" target="_blank">02:09:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And people say to me all the time, "Well, is this really true? Why do you preach all this work life balance stuff when, you know, you must have been a workaholic at some point in your life?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7788" target="_blank">02:09:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, when I was younger, I definitely didn't like the idea that you had to only be one thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7796" target="_blank">02:09:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to be so many things. I couldn't decide. It was a huge challenge. I was going to be a writer. I was going to be a yoga instructor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7802" target="_blank">02:10:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I was going to be—I never really thought I was going to be a professional dancer. I just wasn't good enough. And there's not careers to be made from dancing, really. It's very difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7809" target="_blank">02:10:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I had a lot of other interests. And I wanted to prove—I don't know who I wanted to prove it to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7817" target="_blank">02:10:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think myself at first, and then eventually it made me feel like I should maybe prove it to everyone that you can have a very whole life and not sacrifice everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7827" target="_blank">02:10:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to choose between family and career or personal life. You can have them all. You just have to decide that it's a priority and own that and make those choices on a daily basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7840" target="_blank">02:10:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it comes down to time management. And so it's been a very—even though it looks like, "Oh, Kay just likes to have fun and have all these other hobbies,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7848" target="_blank">02:10:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's important because I think that we need more role models, especially in academic science, where people bring their whole selves to their job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7861" target="_blank">02:11:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And even though your job is a very specific thing, because you have a role as a mentor—and, you know, I suppose the mentor-apprenticeship relationship has evolved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7871" target="_blank">02:11:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's—I have lots of comments about that too in academia. I still think, ultimately, when I was working in someone else's lab and I definitely looked up to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7882" target="_blank">02:11:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They were the role model, obviously. I'm looking at—yes, there's science, but I'm looking at how they make this all work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7888" target="_blank">02:11:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">How are you doing this? How do they live their lives and how do they approach balancing it all?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7895" target="_blank">02:11:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I guess I just wanted to put some more data points on the scoreboard where people are having lots of hobbies and other non-work activities while still making meaningful contributions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7907" target="_blank">02:11:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it doesn't make you less of a scientist or less of a person because you're a whole human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7915" target="_blank">02:11:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If anything, perhaps it makes people better scientists. Did your exploration of yoga and/or breakdancing inform anything about your research?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7928" target="_blank">02:12:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Or was it really about resetting your mind and body in healthy ways so that you could return to the lab feeling excited about returning to the lab?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7937" target="_blank">02:12:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I've always been of the mindset where sometimes things don't go well in a certain arena and it's—it doesn't feel good to have all your eggs in that basket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7948" target="_blank">02:12:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Stuff goes wrong. Sometimes this experiment doesn't work. Sometimes you find something out, you lose the whole data set. It's, you know, bad news happens in the lab.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7956" target="_blank">02:12:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think—just want to diversify your portfolio so that your happiness portfolio is not entirely based on your accomplishments at work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7964" target="_blank">02:12:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we just want to have more elements. And the same thing goes for, you know, at one point when I was really into dancing, I got a very serious injury.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7972" target="_blank">02:12:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it took this huge part of my life away from me. I'm so glad I had work. Thank God I have work—you know, I have something I can do else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7979" target="_blank">02:12:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just think having a lot of different parts of your life make you more flexible, more creative, more awake, more engaged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7987" target="_blank">02:13:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, when I don't—I definitely have been a workaholic when I was a postdoc and assistant professor, period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=7994" target="_blank">02:13:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely did not make enough time for myself to have a richer—a rich personal life at certain points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8001" target="_blank">02:13:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And very quickly I just wither away into a shell of a human, a shell, an empty shell of the person I used to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8008" target="_blank">02:13:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's noticeable. Everybody can feel it. You can't pretend—you know, everyone that works with you feels it eventually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8015" target="_blank">02:13:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that's a big thing. And so as I've taken feedback from my anonymous lab surveys and other forms of feedback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8024" target="_blank">02:13:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and just reflecting, it's clear, you know, taking your lifestyle and having agency over designing your lifestyle to be ideal for you is super important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8038" target="_blank">02:13:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So a typical day for me might look like—okay, the last work day, let's say I woke up—actually, so it was early high tide,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8047" target="_blank">02:14:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so I got to wake up in the dark, pack up my bags, go surfing, and then get home before surf, see my friends in the water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8054" target="_blank">02:14:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think surfing is a lot of things. It's exercise. It's a cold plunge. It's photons, some of your favorite things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8061" target="_blank">02:14:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's maybe a little bit meditative, maybe some social community. Then—and I, you know, go every time at the same day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8068" target="_blank">02:14:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so there's the same group of people. Then I go home, make the kids their snacks, breakfast, drop them off at school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8074" target="_blank">02:14:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I go to a lab and then run lab meeting and have meetings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8082" target="_blank">02:14:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of my day when I'm at work is spent meeting with people, drawing on a whiteboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8087" target="_blank">02:14:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Mostly meeting with my trainees is what I like to spend most of my time on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8091" target="_blank">02:14:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, there's other stuff that gets in the mix, like administrative, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8094" target="_blank">02:14:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then come home at a pretty early hour, pick up my kids, make dinner, and then go to sleep kind of early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8101" target="_blank">02:15:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of boring these days.

ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8402" target="_blank">02:20:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But things change and where we

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8414" target="_blank">02:20:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">In one of the benefits of social media, I did have a tweet kind of, you know, just sort of spontaneously ranting about how this book is problematic and it's very misogynistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8426" target="_blank">02:20:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe we need another book for other types of people and that makes people feel more included.</span></div><div class="c"><span

come of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8441" target="_blank">02:20:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just, you know, living my daily life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8444" target="_blank">02:20:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then my D.M.

class="t">And then, okay, now I'm writing this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8450" target="_blank">02:20:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm about halfway through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8454" target="_blank">02:20:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the goal of the book -- I don't really have time for this project, to be honest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8459" target="_blank">02:20:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's such an important project to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span

places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8472" target="_blank">02:21:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is it second only to the

target="_blank">02:21:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8479"

know, factoid is academia is -- the military is worse in terms of sexual misconduct, retaliation issues that occur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8490" target="_blank">02:21:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But academia is second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8492" target="_blank">02:21:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it makes you wonder, what are the parameters that make this type of abuse so rampant?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8502" target="_blank">02:21:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the obvious ones is the clear ranks, how stable the ranks are, how the power structure of academia and the military very fixed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8514" target="_blank">02:21:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Not super debatable, not difficult to move these -- the ranks are, you know, they're there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8519" target="_blank">02:21:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the power structure is very skewed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8523" target="_blank">02:22:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are the ingredients that facilitate abuse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8529" target="_blank">02:22:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think in the military, I could see a very good argument for why that strict, rigid hierarchical structure is necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

of doing research in biology in particular, because that's what I'm familiar with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8665"

earlier you were telling me that you're doing this, that many of the people in your lab are first-time researchers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8736" target="_blank">02:25:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't come through the pedigree of research.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8740" target="_blank">02:25:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">About 25 percent of my lab this summer was first-time research experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8745" target="_blank">02:25:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've been really privileged to have the bandwidth to support that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8751" target="_blank">02:25:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say, though, I mean, on the same tip, I think what you've done with this podcast is incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8759" target="_blank">02:25:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You've made millions of people who didn't have access to science or neuroscience be fascinated with neuroscience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8765" target="_blank">02:26:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And now imagine what if every person that listened to this podcast and thought, "This is such a great podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8771" target="_blank">02:26:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I wish I could do some neuroscience," could do it with some, you know, not full-time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8776" target="_blank">02:26:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What if they could contribute in any, just whatever level that they wanted to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8781" target="_blank">02:26:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's so much more contribution that we're currently missing out on because there's so many barriers to be able to contribute to science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8788" target="_blank">02:26:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think removing the ones that are really there as well as the ones that are just perceived to be there is so powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8796" target="_blank">02:26:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But, I mean, the podcast is, you know, the proof is in the pudding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8801" target="_blank">02:26:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The proof is in this podcast how many people could fall in love with science if they were given a chance to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8807" target="_blank">02:26:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, thank you for that. It is indeed a labor of love for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8810" target="_blank">02:26:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are opportunities. Maybe we'll provide a link to a couple of them where certain projects in neuroscience are crowdsourcing data analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8819" target="_blank">02:26:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually quite fun. There's the Cactome Project where you can trace neurons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8823" target="_blank">02:27:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually very, very pleasing. You can do it while listening to podcasts or a book. Kids can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8827" target="_blank">02:27:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You're tracing these neurons, basically filling in lines. It's like a coloring book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8831" target="_blank">02:27:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're contributing to the parcellation of understanding the structure of the brain, including the human brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8838" target="_blank">02:27:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And without that crowdsourcing, it's just not going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8842" target="_blank">02:27:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there are efforts to make machine learning do it and to do it through A.I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8845" target="_blank">02:27:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot to be gained from having actual humans do this that those technologies don't quite yet approximate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8851" target="_blank">02:27:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll provide a link to some of those projects. But listen, K, Dr. Tai, of course, I want to thank you so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8862" target="_blank">02:27:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, for coming here today and sharing so much knowledge and also being willing to go into some places that were,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8869" target="_blank">02:27:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">by virtue of my questions, a little speculative and really think about those and address those through the lens of deep mechanistic understanding of how these circuits work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8879" target="_blank">02:27:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And to make it clear to people, your enthusiasm for science is infectious in the most positive sense of the word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8887" target="_blank">02:28:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know that so many people are going to benefit from from your knowledge and also from the work that you've been doing in your laboratory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8894" target="_blank">02:28:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've seen your star rise and it's still going, going, going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Sdgn0_kFM&t=8899" target="_blank">02:28:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just remarkable and extraordinary.
