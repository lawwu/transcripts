I'm your host, Joshua Sheets. I don't remember what episode today is, so we'll just wing that, and if you care too much about what episode it is, go to the blog and figure out what number is at the top of this. But today I am excited to do our first interview that's going to be going up on the podcast. And I'm going to be interviewing somebody who is one of my favorite online forum participants. I first found him over in the Mr. Money mustache forums. He goes under the screen name IP Daily, real name Will McClendon, and reached out to Will to interview him regarding how to save money on your cell phone bill. Interestingly, I think one of the things that I think about in our current culture, one of the expenses that we have, most people, that's different than 10 years ago, one of the few expenses that's higher than 10 years ago, is the fact that we spend on our mobile devices. It's absolutely huge. And so if we could figure out how to get all of the same usage and convenience and features, but do it for a lot cheaper, that would be a really good place to start. So with that, Mr. IP Daily slash Will, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. Great to be here, Joshua, and hello, greater endocrines. So you are the author of the world-famous, super guide to, let's see, I don't remember the title, the super guide to all things cell phone, VoIP, and communications guide over on the Mr. Money mustache. Why did you ever start writing that thing? I'm curious. Well, it wound up kind of coming out of several years' worth of research and experience on the subject, and after seeing Dahlink's article, or thread that they'd posted, I realized, there's so much information out there that really needs to be condensed down and presented in a concise format, and that's kind of what brought about the super guide and ultimately the online resource, their technical mashugana. I forgot to mention, yes, you blog over at techmashugana.com. Correct. And then any other online presence that you want to tell us about? Not here. Fair enough. Good call. So let's get people's attention, hopefully, because our goal today, if we succeed in this interview, our goal today is to provide, I don't know, maybe this will be an hour's audio that at the end of it is going to help people save tons and tons of money on their cell phone bills and on their communications bills. So let's get a little teaser here. Okay. So, Dahlink, why don't you go first. Walk us through what you spend every month, what you used to spend every month, and just a quick overview of the features and things that you have now and the price that you're paying, and then I'll go after you do. All right. Well, right now we're spending on average about $70 a month for two cell phones, home phone, business line, internet connection, and entertainment. Nice. And the average cost in America is $10. Yeah. So that's probably ... About $250 for the same thing. That would probably sound about right. So this is going to be good. So I'll tell you my story too. I used to spend, even just with AT&T back in the day, my wife and I used to spend 230 bucks a month for unlimited everything plans, talk, text, data, two iPhones and an iPad, and then plus all the rest of it. We've gotten it down in our household. We've gotten it down. So we've gotten it down to 10 bucks a month for my iPhone, 10 bucks a month for her iPhone, $15 a month for Comcast internet, and that is it. We do the TV stuff over there. So I think I've got you beat, but I'm about to add a VoIP phone, so that's going to go up probably a couple bucks a month. Yeah. So I'm edging up, but that's all right. I got the room. Under 40 bucks a month for the two of us. Well, considering the fact that you got lucky and only have to pay 15 bucks a month with Comcast, this is just absolutely phenomenal. I'd like to know how you pulled that off, honestly. I'll tell you. It's actually a story. So we moved into the house that we lived in about six months ago, seven months ago. And at that point in time, I was shopping for internet, and I started going around and trying to see. I actually jumped off of your Super Guide over to the, I think you recommended their broadband reports, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. So I jumped over to broadband reports, and I was trying to find what I could find. I didn't find any useful data from my area, which is Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, West Palm Beach, Florida, off of broadband reports or anything there. I tried kind of following all the links, didn't find anything. So I just said, "Well, let's see who's here," and it's Comcast and it's AT&T, U-verse. Oh, what a duopoly to choose from. Yeah, wonderful. So here was the deal. As I went online, the best deal was just right listed on the front of Comcast's website, and they were offering me something for $14.99 a month. They offered something for $14.99. So I was shopping around, and the best deal at that time that I could find was U-verse was offering something for $22 or $23.99. So I called Comcast. I said, "Hey, I want this deal." The rep said, "Oh, that deal's not available in your area." I said, "I just saw it on the website. What do you mean?" I put in my address and everything. He said, "No, it's not available." So I said, "Well, fine. I got to go back and shop it all." So I called back five minutes later, speak to a different rep. I say, "Hey, I'd like this $14.99 deal." They said, "Okay, no problem." So they gave it to me right over the phone. Five minutes later, the deal that wasn't available five minutes previously was now magically available with a different rep at $14.99 a month for Comcast. Well, is that a fixed thing or just for a year? I'm not sure because if it's a year, that's fine. I'm fine with it. I'll shop it again. I actually just got a letter in the mail, a flyer last week from U-verse offering it to me for $15.99, same price basically. So they must be trying to match Comcast. I asked the rep, I said, "Does this expire after a year? Is this an intro contract?" And they assured me on the phone that no, this was a long-term rate. Oh, wow. Score. I don't believe it. I don't really believe it because I think in another six months, it's probably going to jump up and I'll have to call and we'll play that whole game. But for now, it's working well. And thanks to you, I went with – that was a really cheap rate on the three – I think I have three megabits per second. And you, based on your guide, I decided, well, that's enough is the three megabits per second. But they were trying to push me up to the faster connection. Oh, of course they were. So you saved me lots of money already. So thank you. Excellent, excellent. Yeah, and I got to admit, yes, I'm spending about 70 bucks a month. You technically got me beat right now, but we don't have any – we're not under any contract. No contracts. This is the regular rate that we're paying. And I'm one of those people. I'm not a big fan of doing the monkey dance, trying to fight for an hour to get the bill back down a lot. Just the fact that what we're spending today is less than what we used to just spend with AT&T alone for our cell phone service, that's plenty enough for me. Why do I need to really push that much further down? Absolutely. I'm with you. So let's see. Let's start with what is going on in the world of cell phones and build the foundation for us. So if we're going to provide a useful guide to people, what are the basic building blocks that each person needs to look at to figure out what would be right for their situation? Well, if we're going to talk about recent news in the cell phone industry, we should probably hit on some of the recent news here. I've seen some news here lately coming out of T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. This whole jump program where they're trying to get people to pay more money to be able to continue to upgrade their devices every few months. Really? I haven't heard of that. Yeah. This is actually just like the past week or so that this has really started to come up. And it was on the heel of... Yeah. ...the heel of T-Mobile's supposed announcement of doing away with contracts and early termination fees, which let's be honest here. Okay. You're spending $70 a month with T-Mobile before they do away with their contracts. And when you were paying that $70 a month, you had a two-year contract where you had to pay for the phone and they wouldn't carry or unlock the phone for you. Yeah. And you couldn't go anywhere else or reduce your plan any. Now they offer you, say, a $60 a month plan where you're spending another $10 a month on a cell phone that you cannot carry or unlock for two years until it's paid off and you can't take your business elsewhere until you pay off the rest of the phone. Is it just me or does that sound like the exact same deal? Exactly. But on the heels of this announcement, well, if you want to call a few months heels, they wound up introducing the new Jump program to introduce another layer of contract to bleed customers for another $10 a month. And the reason why they are doing this is the reality of the American cell phone market is we're at market saturation. We have 110% market penetration in this country with cell phone usage. Wow. Interesting. Yeah. And it's still growing. And it's partly because of this. It's the tablet movement. You have no idea how many people wind up owning like two devices. It's insane. It really is. And they're getting desperate and they're trying to find ways to continue to work with the customer. Yeah. And they're trying to find ways to continue to bleed the customer for as much money as possible. And this has been the latest fad. Instead of actually giving people reasonable rates and allowing them the freedom to choose not because they've become an indentured slave to the cell phone carrier, but because the cell phone carrier is actually providing a good enough service to keep them. Okay. Go ahead. It's the complete opposite of what you'd expect in a free market capitalist society, let's be honest. I hear you, but I'm going to disagree with you a little bit. Because here's why. Wouldn't you say that isn't there – it's just my impression is that there's actually – the big four are going that direction, but there are lots and lots of other companies that are going that direction. Yeah. But there are lots and lots and lots and lots more choices coming out, especially if you're willing to switch over to the prepaid world. And so now, that's our job basically is to get the information out there, right? Yeah. But the thing is ultimately, we're still primarily dealing with the same big four carriers even though we're going through a third party that's buying in bulk. And this is not – this is not what you would consider straight up free market capitalism because if that were the case, we'd be operating not based on contracts and trying to get as much money out of the customer as possible, but actually offering an affordable service upfront to begin with and such a good service that you're willing to stay without a contract. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. All right. So let's start with – we're working off an outline here. Let's start with some myths that we've got listed here. Myth number one, prepaid versus postpaid. Well, that kind of goes into the insanity here within this country with cell phone usage. So many people here are conditioned to think that we need to be postpaid with our cell phone service because prepaid is for poor people and for criminals. Who need the throwaway phone that Jason Bourne buys in the train station in England. Yeah. But the reality is, is that we're – the United States and Canada is an aberration in the cell phone market. Europe and Asia alone are about 70% prepaid customers. Are you going to tell me that 70% of European cell phone buyers are poor and criminals? And I mean, India and Africa are over 95% prepaid. I want to say the global average of the roughly 6 billion cell phones working and operational in the world, I want to put it somewhere like 85%, 90% are prepaid. Mm-hmm. So clearly, prepaid is a good thing. Yeah. And prepaid in this country has just gotten a bum rap from the burner phones that you get down at Walmart, your track phones, your Net10 and the like. But the reality is, is that most of the world pays for what they get and not get billed for what they use. $3,000 for traveling to Europe with your phone. Yeah. And that's a lot of the money that you're going to be paying to Europe with your phone that you left the data on. Exactly. They're not going into contracts. They're not subsidizing their cell phone purchases. They're paying for the phones upfront for their actual value and they are paying for what they use, plain and simple. And there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. And I'm with you. I think prepaid seems like it was – back when cell phones were a thing. Back when cell phones were coming out of the bricks on your hip or the car phone type of era, it seemed like prepaid was an option. But it seems to me as a young guy that they seem to only ever work for the – like you said, the burner phone at Walmart. And so when you say, "I want a nice device. I want a fun device. I want something that does more for me," you don't usually traditionally think of prepaid. Exactly. But with my $10 a month, that's a prepaid plan and I love it. So next myth, unlimited anything. Well, let's face it. Nobody needs unlimited anything. I've lost track of how many people I've talked to who say they need like unlimited text and then I ask them, "Well, how many text messages are you sending a month?" And they're, "Oh, 500, 600." And it's like you're kidding me, right? On most prepaid plans, some of the cheapest text rates out there are 100. Some of the cheapest text rates out there are like two cents a text message. That 500 messages is $10. And you're telling me that you need to – you're not calling anyone. You're not using any data. But you need to send like 500, 600 messages a month. So that's why you're justifying spending something like $55, $60 a month on your cell phone service? Exactly. And that applies to minutes? That applies to minutes, data, messages, anything. I mean you don't need unlimited anything. And everything is finite. We're not talking about infinite minutes here. There's only so many hours a day that you can be awake and using this stuff. So be aware of what you're actually spending. Be aware of what you're actually using. And odds are you're not using near as much as you think you are. Daley, here's one important point though. You are right for adults. But from what I read about 13-year-old girls, the number of texts they can use, they might actually need unlimited texting, right? Don't get me started on teenage girls and texting. That will just derail the entire thing. All right. Next, data. Well, data, basically you don't really need as much data as you think. If you're using your phone as an actual honest-to-goodness portable emergency communications device, that means you're going to be using email, SMS text alternatives, maybe a little bit of GPS data or something like that, and very, very light web browsing to look up resources or whatnot. That's nowhere near as much data as you think it is. I mean, you could easily, you know, with the right phone and cutting out any streaming anything like streaming media or heavy, heavy GPS usage, you really don't need much data. I mean, we're talking about with some SMS text replacement applications like Kik and other things. I mean, you could easily, you know, with the right phone and cutting out any streaming anything like streaming media or heavy, heavy GPS usage, you really don't need much data. like Kik and XMS, we're talking close to, like, a thousand SMS-sized equivalent text messages and one megabyte of data. Wow. Well, the data thing is interesting, and it ties in with what you just said, unlimited anything. Because the thing that frustrated me, what finally got me, and here this AT&T, if you're listening, what finally got me, and I think I was an AT&T customer for at least a decade, probably more than a decade, what finally got me was for years I paid for an unlimited data plan. And because it was the original data plan, so I was grandfathered in and I couldn't get it, and I enjoyed using data. There would be all the data from the applications, just the normal apps that I would use. But then I also would love streaming. The reason I do a podcast is because I love streaming. I love streaming audio. I would stream hours of video off of YouTube. So I was a heavy data user. I think my record was something like five or six gigs one month. But any time I would get any heavy data usage, even with my unlimited plan, AT&T would send me this little pop-up thing on my phone that would say, "Well, you're near your cap, so we got to cut you down." So unlimited data didn't exist, and all I did was just change my usage a little bit. And quit streaming media over it, and just download podcasts before, and then watch videos when I'm on Wi-Fi. And it's worked well for me. It's amazing how much a little bit of preparation can do to pretty much gut your data usage. Yeah, exactly. And even if people are using... Because here would be one difference, is that even if people do have a lot of applications that they like to use a lot of times, most of them, at least my experience is, they don't actually use that much data. I would never... What is the average usage? It's one gig, right, in this country? Yeah, something like that. Even that seems embarrassingly high, honestly. It is. And if I didn't stream anything just from applications, it wouldn't be that much. It's not that much data from the applications. Yeah. Next, we've got on our outline here, hours. Hours? Well, hours are... You're talking about this 7:00 to 7:00 thing where you've got... Yeah. Well... And hours in the day? All that stuff has always seemed goofy to me. It's like all these little things of, "Okay, you get free cell... The thing I hear is this. I've got a family plan. So I get my six friends that I always talk to and I put them on my family plan. And, you know, so we get free usage between after 7:00 PM and..." Like you said, how often do you really spend four hours on the phone? If you have a girlfriend or something, that's your one person that you talk to. I get it. But it seems... Well, it ties back into the unlimited anything. You don't need unlimited data. You don't need unlimited hours. You... Again, you only have a finite amount of time. And trying to game for prime times or anything like that, that's wasting your own time. You should have the freedom to be able to just talk whenever you need to. And when you're trying to utilize their off-peak hours or whatnot to be able to get that unlimited time, to game the system to try and keep your costs down lower, you're just... It speaks to a need for situational awareness, honestly. Yeah. And honestly, if you're waiting until after 8:00 PM to make a call anyway, you're probably already home. And you might as well take advantage of much cheaper data and phone services at home than using your mobile service. Yeah. All right, here's my favorite. "Daily, I'm going to save so much money to bundle my internet and my cable TV and my cell phone and my car payment, all in the same payment." Ah, yes. What's known to the insiders in the industry is the triple play. Being able to get the phone, the internet, and cable TV all together in one package. You know why they love selling you bundled packages? Because they can inflate the bills that they want to charge you just that much more. Yeah. I'll tell a little personal story. Years ago, I used to work for a market research company. And one of the things that we... One of the many... We worked a lot with fast food restaurants. And we worked with a famous fast food restaurant brand. And I got to see some of the data that they used. And it's very interesting. This particular brand, at one point, was offering these huge burgers with multiple, multiple patties. So, you know, you can have the one patty burger, the two patty burger, the three patty burger, and the four patty burger. And you look at the four patty burger, and the thing is the size of your head. And you say, "What person would ever eat the hamburger that looks like that?" Well, what the research showed very consistently is that the biggest burger that was on the menu was a three patty burger. The restaurant might serve a total of five of them, and they would sell in one day five of them. But, you know, they would sell lots and lots of two patty burgers. But if they put a four patty burger on the menu, they would sell maybe like four of the four... Four or five of the four patty burgers. But they would sell dozens and dozens and dozens of the three patty burgers. So everyone would go from the two patty up to the three patty. And to me, that's like bundling, is that, "Well, listen, I probably don't need this, you know, this 483-channel package on my cable TV. I don't need necessarily, you know, 50 gigs of speed on my... I don't even know what the speed ones are... 50 megabytes of speed on my internet. But if I bundle it all together, it's only $342 a month." Yeah, exactly. And, I mean, the thing is, is if I had actually, you know, gone for the triple play with Cox to where I'm paying for even just basic cable TV, you know, basically getting the exact same stations I get over the air with the rabbit ears for free. And bundled our home phone with them and the internet, I would probably be spending somewhere in the neighborhood of about $130, $140 a month instead of $70. So it just goes to show, as long as you keep control of who you get your services provided from, you are always going to be able to get a deal cheaper than trying to bundle everything into one bill with someone else. It may be slightly more convenient. It may be slightly more convenient for billing purposes, only paying one company, but how much of your money is worth that convenience? Yeah. And seriously, put it on an automatic payment off your credit card and it's just as convenient. Yeah. All right. Business use versus home use. Well, the whole business use versus home use, if you're using your phone for business use, then your employer should be paying for it. So if you're using the whole excuse of, I have to use my cell phone X number of minutes because it's for business, then yeah, you can justify maybe a postpaid contract or something with one of the major carriers, but honestly, under those situations, your employer should be paying for it. Not you. And I mean, home use, again, if you're using it at home. Why are you on your cell phone? Why are you on your cell phone? It is specifically designed to be a mobile device. And you've got to think about this stuff. If you know what you're getting into and what you're using it for, you can figure out how to better save on it. And the thing with mobile services is it's expensive to be mobile. So why are you using mobile services when you're stationary? Yeah. And on that point, I think this is one of the reasons why stuff changes so much is because it used to be that using the cell phone was expensive. So people would have the cell phone as being expensive and then they would use the home line. And then what happened is cell phone prices seemed to come down so much. People said, "Well, I use the cell phone. I prefer that. Now I'll just dump the home line." And so my wife and I don't have any kind of wired line. And that's where we get into VoIP, voice over IP. And if you don't have a voice over IP solution, then not using the cell phone thing doesn't make any sense. So you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play, but once it does, like you said, it's a lot of work. And then you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play. So you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play. And then you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play. And then you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play.
