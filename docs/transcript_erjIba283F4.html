And oftentimes, there are not a lot of places where you feel you can get information that is unbiased, and that's what this conference is. - For me, the value has been being able to meet people during the breakout sessions, during the breakfast, during the lunch, passing in the hall.</p><p>- I loved kind of being immersed in the community. Vogelheads are like the smartest people I know. - We had access to talk to the speakers, and they are all very down-to-earth and very welcoming for us to walk up to them and talk to them. And just to be able to chat with them one-on-one, face-to-face, it's just an in-person experience.</p><p>You can't get watching them or reading a book. - You can listen to YouTube and podcasts and online, and there's so much information out there. I think what the Vogelhead Conference does is bring it all together in one place. - If you're interested in investing, it's really terrific. Even if you're just getting started, I think I would encourage everyone to attend this.</p><p>- Get here, get here, this will be your best experience. It's kind of become like a family affair. - It's like a love fest every time we see these people, and we just keep coming back.
