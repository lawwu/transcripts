What are the hidden capabilities?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Why they matter and how they light up? I work on VS Code. So this is a bias local MCP for development track, but all of it is applicable to everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I really love the intro to the track. It's all about its MCPs on high velocity. It's a lot of ecosystem growth, excitement, people working together, collaborating, but there's so much more work to do if they realize it's so early in that ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The criticism of the spec or the ecosystem is just we're so early and I want to point out where we can gain more powers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And just 10 days ago on a Friday, we had actually this first in real life gathering of the MCP Steering Committee during the MCP Dev Summit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how early it is. We haven't even met before. We just talked on Discord so we finally met in person the first time to talk about anything, how to evolve the spec, how to evolve the ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And all the basics are kind of covered. Hopefully in the previous talks. This is my first MCP talk that I don't spend halfway through just explaining what MCP is. There's routes and the client, there's sampling, there's prompts and tools and resources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a really rich ecosystem to build dynamic discovery and persistent resources and rich interactions. But there's a gap in how this is being implemented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There's this MCP is just another API wrapper syndrome that's happening because people just want to ship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They want to build products and they're actually building really excellent products with just tools. And that creates this reinforcing loop because once you see how MCP works, you're just going to use the same stacks and repeat the same tools only ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's technical barriers. People do this because there's missing support in the clients and SDKs and documentation and the references. And the clients reflect this most. If you look at the adoption that's from the website of model context protocol, you see everybody goes for tools because that's where the most immediate success is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're honest, most of the resources and prompts, you can do similar flows just with tools. And VS Code did the same thing. When we launched two weeks, two months ago now with our MCP support, we started with tools and we already added discovery and routes because you're working towards actually reading the spec and implementing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm happy to announce that with VS Code's upcoming release v1.10. Don't get it wrong. But it's already an insiders now. So download it. We actually have the full spec support and that's I want to talk about here about all the other things that people are not using yet. Yes, that's why I'm clapping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so the message is if you go with full MCP spec support, you will can unlock these rich stateful interactions that MCP vision is really outlining on how agents should work together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Starting with the most obvious tools. So not going too deep here, but tools reflect actions. Well defined performing actions and mostly easy mapping to function calling if you're used to that. And on the right side, you see playwright, you can start a server, it will open the browser and take a screenshot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But tools are often leading to quality problems. And we all struggle with that. Raise your hand if you had like some error in your IDE that you couldn't add more tools and you couldn't run it or run wrong tools because you have too many.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's research from Langchain that nicely underlines that and pointing out the three vectors of A, it's too many tools. So AI gets confused by that. It's too many domains of tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you suddenly have some different properties for each tool and instructions coming with each tool, then it also gets confused versus just a pure like this is UI testing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, it's just the repetition. The more repetitions of the AI has to do to actually run tools to solve a problem, the easier it is to get confused as well. So it's really quality over quantity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And clients handle that somewhat. They give you extra controls. Like in VS Code, we added actually per chat tool selection. So there's a little tool packer and you can actually reduce down the tools of what you actually need in the moment versus all the tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It has nice keyboard accessibility. It's really quick to set up and will persist for the session. So that's one way. We have actually mentioning of tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like sometimes you're like pull this issue and trying to like verb out whatever tool you're trying to invoke. Like why not just use this tool and please make up all the right parameters to use it properly and then use the other tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what we allow as well. And lastly, just in this insiders actually we're shipping user defined tool sets. And that's more of a usable concept. Once you get into the mode like these are all the tools I need for a front end testing flow, then you just put those into a tool set and that use my front end testing flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's coming as well. So these are all user controls. But actually that spec has dynamic discovery built in. And that means on the fly a server can say equals, but actually that spec hack are going to give you these other tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the right, you see GitHub MUD MCP. It's on GitHub. You can check it out. And this starts with a chat mode that I created that puts the agent into a game master prompt and it has the MUD MCP installed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So now with the mode active, I can go into the agent, switch to MUD, and play the game. And what's dynamic tool discovery does here, it actually makes it aware of which room I am in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So dungeon crawl, you walk from room to room, you can go east and north, you can pick up stuff. And if there's a monster, I can battle the monster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But the tool for battling shouldn't be there when there's no monster. Eventually, I advance through the game and I finally find a goblin I can battle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And the battle tool appears. I can battle the goblin. So imagine those MCPs you want to work on. Those are coming up to give servers and clients a little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Really, tools or actions. Actually, the add context. Return a giant file from your server, but you want to return a reference to the file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that could be something the LLM could follow up on or the user can actually act upon. Then the other use case is actually giving files to the users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you take a screenshot by a playwright, it's going to expose it to both the LLM and the user, and resources provide that semantic layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what are the issues? Oh, I found your issue. That's . They want to understand the Python environment and maybe look at your settings of how you set it up so they can customize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that makes it more dynamic and stateful out of the box. The other one is if you can look at actual packages and your libraries installed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a great way to customize it to a React setup versus a Svelte setup and really acknowledging what the user is looking at and not asking constantly, like, what framework are you working on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">What framework are you working on? Like, just-- you work in my folder. So just look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, I think the idea of, like, what is that CI/CD pipeline? That's where MCP servers really shine to connect the end-to-end of a developer experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can also read those out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Sampling. Who has heard about sampling? Is really excited about sampling?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so you understand what I mean. So sampling-- sampling is one of the oddly named primitives as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it had a better name, maybe more people would use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's actually now Implant Insiders, and it's so much fun to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it allows the server to request LLM completions from the client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'm showing here on the right is the permission dialog that pops up to allow the server to access the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now, it's wired up by default to GPT 4.1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There's more spec improvements to make it more structured formatting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some ideas out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of things to make it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But right now, nobody has implemented it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So there wasn't really need to make it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But implementations are here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So please use sampling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a nice progressive enhancement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe by default, you return the kitchen sink.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And once you have sampling, you can do interesting things like summarizing resources into more tangible things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You can format a website that you fetch into markdown for the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can even think about agentic server tools that run via the LLM from the client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look beyond the primitives, there's a few things that are also interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So far, we have routes and tools and resources and prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Apparently, it's really easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe it's not a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have now a dev mode in VS Code, which is a little dev toggle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And you already see the console that always works for all MCP servers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you hit a snack, that just works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then now it's in debugging mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually has the debugger attached.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So once I run the prompt, which is dynamically generated on the server, I can now hit the breakpoint and step through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really hard usually because your server is not owned usually by any process that you run manually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's owned by whatever client and host is running the MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So because VS Code is both, it can just put it into debug mode and attach its debugger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that works for Python and Node right now out of the box.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has changed how I work on MCPs, definitely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The latest spec was already called out.</span></div><div

important that people stay on the tip of the spec on what's coming and understand what's in draft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Those things that are in draft only become stable because people provide feedback that is useful and that it's working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they're in draft and nobody provides feedback, then they will still go into stable and they might need revisions like the off spec.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So the updated off spec on the right gives this enterprise-grade authorization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a talk tomorrow about building protected MCP server that I can highly recommend from then who actually worked on the off spec.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to talk to one of the people behind it and want to dive really deep into off, you can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Then streamable HTTP has been working in VS Code since two versions as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But then it's been really hard to test because there's no servers out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExeD-8gFUMM&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you work on hosting, you're really excited about streamable
