href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about the changes, and I think my slide has an animation,</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">A bunch of increases across benchmarks people care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's Soda on Ader, and it's Soda

think it closes the gap on a bunch of the stuff that folks gave us feedback on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">from the previous versions of the model, so hopefully it has great performance across the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It also, I think, is sort of setting the stage for the future of Gemini.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think 2.5 Pro for us internally, and I think in the perception from the developer ecosystem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">was the turning point, which was super exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's awesome to see the momentum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got a bunch of other great models coming as well.</span></div><div

version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Send us feedback if things don't work, and we'll continue to push the rock up the hill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=123"

launched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about a year of Gemini progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this has been the craziest thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know if folks tuned in to Google I/O, but Sundar showed this slide on stage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think was a great reminder for me of just how much--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, it feels like 10 years of Gemini stuff packed into the last 12 months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">which has been awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's actually interesting to see as well, just to sort of opine on one of the points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like all of these different research bets across DeepMind coming together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to like build this incredible mainline Gemini model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is actually like I have a conversation with people all the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but like what is-- what's the DeepMind strategy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the advantage for us building models, all that good stuff?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the interesting thing to me is just this breadth of research happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">across like science and Gemini and all these other areas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">like robotics and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And all that actually ends up upstreaming into the mainline models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is super exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So you see like the alpha proof and alpha geometry and a bunch of stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that we did with custom models in those areas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">actually improving the performance of our models for those domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jack will talk about that in a little bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which I'm super excited about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing is just like not just the pace of innovation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but the pace of adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think Sundar also showed this slide,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which was a 50x increase in the amount of AI inference that's being processed through Google servers from one year ago to last month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that is just remarkable to see the amount of increase in demand for Gemini models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">also from the external developer ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's been wonderful to see that happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the other question, and I think this is like talked about a little bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which is sort of what got us to this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the critical pieces and like it's, you know, not super fun,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but is worth thinking about for folks who are building companies here is like an organizational thing, truthfully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I think you bring together Google historically had lots of different teams doing lots of different AI research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And in late 2023, early 2023, Google brought a bunch of those teams together and sort of charted this new direction for the DeepMind team to not only just like do theoretical foundational research,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but also to like build models and deliver them to the rest of Google and also the external world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we took the second step of that journey later earlier this year, which was actually bringing the product teams into DeepMind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So now DeepMind creates the models, does the research, but then also builds products and delivers those to the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we have the Gemini app, which is our consumer product, and then we have the developer side of that with the Gemini API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And this has been like personally for me super fun to get to collaborate with our research team and like help actually be on the frontier with them and bring new models and capabilities to the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is like the collaboration that works, works incredibly well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and we ship lots of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is the, this is the most fun part is there's so much stuff, so much innovation happening inside of Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, it's incredible to get to bring that to the world and bring that to developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we're actually very early in that journey and as we'll, we'll see in a couple of minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So in summary, the formula is simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Bring the best people together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Find info advantages and ship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if folks have played around with VO or not, but it's also been just incredible to see the reception to VO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's burning all the TPUs down, which has been incredible to see lots of demand, lots of interest on the VO front.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully folks get a chance to play around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's available in the Gemini app right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so let's talk about what next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the fun stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the, the sort of Gemini app piece is interesting just because people talk about it a lot and it's, it's a fun product and it's cool to think about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And also sort of, I think for folks building stuff, it's interesting to hear like what our strategy is from the app perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But the Gemini app is trying to be this universal assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think what that means in practice is if you, I'm sure people don't think about this all the time, but I think a lot about like what Google's products do and sort of how we show up in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the interesting observations I had was that if you think about what was the thing that like brought people, individuals through all of Google's products historically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the thing that comes to mind is like, like your Google account, I guess, which like wasn't like super stateful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You would sort of sign into lots of different Google products with your Google account, but that didn't really do anything other than just like get you signed into that individual product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think now we're seeing with Gemini that it's actually this thread that unifies all of Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the future for Google is going to look a lot like Gemini is this sort of, you know, thread that brings all of our stuff together, which is really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then hitting on all the trends, which I'm sure folks are also excited about building, I think the one that I'm most excited about is proactivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think most AI products today are still very like, you have to go and do all the work as the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this proactive next step of AI systems and models coming into play is going to be is going to be awesome to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and the team is moving super fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.380</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But he is the person who can make stuff happen on the Gemini app side, not me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So please tag him.</span></div><div

much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">When Gemini was originally created, it was built to be a single multimodal model to do audio, image, video, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We've made a lot of progress on that at I/O this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We announced native audio capabilities in Gemini.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There's TTS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There's audio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You can talk to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds super natural, which is awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's powering the Astra experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's powering Gemini Live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we're going to get towards that omnimodal model, which is awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We have VO, which is soda across a bunch of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully we'll get video into the mainline Gemini model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If folks saw some of our early experiments with diffusion, which means you can get like crazy levels of tokens per second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like definitely a research exploration area, and it's not mainline yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'll be cool to see that come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The agentic by default thread, I think, is something that I've been thinking a lot about recently, which is like historically, for me as a developer, I've thought about models just as this thing that gives me tokens in and out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there was lots of scaffolding in the ecosystem to allow me to build those models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's becoming very clear to me that the models are becoming more systematic themselves, like they're doing more and more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the reasoning step is this like really interesting place in which a lot of that's going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jack's going to talk about the scaling up of reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think it'll be interesting to see like how much of the scaffolding work that's happened in the past ends up just like being a part of that reasoning step and like what that means for people who are building products and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'll be interesting to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll also have more small models soon, which I'm excited about, and big models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">People want large models, which I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm excited about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last one is continuing to push the frontier on infinite context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the current model paradigm doesn't work for infinite context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's just like impossible to scale up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Attention doesn't work that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there'll be some new innovations to hopefully help let people continue to scale up the amount of context that they're bringing in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And Tulsi is the person who drives all of our model stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have stuff, you want to talk about Gemini models, you have ideas for things that don't work well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">She is the person running the show on the Gemini model product side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then developer stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have lots of things coming, which I'm excited about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'll highlight maybe three that I think people are super excited about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Embeddings, I think we have, which is, you know, feels like early AI stuff, but I think it's still super important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Embeddings power most people's applications using RAG.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a Gemini embeddings model, which is state of the art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So excited to be rolling that out to developers more broadly in the next couple of weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The deep research API I'm super interested in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's so many interesting products that are built around this sort of research tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And people love the consumer products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're finding ways to bring a bunch of that together into a, like, bespoke deep research API, which will be awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then VO3 and Imagine 4 in the API as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully we'll see that very, very, very soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we work to scale and make that possible from a developer platform side, I'll make one other quick comment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.880</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:11:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, AI Studio, just to be very clear, is being built as a developer platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll sort of move away from this, like, kind of consumer-y feel and move much more towards being a developer platform,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which I'm personally very excited about because I think that's what developers want from us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'll be awesome to see that actually come to life with, like, many new iterations of our developer experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">with agents built in and hopefully things like Jules and some of our developer coding agents natively in that experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which will be awesome to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1ZCmCLP5g&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what I have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
